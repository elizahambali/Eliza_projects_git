trend puts pressure on rival samsung maker of highend android smartphones

seoulconsumers around the world are increasingly choosing  apple incs iphones over highend android smartphones with younger users seen as pushing the company toward the level of dominance in the market globally that it has enjoyed in the us

from europe to asia apples market lead in the premium bracket  is growing and polls show that people in their teens and early 20s  known as gen z increasingly see the iphone as a musthave converts say  they are drawn by its design cameras and airdrop features for sharing  photos

the trend is putting apples chief rival samsung electronics co under pressure and threatening the south korean  companys lead in the overall global smartphone market samsung has been  promoting its splashy foldable phones and 100x zoom cameras on the latest galaxy s23 ultra that brought a wow from elon musk on twitter

in samsungs backyard where the brands android smartphones have held sway apples clout has been growing since the company opened its first store in south korea  in 2018 apple now has four stores in the country where its  mobilepayment system apple pay will soon become available for the first  time

around 52 of people age 18 to 29 in south korea were using an  apple smartphone as of 2022 up from 44 two years earlier according to  polls by gallup korea samsungs share of this age group slipped to 44  from 45 in that time the polls showed for all older age groups  samsung phones remain most prevalent

chung kyungrim a 22yearold college student in seoul said nearly  all of her peers use an iphone apples reputation for prettier designs  and good photos has stuck through the years she said though she thinks  samsungs devices have improved in looks and likes the diverse colors of samsungs latest flip phones she said

apples rise among young people will likely help the us  firms position in the highend phone business that it has been leading  apples share of worldwide shipments of smartphones priced at 800 and  above grew to 76 last year from 65 in 2018 while samsungs declined  to 17 from 27 according to canalys a techmarket researcher china  has been one major driver of growth for apple after us sanctions crippled another rival huawei technologies co

samsung remains the worlds largest smartphone maker by overall  shipments a title it has held since 2012 even here apple is closing  in on its rival samsungs market share has held roughly steady at  around 21 for the past five years according to canalys while apples  share climbed to 19 in 2022 from 15 in 2018

highend smartphones are critical for phone makers as they  bring in the biggest profits and showcase technological capabilities and  leadership said tom kang a seoulbased director at counterpoint  research

the pricier phone segment also represents a pocket of resilience in  an industry that has been sliding last year global shipments of  smartphones priced above 800 grew 1 while overall shipments of  smartphones fell 12 according to canalys

a samsung spokesman noted that preorder volumes for the recently launched galaxy s23 smartphone series were higher than for the prior years models with 60 of consumers choosing the mostexpensive galaxy s23 ultra

apple didnt respond to a request for comment

in the us where apple accounted for 77 of the  premiumsmartphone market last year according to canalys one reason for  the popularity of iphones among young people has been the prevalence of  imessage apples messaging app that is widely used and designates different colors for iphone users and android users

elsewhere in the world that is seen as less of an edge because thirdparty mobile messengers are more mainstream from whatsapp in europe to kakaotalk in south korea

young people around the world say they are attracted by  appleexclusive features such as airdrop which enables easy sharing  between iphones between friends and preferences for apples photography  and design

for years apples marketing has focused on taking cinematic photos and videos

todays topend iphone and samsung galaxy smartphone both have  similar camera components and excel at capturing quality highresolution  photos said choi kabsoo a travel photographer living in seoul who  runs smartphonephotography classes

some differences in the color expression of the photos might  make people feel that apples phones take better photos in everyday  settings said mr choi who uses an iphone

sarah carrivale a 24yearold graduate student living in  paris has noticed that more people around her age are using  iphonesaround 7 in 10 she estimates

she switched to an iphone 12 two years ago after using a  string of android devices including ones from samsung and a chinese  brand after taking a while to get used to the iphone she said she is  satisfied with its durability ease of navigation and cameras

once you get an iphone in a way theres no turning back ms carrivale said

across western europe android users under the age of 25 were  almost three times more likely to prefer apple for their next smartphone  than older age groups according to a poll last year by canalys of  4000 individuals from the uk germany spain and italy apple users  under 25 were more than twice as likely as android users of the same age  to stick with their respective operating systems the poll showed

apps on an iphone feel faster and more glitchfree even if the  specs are similar to an android device said nicholas leonzi a  26yearold retail worker in london he tried out a samsung galaxy s21  ultra in 2021 which had cool features  like charging his galaxy buds pro earphones on the back of the phone a  regular phone upgrader he reverted back to apple after a year and is using the latest version of the airpods pro

apple has also grown by building its products based on the same  operating system helping strengthen user retention and brand loyalty  android smartphones have far more players in the mix because it isnt a  closed operating system like apples

as younger consumers grow stickier to the apple ecosystem itll become harder for samsung to compete with apple said                       nicole peng          a canalys senior vice president

samsung which leads the android segment is working to catch up  by focusing efforts on making its products from smartphones to tvs to  appliances and those of partner brands work together in the most  hasslefree manner possible

one bright spot for samsung is that it is leading the foldablesmartphones category  it helped pioneer sales of foldable phones represent less than 1 of  the smartphones shipped worldwide today but their increased popularity  could boost samsungs future position in the premium category analysts  say apple has yet to announce any plans for foldable phones

lee hyejin whose highschoolage daughter and son have owned  iphones since middle school in seoul highlighted the iphones appeal to  younger generations she estimated that 7 out of 10 of her childrens  classmates are iphone users

they say its more hip to use apple she said"
