From S22 Ultra to an S23+ I LOVE IT!,14,11hk8ct,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11hk8ct/from_s22_ultra_to_an_s23_i_love_it/,15,"Hello all, I talked about it for a while and yesterday I acted on it. I'll sum it up, I had an s21 Ultra, and loved it but hated the size. Best buy had a killer deal and I got an s22 ultra for $15 paid for outright(essentially a free new phone). But I wanted an S22+ because of the form factor. Fast forward to now, and I wanted to buy an S23+.

I went to my local best buy and bought an S23+ by trading in a cracked galaxy s7 I got from eBay for $40. I also received a $100 Best Buy gift card. I did the bill credit thing but I don't mind. Today I sold my s22 ultra for $600 cash and am very happy! In the end, after I subtract the taxes, the new phone case, the s7 phone, and the $199 balance over the next 3 years, I'm up $220 cash and a $100 gift card plus a free galaxy s23+! (I also turned the cracked s7 into a Verizon store for the $800 bill credits)

Onto the phone! I LOVE the battery life! I thought it was overhyped but it's real! 

My S22 Ultra SOT was 4-6.5 hours MAX with 1080p mode(not 1440p) It was always dying with minimal use.

My S23 Plus SOT is 7-9 hours! Same usage! It's insane how a 300mah small battery can outperform an Ultra series phone. I can only imagine the S23 ultra sot! 

Overall it's an upgrade for me! I like the smaller size, I have 256gb now vs the 128gb, love the battery life and I LOVE the flat screen! I am so happy with the device! Samsung did a great job! This is honestly how the S10+ was to me when I first got it! 

I plan to keep it for 36 months :)",1677889956.0
Opinions on the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra for Digital Art / Clip Studio Paint?,9,11hjd6w,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11hjd6w/opinions_on_the_galaxy_tab_s8_ultra_for_digital/,3,"Hi all,

I am a hobby artist. I occasionally sell commission work.

One piece of technology I have wanted since 2010 was a portable digital sketchbook.

I have always used Windows for my computer OS. I use a Samsung Galaxy phone currently. I have enjoyed Android far more than iOS.

The idea of having a tablet that would pair up easily with my current workspace is exciting. I'm excited about the idea of being able to use my preferred art program of Clip Studio Paint with all the brushes and assets I have for it already rather than Procreate. I also like that CSP pairs with your smartphone while using a tablet for easy access to shortcuts. I know CSP requires a separate subscription plan to use on a tablet versus a desktop, but that's not really an issue to me.

I also recall in one review that certain Wacom pens work with the S8 Ultra. I think it's just the Wacom One pen, but I would be interested in hearing about any other options. 

I currently use a Huion Kamvas Pro 16 screen tablet to draw on. It stays tethered to my desktop.

So many artist buddies recommend an iPad Pro and iPencil combo. The only real advantage an iPad and iPencil have is less visible lag/stroke latency. I find it more convenient to stick with Windows OS items.

The S8 Ultra does have visible lag in the S-pen on review videos during screen extension use, as well as within Clip Studio Paint if a high stabilization setting is turned on.

If any artists have a screen tablet similar to a Cintiq or Huion as well as an S8 Ultra, does having a portable tablet help your workflow? How easy is it for you to transition your active files/projects between your desk space and mobile space? Do you notice a lag in the pen strokes in certain programs or settings? 

I am also hoping that incorporating this tablet into my study space will help me with college studies, as I imagine that annotations and notes will be easier with the dual workspace option and marking directly on the document.

What other recommendations or suggestions would you have? Thanks for reading!",1677887850.0

I shower while my phone is on the counter and play music. Today while I got off the shower I grabbed the phone and boom dropped it on the bathroom counter. Ok, it happened before ill just pick it up but when I tried to use it...

Pro Tip: eSim can make your phone trackable if lock or stolen,108,11g7s4m,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11g7s4m/pro_tip_esim_can_make_your_phone_trackable_if/,84,"For all those unaware if your telecoms carrier allows you to use eSims I highly recommend that you switch to one if it's not an inconvenience.

Samsung phones require a password to turn the phone off if you're phone is locked. If someone who stole your phone removes your sim card it will be harder to track your cellphone. With an eSim installed as long as you have power and data, your phone will be able to send you its location. Otherwise, you're relying on Samsung Smarthings Find Network which only uses other Samsung phones' Bluetooth networks to help you find your phone.

This also works great for travelling too. I use an eSim app and just pay for data when I travel. It's easy to install and when the plane lands I can turn off airplane mode, toggle the new eSim on and have data right away.

This only works for people who have password/fingerprint/faceid locks on their phone and who don't need to move their sim around to other devices.

I hope this helps make Samsung phones less desirable to steal or keep!

I am not saying it's bad. It's better than other samsung phones, but it's not as good ass see others say.
So i've a theory that it might be a manufacturer difference between the Middle East versions and others, or maybe there is another difference. What do you think?

Will there be a significant difference upgrading from LG B7A to Samsung's S95C?,2,11gp3sz,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11gp3sz/will_there_be_a_significant_difference_upgrading/,2,"I  have a 65"" B7A and IF ignoring the price of the 77"" S95C from Samsung,  will there be a noticeable difference in picture quality or will it  pretty much be the same? I was of course blown away by the B7A coming  from my previous set (Samsung UN60JU6400) as everything pop out and it  actually took a bit of time to get use to as everything seem too  realistic.

I don't expect that  major of a difference, but wondering if it's worth an upgrade for  picture quality alone or not. I don't do any gaming on TV. I use the  standard apps from LG, so Netflix & Disney +. Only watch selective  shows on YouTube TV and then I may watch some shows or movies from my  hard drive. I may get Apple TV 4K, not sure if that will increase  quality or at least stop my LG from constantly buffering despite having a  perfect wireless internet connection.",1677811775.0

I want to upgrade, as A20e is slow as hell and is soon to lose security support (this is key for me). My main phone is an iPhone, but i usually buy Samsung for me and my family when i need Android alternatives (my parents have A52S and A53 for instance), mainly due to the extended update support.

Checking the Samsung website i saw a deal on the Galaxy A33, where you get the phone (in blue, 6+128) with free Galaxy Buds2 (in black) for a total of 284€ (normally the pack is 299 but there is a 5% off coupon). You could take it a bit lower in educational discounts for 249€ but without Buds2.

I know that the Galaxy A34 is close to be released this month, but will probably cost more than this (at least 369€, and rumors say a possible increate to 420-430€). It should also have a Dimensity processor instead of Exynos. A33 should still have 3 year of OS-upgrades + 4 security patches in store, which is really nice for me. New phones released this year from other manufacturers will have less support than A33.

Would you say buying the A33 with this offer is worth it for the intended use, or should i wait for the A34?

It all started when I wanted to leave Apple so I started looking and only heard good things about Samsung.

Then I started to understand that they tricked me to get into a closed ecosystem like apple. Then I started to litsen to Luise Rohsman on YouTube and even if I don't like everything he stands for I agree that a 1500$ device that I HAVE PAYED FOR should me MINE and not locked. Then they stoped having Micro SD card expansion. Then tried to stop right to repair and removed the Charger that came in the box. They have had so many chances to be good but the choose to not do them. Thats the Phycologick definition of **EVIL**!!!!!!!

Thinking of switching to S23 ultra (lifetime IPhone User),8,11fc3uw,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11fc3uw/thinking_of_switching_to_s23_ultra_lifetime/,47,"Hey guys and girls, you probably get so many of these posts but I thought I would post as I'm at a big crossroads for myself.

I'm a lifelong Apple user, IPhone 14 pro max, AirPods Pro/ Max, AirTags, Apple Watch Ultra and the list goes on. But the problem is I'm just bored, it works, it all works seamlessly with little problems but at the same time with no excitement anymore, and as someone who loves tech and new features Apple just isn't doing anything innovative for me.

I tried the S22 ultra when it came out last year along with the watch 4 classic and I did really like them but I was so far into the Apple ecosystem that everything just felt odd and eventually I changed back. Now the S23 range is out and my head won't let me go 5 mins without thinking about switching.

But if I'm truly honest with you l'm slightly afraid to do so. My entire family is Apple and iMessage is just so easy, I use FaceTime for weekly calls and AirPods Max are the only headphones l've found that both look good on me and actually sound good with best in class NC and Transparency mode. Also the Apple Watch ultra is something I couldn't live without, I hated Apple Watch before the ultra came out due to battery, but the battery life and water resistance as well as (in my opinion) best interface on a smart watch is just great for me.

Even with all this though I still want to switch, from people with experience of just the S22/23 ultra or of both Apple and Samsung, could you give me some suggestions on how to make the transition easier or benefits of doing so. I know I could still use my AirPods Max but does anyone have any problems using them with android? Same with the watch 5 pro. How does it compare to the ultra? I've watched countless videos on the matter but I always find that YouTubers perspectives are a little biased and usually not as extensive as a full time user of the products.

Finally got my Book 3 Ultra! Some performance notes.,2,11exmt3,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11exmt3/finally_got_my_book_3_ultra_some_performance_notes/,9,"I put together my thoughts so far here since I did not see much about the performance and battery life online yet. The laptop has been pretty decent to use, I was looking for a laptop that can handle a decent bit of gaming but also has a good battery life and is portable, this seems to work so far.

## Build Quality / Overall thoughts

Personally, I feel the build quality is good. I noticed a bit of screen wobble and the screen is super reflective. Having a numpad felt a bit weird in terms of positioning my hands. This is the first time I have thought that a trackpad can be ""too big"", I felt the keyboard was so far away sometimes, lol. The keys are also a bit shallow. But I did find myself getting used to these quirks over time.

## Performance

I was a bit disappointed to hear the fans running loud when playing a game or when running benchmarks but the game performance was not even close to what I was expecting from a 4070 (even though it runs at such a low wattage). That was until I switched on the High Performance mode in ""Samsung Settings"" app (it was already in high performance mode in windows battery settings), the performance was so much better after that! I only tested Dota 2 so far, I went from \~55-60 FPS to 100+ FPS with max settings in native resolution. Time Spy scores: [https://imgur.com/a/iY7Z7xB](https://imgur.com/a/iY7Z7xB)

## Battery Life

I have been playing with the laptop just for a few hours now, so I do not have any solid numbers. I saw \~35% decrease in battery when using it for 2 hours at half screen brightness, on the Quiet performance preset in Samsung Settings, adaptive refresh rate enabled, a second screen connected via SuperDisplay, have 15-20 chrome tabs open and playing videos constantly. I would estimate the battery life to be around 5.5 to 8 hours for medium to light use.

## Pros, Cons and Final Thoughts

* Pros
   * Display. Can't think of a better looking display, OLED looks so beautiful and 120 Hz looks plenty smooth
   * Form Factor. Pretty light for a (3.95lb/1.8kg) for a 16 inch laptop and pretty thin as well
   * Performance. I would list this as a Pro if I am not considering the price, the laptop is plenty capable, but a proper gaming laptop would have a way better performance (probably at the cost of battery life and/or good form factor)
* Cons
   * Price. The 'i9 processor' and 'RTX 4070' seems to be contributing more to the price than the performance imo.
   * Keyboard. The lack of a good key travel, the number pad making the overall layout awkward, the weirdly positioned arrow keys do leave quite a bit of room for improvement in this area.
   * Speakers. Really? Bottom facing speakers in 2023 on a $3k laptop? Having such a nice display makes this even more painful for me personally. But overall not too bad.

The screen just might be what makes me keeps this laptop. Let me know if you like to know something about the laptop or if there are things you want me to run on this laptop.",1677656169.0

Samsung Galaxy S23+ Touch Sensitivity.,0,11f16pr,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11f16pr/samsung_galaxy_s23_touch_sensitivity/,37,"Hey all.

I just got my Samsung Galaxy S23+ a couple of days ago coming from a OnePlus 6T. I put a Spigen glass screen protector on it the moment I took it out of the box before turning it on. This is the first Samsung phone I've had since the Galaxy S6.

And something is really killing the experience for me. The touch sensitivity. It feels so unresponsive. I find that swiping left and right feels slow and swiping up and down feels like it's dragging. The OnePlus felt so fluid and smooth but this takes a lot of effort to scroll having to put much more pressure and drag further to make it move. Even then sometimes it barely scrolls and sometimes misses my touch at all. It seems so inconsistent. And I've turned on the setting for increased sensitivity for screen protectors. 

Is anyone else noticing this or just me? It feels awful and honestly I'm thinking of sending it back and getting a new OnePlus. It just ruins the experience.

Also the settings are a mess in comparison. So many things I've had to search the internet to find because of it and some things just seem not as good. The OP has much more customization for a start. And a lot of things in OneUI feels counter intuitive.

Does anyone know if the notification tone and SMS tone can be separate? If so I haven't found it. I prefer the app and SMS tone to have separate sounds? Does anyone know if it can be done? It's stupid if not. No custom accent colours either which is stupid, just basic ones. On OP I could customise it at an RGB colour code level.

Also does anyone know if the auto play for videos can be turned off for the gallery?

Thank you all for reading and thank you in advance for comments and assistance. My main thing here that's driving me mad is the sensitivity and responsiveness.

Edit: so to all the folks suggesting it's likely the screen protector, I removed it and tried using the phone without it. No noticeable difference. OneUI just feels clunky compared to what I'm used to and the fingerprint scanner never recognises mine first time despite re-registering it. Unless I press down harder than I'm used to and a good amount of pressure at that. I guess I'm quite unhappy with the Samsung which feels overpriced for the experience.",1677669460.0

Is the S23 Ultra seriously that much more scratch prone than past devices (like the S22U)? Never have used a screen protector before.,2,11end2f,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11end2f/is_the_s23_ultra_seriously_that_much_more_scratch/,26,"I've been using smartphones since the original G1 and I've never used a screen protector. No cracks from drops, and no unreasonable scratches other than the micro scratches accumulated from general use. I'm looking at my S9+ that I used for like 4 years with no protector and it looks fine to me still. Little cuts here and there, nothing that I'd actually notice in general use.

Now I'm hearing that the S23U is so incredibly scratch prone that a screen protector is mandatory? Is it *really*? Like I understand micro scratches, they happen over time and it's whatever, but people are making this sound like something new. Like the Scratchpocalypse.

I like cases, always use one, but screen protectors always struck me as a hassle, and I'm having a hard time finding one I can use with the case I've already ordered. Whichever one I check it's either the thing bubbles a lot, doesn't work with cases, or ruins the fingerprint sensor (which I use a lot). I'd be willing to pay a lot for a perfect screen protector, but it doesn't seem to exist, so I'm rapidly leaning into skipping it altogether.

Basically, I'm asking if just using this thing without a protector will eventually result in a nigh unusable screen, or if we're just talking about the sort of thing that would bother a person examining the screen from the right angle with some light and a microscope?

For the uninitiated, 'Over the Horizon' is the Samsung Galaxy theme song. The first version was released with the Galaxy S2 in 2011. Every year Samsung refreshes the song and bundles it with their Galaxy devices from that year.

These are sourced from the original files that are shipped with the devices. However, I have modified the file names and tags to correct some mistakes and keep everything consistent.

Note that I have converted non-MP3 files to MP3 so that all the files can be easily opened and used.

I’m an Apple and iPhone guy, and I love my AirPods. Wife won’t switch, she loves Android, and she just upgraded to the S22. Problem is… no headphone jack! So, for her birthday, I got her a pair of the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. I think that’s how they’re called. 

I’m not really looking for comparisons like which is better. She’ll never use my AirPods with her Samsung (I don’t think you can…) and I won’t use her Buds with my iPhone. I did note they have Active Noise Canceling which I love. 

What I’m wondering… for anyone who’s used both, how are the Buds, and what cool stuff can they do that AirPods can’t, or don’t do as well?

Also, if you wanna roast the Apple guy, I’ll give you a pass since I’m in your house. I can take it. :)",1677599123.0

Samsung S23 Ultra 8GB RAM vs 12GB RAM,17,11e2drg,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11e2drg/samsung_s23_ultra_8gb_ram_vs_12gb_ram/,34," 

Hi guys,

I want to buy a Samsung S23 Ultra but only the 8GB RAM variant is in stock where I live. I don't really game on my phone, just scroll a lot of Youtube and maybe some movies on Plex, but have a lot of tabs opened in Chrome (not sure if those take up a lot of RAM, while they're not displayed).

So I don't think i'm an extreme power user.

The 256 GB storage seems more than enough for my needs, I have the same on my current phone and I've never had the need to clean the space even once in 4 years.

My question is this:

Is 8 GB still okay to get as the 256 is exactly what I want, or should I wait for the 12GB RAM variants to be back in stock?

Is RAM much more important in 2023?

&#x200B;

I don't mind to have only 2-3 apps in memory before they close, what I don't want, is for the phone not not be as snappy next year, because of the lack of RAM.

Thanks!",1677578632.0

The truth (literally!) no one tells you about Android vs iOS updates,175,11dkmpz,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dkmpz/the_truth_literally_no_one_tells_you_about/,89,"I was not sure where to post this observation, but since I love Samsung's version of Android, I would like to leave it there for people who are interested.  


Switcher here. I was an iPhone user for more than 10 years but in 2022 I switched to Samsung for a second time. Partly because of being impressed by an old Samsung phone from 2012. You will probably not believe but it still goes to Internet, uses latest Chrome version (or any browser of your choice) and even installs most apps from Google Play. And it is on KitKat 4.4. I mean, it is the same age as the iPhone 5 that already cannot open any webpage on it's old iOS 10 and install any app (maximum that could have been installed, original was iOS 6 that is the same age as Android 4)  


Generally, one of the major reasons I switched was being tired of constant updates.   
Often I see people on the web and on Reddit particularly writing that ""no Android manufacturer has such software support as Apple"". As an ""Apple veteran"" I have went through 13 major updates on different devices (iPad 1, iPad Air 2, iPhone 4, 5, 6s, 11 Pro). And the way they serve the update didn't change throughout the years: Apple literally downloads it to your device without your consent when you plug the phone on charger and wifi, then out of the blue (often when you are very busy and do not have time for that) they ask ""Install update now or at night"", and you can only postpone it by clicking ""at night"". Then you can delete it from storage but every time a newer version comes out ( for example 15.0.1, 16.1.3 etc) it will download again.  


Most people will just hit ""install"" and it will download. It is a hit-or-miss, but usually every update is a slowdown comparing to the original version. Users often face bugs with every single update. And there is no way back, you cannot revert to the original version if you don't like the one that you had installed.  


Sure thing, updates bring security, better experience, blah blah blah and also bring users to the store in search of a new phone. It is a simple psychological trick everyone knows at Apple, and considering how hard it is to get free of the ""ecosystem"", users usually rush to get a newer iPhone.  


But what if you just do not update on iPhone or iPad? First two years it is going to be OK. After that time sites usually start to lag and not open pages correctly, or the load time increases significantly. This is especially a problem of all banking apps due to them constantly updating all the site code. In the same time, this issue DOES NOT EXIST ON ANDROID. Yes, you get me right: iOS update means everything. If you do not update, you are out. Because all the browsers on iOS are based on Safari's WebKit, so literally if you download Chrome it will change nothing except the skin, sites won't open and there are gonna be even more slowdowns. After 3 years developers usually drop support for older iOS versions and require newer ones. And 3 years literally means 3 major iOS versions, thus people on iOS13 cannot get most new apps and app versions on their devices unless they update or buy a new iPhone if their ones does not support the update.  


In fact, you are in Matrix and are provided with ""two pills"": have a slow but up-to-date iPhone or have a fast but unsupported one.

On the other hand, on Android you can install any modern app (and browser) even as it turns out, on 4.4 KitKat which is the similar age as the iOS 5.1.1 that is installed on my mentioned above iPad 1.   


In fact, getting no update on Android phone does not mean you will have problems with apps and services. It just means that you don't get newer OS features and have a less secure phone. But if you know at least something in tech, does it even make sense? Modern Android is already dummy-proof enough not to allow the install from untrusted sources, as well as you won't probably get anything if you use up-to-date browser (which you do).  


In comparison, how does it feel to have constant updates on Apple? You basically become a beta tester for anything Apple wants to install on your phone. You have to deal with lags, bugs, slowdowns and incompatibility issues. And you cannot ""roll back to original app version"" like on Android or just re-flash the original OS unless you have SHSH blobs (you surely won't have those at the moment you already updated). And in the end you have to buy a new phone because yours does not work as you wish it to. Also you cannot just go and install old app ""apk"" (.ipa in iOS) from web, because ""security"" and copyright, unless you saved the ones tied to your Apple ID on your PC or Mac.  


I have lots of examples of how updates killed my iDevices, but will tell you only the recent one. Since 2014 I was effectively making music on my iPad. I had even bought official Apple lightning to usb adapter to be able to connect my midi keyboard. After I installed the iOS 15 update which I didn't want to do but had to (one of the apps stopped updating) the midi protocol stopped working, synth does not connect and GarageBand and similar apps freeze when it tries to connect and... nothing in the end. Like, WTF. I was making music and suddenly cannot. And you know what is the worst? I cannot go back and this device is now called ""obsolete"", so it does not get any updates or patches except some security ones that do not fix such issues. Now my only choice is to buy a newer iPad and HOPE the problem is fixed already, yet I am sure it is not and the device itself is not worth it.  


So next time you see ANYONE bragging that Android has no updates, show them my post and see their reaction. Because personally I would rather get no system updates than all these untested, poorly optimised and useless yearly updates like it is on Apple devices.

How I Got A Factory Unlocked S23 Ultra for $306,1,11emhlm,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11emhlm/how_i_got_a_factory_unlocked_s23_ultra_for_306/,5,"First off, I always buy my phones outright, factory unlocked so they don't have specific carrier branding or carrier bloatware.  I then use them with a good reputable MVNO for about half the monthly cost of a service plan from a major carrier with the only downside being slower speed when you're around thousands of other people like in a stadium.

The carriers entice people with shiny new objects with gazillion dollars off deals because (a) they know the majority of consumers can't afford to buy the phone outright and (b) they make the big discount a monthly credit spread over 24-36 months so unless you have 3 or 4 lines with the carrier, you will be paying out the nose for the service which is where they make their profit so they can afford to give you low payments on the phone.  Try to leave before the 24-36 months and you have to give the phone back or pay it off and lose the remaining credits from the discount.

Google Fi and Spectrum have the best deals. Google Fi is more straight forward though. $600 off the phone at purchase and you just have to stay with them 120 days (Google Fi is a T-Mobile MVNO and also uses US Cellular Towers when it makes sense.)  Spectrum is convoluted about getting your money back (there's debate whether it's a service credit that they'll refund the unused portion of if you leave them after 60 days or a Visa Cash card 2 months later or whatever. and you'll get a Spectrum branded phone.

At Samsung Store, the pre-order deal cost with trading in my Note 20 Ultra was $807 including a $46 additional educational discount which pretty much anyone can get. Pass. (Almost forgot, they also threw in for Note 20 trades a free watch that you could net about $125 for on Ebay, so technically net would have been around $680.)

Google Fi, the phone was an instant $600 off or $599 ($649 with tax) 512GB model.  The monthly plan is, with a coupon for a $20 credit, a total of $60 more over the minimum 4 months than the comparable US Mobile plan I use.  So that's a total cost of $709.  The big catch is my Note 20 Ultra is mint condition. Sold it for $483.33 on Ebay.  Net after Ebay fees and shipping cost is $403.  So the net cost on upgrading to the S23 Ultra is $306.  And the best thing is I'm not stuck with a specific carrier branded phone (so it will have better resale value) and don't have to pay for a $40-$70 overpriced plan at Verizon, T-mobile, or AT&T for 2-3 years (I use no more than 10GB a month so a $20 15GB plan for a Verizon MVNO suits me great. Coverage is the same, speeds always adequate(even \*real\* high-speed 5G supported not basically relabeled 4G LTE speed all the time) and great customer service.)",1677624352.0
Galaxy S10+ vs A52s 5G in 2023,3,11edfeh,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11edfeh/galaxy_s10_vs_a52s_5g_in_2023/,7," Hey guys

I own a Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro since 2020. This phone was great in Performance and especially battery life, but unfortunately i've been having really bad ghost touch issues with it since 1.5 years ago with other issues as well. With that said I'm trying to avoid Xiaomi entirely.

I kept looking for a another midrange phone. Galaxy A73 was too expensive where I live (510$), and I heard about Performance issues about the A53 so it didn't really convince me.

I decided in the end to pick the A52s 5G, only to be given a used galaxy S10+ (exynos) as a gift recently. I like the S10+'s screen and Build material and also it's quite fast. But I tested its battery capacity with AccuBattery and it gave me 85% (3500 mAh) so I'm having doubts about its longevity.

I'm currently deciding whether I should stick with the Galaxy s10+ (exynos) ? Or Sell it and buy the A52s 5G ? I don't really care about updates unless they actually correct big issues with the OS, and I mainly use my phone to watch Youtube, take notes and take calls. And I could really use a good battery life like the note 9 Pro's and a bright screen outdoors especially when I'm traveling.

What do you guys think is the best decision ?",1677602870.0

The S22 Ultra only has minor cosmetic damage. The reason for the trade-in is my battery is terrible for some reason; it doesn't last a work day. 

I got the S23 Ultra and sent in my S22 U. About a week later, I receive an email from Samsung that the S22 U was ineligible for full credit because the body or screen was cracked. Knowing the device was in very good condition when I sent it to them, I opted to have them return it instead of accepting $150 or so in credit for the device. 

After I chose to have it returned, I called Samsung's customer service to find out if there would be any options available to me if the phone does come back to me cracked or otherwise damaged and all I had for proof was my story vs theirs. The customer rep was super helpful. Apparently they make video recordings for their ""triage reports"" (or something) so he was able to find video evidence that my phone was not damaged. That was a relief. He offered me a $50 code to be emailed to me for all the trouble; the email never arrived. 

A few days later, I receive my S22 U and it's in the same condition I sent it out. Except! Samsung took my S Pen. I am sorry I did not make any video recordings of the device I was going to trade in.

Astro mode has some loose ends,5,11dyfgc,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dyfgc/astro_mode_has_some_loose_ends/,3,"So I've been using the astro mode the last couple days and it is awesome, but of course, some things could be improved (or maybe i'm using it wrong?;


-S-pen shutter in Expert Raw. I know using a 2sec timer works too, but it's not the same.

-Screen preview i think it's called in real cameras. 
Where if you're busy focusing, the screen will completely zoom in on a tiny part of your live screen preview so you can check the focus.

Usually things are very dark in your preview while astro shooting, so it helps being able to pick a random star and use that to focus on. 
Because of the lens switching i assume it's a fruitless effort to actually zoom in and focus. And then zoom back out. 

Focus peaking is nice but I'd rather preview it myself. Moon shots already prompt this same sort of preview when stabilising at 100x (in the camera app, not expert raw).


-The constellation overlay is cool but every time i've used it, it was off a fair bit. And when i saw some galaxy i could potentially zoom in on (i know) like M44 or something.. that's when i remember finding it while zooming in is going to be hell.


-The 4/7/10 min exposure feature may be broken. Not sure what happens but instead of one 7min exposure, tonight i notificed it gave me two 3,5min exposures. So 2 raw files and 2 jpegs. I do remember it's not the first time I've heard this.

Also took a 10min exposure and as far as exif data goes, that shot doesn't exist. 

Could all be due to built-in overexposure protection or something like it, but maybe it's actually buggy. 

Hope Samsung reads this! Awesome phone. Swiss army knife of phones.",1677563774.0
Fraudulent and no responsibility taken. Beyond disappointed and shocked.,8,11dukox,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dukox/fraudulent_and_no_responsibility_taken_beyond/,29,"Hi people,

I've posted this on Samsung Forums but just wanted to share my experience here.

So I've been buying from Samsung since the s4 line years and years ago. However, this is the first time I purchased from the official site. I bought the s23 during pre-order and used the trade-in program, but what happened over 2-3 weeks has completely made me lose faith and trust in Samsung. I will never buy a phone from them again.

I ordered the s23 ultra 512gb in cream with some phone accessories from the e-voucher. **AU230202-38617344** was my order number and I was stoked to see what Samsung had to offer. When I received it, turns out the side of the phone became a little scuffed and I asked for an exchange. The agent was kind enough and assured me the replacement process has been arranged. All I had to do is wait for the return label to be emailed and send it in. 

Now I don't know why a return label took almost a week to be sent, but It did on an afternoon and I sent it in as swiftly as I could. Both the s23 ultra and the a52s was mailed off, and I kept the tracking numbers.

The week after on a Wednesday, I got an email saying the refund has been completed. ??? I realized there must've been a mistake somewhere and contacted Samsung's live chat pronto. I asked for a replacement, not a refund, and the agent before also reassured me. The agent this time investigated the situation and acknowledged that they can see the refund request was clear, but their back offices marked it as 'lost in transit' and subsequently refunded me for it. Keep in mind both the phones showed up as 'delivered' on my AusPost tracking. 

I have asked multiple times for assistance, over live chat and live call, but none of the representatives had the authority to actually do anything about it, since the order is now ""complete"". They sent my case over to their 'VOC', whatever that is, and a week later today there is still no contact. 

I'm just beyond distressed and disappointed at this moment. I've lost 2 phones, 2-3 weeks of my time, and work opportunities. Such a big company and they had nothing to offer - no direct contact with their higher-ups, no ramification, and no adequate processes and quality checks in place to prevent incidents like this. I'd buy it again but, I am not paying $2,2k\~ to cover their mistakes and negligence when I paid $1569 rightfully during the pre-order. Samsung couldn't even offer me a voucher code to let me buy it again.

I don't even have a phone to use now, and it's thanks to me believing in Samsung in the first place. Again, I just have no words for Samsung's appalling processes and their negligence to customers. I don't want to ever buy from Samsung again, and this is just the experience I wanted to share.

So has anyone actually experienced subpar customer service and order negligence like this?? I'd be keen to hear people's thoughts. I'm also planning to buy the iPhone 15 ultra. Seriously screw Samsung. They also need to give me my crappy a52s back.

Thanks.

**UPDATE:** 

I received a call today, 3rd of Feb at 12:22PM. I assume it was from one of the many follow ups the Samsung reps raised for me. THE AGENTs MESSED IT UP AGAIN. 

He said, ""regarding the refund request raised for your phone, we just want to confirm if you have received it? Yes? Okay thank you!"" 👁️👄👁️ I intervened and complained that yes, I received the refund but that was not the point of this case at all. I NEVER specifically asked for the refund and only ever wanted AN EXCHANGE. So he ""changed his notes"" and said ""someone will be in contact with you asap"". No estimated date.",1677551861.0

I was an Apple user since the iPhone 4, which was a great time and a lot of innovation on Apple's part. However, since the iPhone XR and IOS 12, it felt the same for me every year. 1.5 years ago, I was pulled into buying a new 13 Pro, but I wasn't just excited anymore. I wanted something new. First I tried the Z Flip 4, but returned it because of the narrow screen (it's so narrow!). 

When I saw that the s23 Ultra came out, I was really tempted. I bought the new phone and gifted my 13 Pro to my girlfriend who doesn't really care about phones at all, lol. 

I'm using it now for a couple of days and I can say I'm in love. The notification system was weird for me in the beginning, but now I wonder how I could ever like the notification system on IOS. It's so fast and intuitive, you can directly answer in the notifications, you can scroll in widgets. I love watching movies on YouTube and Netflix. I can customize stuff how I want. It has great night shots, that I took last weekend are way better than on iPhone (to me at least, everyone has different taste).

Apple’s iPhones Winning Over Gen Z—and the World’s Premium Market,56,11dcdcf,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dcdcf/apples_iphones_winning_over_gen_zand_the_worlds/,226,"The Wall Street Journal

Trend puts pressure on rival Samsung, maker of high-end Android smartphones

SEOUL—Consumers around the world are increasingly choosing  Apple Inc.’s iPhones over high-end Android smartphones, with younger users seen as pushing the company toward the level of dominance in the market globally that it has enjoyed in the U.S.

From Europe to Asia, Apple’s market lead in the premium bracket  is growing, and polls show that people in their teens and early 20s,  known as Gen Z, increasingly see the iPhone as a must-have. Converts say  they are drawn by its design, cameras and AirDrop features for sharing  photos.

The trend is putting Apple’s chief rival, Samsung Electronics Co., under pressure and threatening the South Korean  company’s lead in the overall global smartphone market. Samsung has been  promoting its splashy foldable phones and 100x zoom cameras on the latest Galaxy S23 Ultra that brought a “wow” from Elon Musk on Twitter.

In Samsung’s backyard, where the brand’s Android smartphones have held sway, Apple’s clout has been growing since the company opened its first store in South Korea  in 2018. Apple now has four stores in the country, where its  mobile-payment system Apple Pay will soon become available for the first  time.

Around 52% of people age 18 to 29 in South Korea were using an  Apple smartphone as of 2022, up from 44% two years earlier, according to  polls by Gallup Korea. Samsung’s share of this age group slipped to 44%  from 45% in that time, the polls showed. For all older age groups,  Samsung phones remain most prevalent.

Chung Kyung-rim, a 22-year-old college student in Seoul, said nearly  all of her peers use an iPhone. Apple’s reputation for prettier designs  and good photos has stuck through the years, she said, though she thinks  Samsung’s devices have improved in looks and likes the diverse colors of Samsung’s latest flip phones, she said.

Apple’s rise among young people will likely help the U.S.  firm’s position in the high-end phone business that it has been leading.  Apple’s share of worldwide shipments of smartphones priced at $800 and  above grew to 76% last year from 65% in 2018, while Samsung’s declined  to 17% from 27%, according to Canalys, a tech-market researcher. China  has been one major driver of growth for Apple after U.S. sanctions crippled another rival, Huawei Technologies Co.

Samsung remains the world’s largest smartphone maker by overall  shipments, a title it has held since 2012. Even here, Apple is closing  in on its rival. Samsung’s market share has held roughly steady at  around 21% for the past five years, according to Canalys, while Apple’s  share climbed to 19% in 2022 from 15% in 2018.

High-end smartphones are critical for phone makers as they  bring in the biggest profits and showcase technological capabilities and  leadership, said Tom Kang, a Seoul-based director at Counterpoint  Research.

The pricier phone segment also represents a pocket of resilience in  an industry that has been sliding. Last year, global shipments of  smartphones priced above $800 grew 1%, while overall shipments of  smartphones fell 12%, according to Canalys.

A Samsung spokesman noted that preorder volumes for the recently launched Galaxy S23 smartphone series were higher than for the prior year’s models, with 60% of consumers choosing the most-expensive Galaxy S23 Ultra.

Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.

In the U.S., where Apple accounted for 77% of the  premium-smartphone market last year according to Canalys, one reason for  the popularity of iPhones among young people has been the prevalence of  iMessage, Apple’s messaging app that is widely used and designates different colors for iPhone users and Android users.

Elsewhere in the world that is seen as less of an edge because third-party mobile messengers are more mainstream, from WhatsApp in Europe to KakaoTalk in South Korea.

Young people around the world say they are attracted by  Apple-exclusive features such as AirDrop, which enables easy sharing  between iPhones between friends, and preferences for Apple’s photography  and design.

For years, Apple’s marketing has focused on taking cinematic photos and videos.

Today’s top-end iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smartphone both have  similar camera components and excel at capturing quality high-resolution  photos, said Choi Kab-soo, a travel photographer living in Seoul who  runs smartphone-photography classes.

Some differences in the color expression of the photos might  make people feel that Apple’s phones take better photos in everyday  settings, said Mr. Choi, who uses an iPhone.

Sarah Carrivale, a 24-year-old graduate student living in  Paris, has noticed that more people around her age are using  iPhones—around 7 in 10 she estimates.

She switched to an iPhone 12 two years ago, after using a  string of Android devices including ones from Samsung and a Chinese  brand. After taking a while to get used to the iPhone, she said she is  satisfied with its durability, ease of navigation and cameras.

“Once you get an iPhone, in a way there’s no turning back,” Ms. Carrivale said.

Across Western Europe, Android users under the age of 25 were  almost three times more likely to prefer Apple for their next smartphone  than older age groups, according to a poll last year by Canalys of  4,000 individuals from the U.K., Germany, Spain and Italy. Apple users  under 25 were more than twice as likely as Android users of the same age  to stick with their respective operating systems, the poll showed.

Apps on an iPhone feel faster and more glitch-free, even if the  specs are similar to an Android device, said Nicholas Leonzi, a  26-year-old retail worker in London. He tried out a Samsung Galaxy S21  Ultra in 2021, which had “cool” features  like charging his Galaxy Buds Pro earphones on the back of the phone. A  regular phone upgrader, he reverted back to Apple after a year and is using the latest version of the AirPods Pro.

Apple has also grown by building its products based on the same  operating system, helping strengthen user retention and brand loyalty.  Android smartphones have far more players in the mix because it isn’t a  closed operating system like Apple’s.

“As younger consumers grow stickier to the Apple ecosystem, it’ll become harder for Samsung to compete with Apple,” said                       Nicole Peng,          a Canalys senior vice president.

Samsung, which leads the Android segment, is working to catch up  by focusing efforts on making its products from smartphones to TVs to  appliances, and those of partner brands, work together in the most  hassle-free manner possible.

One bright spot for Samsung is that it is leading the foldable-smartphones category  it helped pioneer. Sales of foldable phones represent less than 1% of  the smartphones shipped worldwide today, but their increased popularity  could boost Samsung’s future position in the premium category, analysts  say. Apple has yet to announce any plans for foldable phones.

Lee Hye-jin, whose high-school-age daughter and son have owned  iPhones since middle school in Seoul, highlighted the iPhone’s appeal to  younger generations. She estimated that 7 out of 10 of her children’s  classmates are iPhone users.

“They say it’s more ‘hip’ to use Apple,” she said.",1677505999.0
"Calling all Routine users: Is there any way to have phone charge if battery is below a certain % only, and not stop until it hits the Protect Battery (85%)",3,11dxscn,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dxscn/calling_all_routine_users_is_there_any_way_to/,19," 

I hate that Protect Battery puts the phone back on charge as soon as it drops to 84% after reaching 85%, the defined protect battery threshold.

Got a routine set up for the daytime to enable Battery Protect if placed on a charger during certain hours (11am - 3am). I'll never need 100% charge after a certain time, so getting to 85% is fine after 11am.

What I'm trying to do now is set up 2 routines.

**Routine 1** is simple: enable Protect Battery during certain hours (11am - 3am).

Routine 2 - I don't think I can do it, but maybe I'm missing something obvious? I've written how I want it to work:

**Routine 2 - Check if phone battery is low enough to charge**

* If phone placed on a wireless charger, check battery level  

   * If battery level above / = X (say 65%), then  

      * Don't charge
   * If battery level below X (say 65%)  

      * Charge (phone will charge to 85% due to Protect Battery = True)
   * If battery level ***drops*** below X  

      * Charge (phone will charge to 85% due to Protect Battery = True)

The idea - when wireless charging: to have the phone NOT charge to 85%, stop, fall to 84%, start charging to 85%.... repeat cycle...

Instead, I'd like to charge to 85%, then not have the phone charge again until it falls below 65%. It sounds super simple so I'm convinced I'm just being stupid.",1677561654.0

&#x200B;

Basically, it's the title. I'm closing in on a upgrade for my current phone (It's currently the S21 5G model) and I'm going to be sticking with Samsung going forward. Nothing but positives about my current phone with the only issue being the charging port currently is very buggy. As in, only charges at certain angles and sometimes it just disconnects the charger (I believe it might just be the charging port not holding the charger cable in right is all, but easy to get around).

&#x200B;

I was looking at the Z Flip 4 due to the size when shut is a big positive, my current job means having a large phone in my pocket will increase the chances of accidental presses and damage to the screen, my current screen protector that has been fantastic from getting the phone nearly 2 years ago, (I got a fantastic deal on the newest release due to how long the account has been on the provider).

&#x200B;

I've watched some YouTube videos, but the issue I've found is a lot of the big 'TechTubers' tend to focus fully on the positives, be it personal preference or if they don't want to upset Samsung I don't know, but I know the original model and the Z Flip 2 had several issues which I thought I'd ask before going for the plunge.

&#x200B;

Have they sorted out the issue the hinge had with it failing fast in daily use?

Has the battery life been improved? I work 12 hour shifts and while I'm not on my phone the entire 12 hours, I saw several people complaining even in rest mode the battery drained fast.

How is the front screen in terms of usefulness? It's not one that needs any sort of squinting to see in darker lights is it?

How is the build quality on it? Samsung phones in my experience have been really well built and can take a bit of a beating, not saying I'm going to be throwing the phone at the wall, but there will be times a box may hit it, will it hold up with a case?

&#x200B;

I won't be upgrading until April so I also don't know if they are going to be releasing a Z Flip 5 soon, which is another question actually.

S23 Ultra terrible battery!,0,11eeutk,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11eeutk/s23_ultra_terrible_battery/,70,"I have had my S23 Ultra for a few weeks now and the battery life is absolutely nothing short of abysmal. I can only get a maximum of 4hrs of SOT, which is ridiculous for this flagship given the price I paid and that others are getting 8-9-10hrs SOT. It drains 1% for like every few minutes of usage.

I previously used Smart Switch to transfer from my S21+ and after reading that it can potentially cause battery drain I factory reset the phone. Nothing changed. Here are my settings:

- 120hz WQHD+
- Mix of WiFi 6 and LTE 4G (no 5g, good signal in my area)
- Brightness around 40%
- Bluetooth on (Galaxy Watch 4)
- Protect Battery (only charge to 85%)

I have a Bixby Routine set up to turn off wifi, mobile data, bluetooth and turn on airplane mode and battery saver, yet it still drains like 4-5% overnight. I can't imagine how much it will drain without that... I am 100% confident I have NO rogue apps draining my battery.

Coming from an s21+ (was getting 2h SOT, the only reason I upgraded was the battery life...) this feels like I got scammed by Samsung yet again. Do I have the shittiest luck in the universe or is samsung fundamentally bad? 

I apologize for the long rant and I'd really like some insight here because I am understandably pissed off when others are getting such crazy battery life.

[Serious] Notification icons need to be different colors,65,11d4lut,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11d4lut/serious_notification_icons_need_to_be_different/,22,"There was recently an update that went out that changed all of the notifications on my phone to be the same color.

For example, these are the old notifications: [here](https://i.imgur.com/POtNLB9.jpg).

And these are the [new ones](https://i.imgur.com/kE4FDW0.jpg)

Before, it was easy to scan down the list as a whole, pausing my eyes only on the color of the text. Familiarity of what's usually in that list (lets face it, we don't always clear *all* of our notifications) contrasts nicely with what's new to the list, especially when there are so many items I need to scroll down to see all of them. I'm able to memorize its contents with less effort. It was much easier to use. 

On the new color scheme, my old habits of scanning are obsolete. I'm having a difficult time. I've been trying to scan down the left side only to see what app it is, then I read the notification itself. It's a lot to take in. The only way to tell apps apart is a basic shape inside that purple bubble and my vision isn't what it used to be on these high density phone displays.  

I really don't like the change. You probably could have guessed that by now. If this was an A-B test, please dial me down. If this is the new default setting, please reconsider. If there's an easy way to get the colored title text back, even better. But I will still be peaved that it just changed to this without my consent. I still use old reddit for goodness sake.

If you're looking for a better solution, may I suggest slightly tinting the notification bars themself with the app default color. Nothing wrong with a little more variation of color in our lives. You can keep it subtle yet maintained the readability. 

TLDR: my phone is harder to use because of the new UI design",1677478620.0
S23 Ultra Case options,3,11dpe5t,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dpe5t/s23_ultra_case_options/,5,"I havent been in the market for a case in a long time, but after ordering the S23 Ultra, I think I need to change that.

The side question I have is MAGSAFE. Is it worth it? I havent looked into it before but I see quite a few cases with it, or the HALO from ESR. Any experience? Normally I just have a metal plate between my phone and case, but the change might be welcome, even after buying a bunch of accessories to make it worth my time. Any experience on that specifically is very welcome.

I see a LOT of clear cases available, but Im afraid of them being gross or nasty after a while of use, with yellowing color, scratches, and dust and grime getting in and being clearly visible.. has anyone had similar problems? Should this not be an active concern?

I would love a ""do all case"" but at the same time I dont want or need a tank - Im more interested just because having the ""full enclosure"" is an interesting concept for the outdoors or in general.

Last option Im interested in is protective, but slim. Ive had Pitaka and loved it, Mous and loved it, but looking for other options as well.

Any advice is welcome, just trying to raise some of my own opinions and gain some knowledge!",1677538070.0

Samsung's order processes are so bad they're an active cyber security risk to their customers,0,11dtq2q,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dtq2q/samsungs_order_processes_are_so_bad_theyre_an/,2,"This morning I received an SMS from a cell phone number I'd never seen before telling me my requested Samsung delivery date wasn't available and to click a link to rebook.

Now I have ordered from Samsung and am waiting for a product however, I get tons of delivery notification scams and am wise enough to initiate a chat with support.

Where I'm told not only can they not verify for me that they sent a message but that if I want to set a new requested date I'd need to click the link in the SMS provided.

Given the prominence of phishing scams and cyber crime in 2023 this is totally unacceptable.There's nothing in the message that can be used to verify it's legit and support can't or wont confirm that Samsung sent it and it's legit while telling me the only way to actually get confirmation and book a new date would be to click a link that can't be verified as trusted.**This is a terrifying level of disregard for customer safety.**

So I ask to have my concerns raised in a case and have an email sent to me with some level of follow up at a minimum I'd like to know im actually going to receive the product im paying thousands of dollars for.

This is not an option, Samsungs processes mean that sending me an email to be followed up can't be done.

I own probably somewhere in the ball park of $10,000 worth of Samsung goods and am stunned by the utter indifference to customers digital safety as well as complete in ability to provide clear information on an order.To the extent that I'm no longer going to by future Samsung products and will likely end up cancelling this order ... assuming I ever get a support agent that can help me.  


Edit  
Tl;Dr  


Samsung need to seriously address their behavior and do a far better job of communicating clearly when their customers need to take action to ensure an order is delivered.  


Their current approach is so bad it can only serve to encourage customers to disregard sensible safety practices and place themselves at risk to ensure orders get delivered.",1677549494.0

The phone just feels way more premium. (As it should considering the price difference)

-

**Still there are a few minor things that annoy me:**

* Volume buttons - This actually surprised me because when I first got the pixel I thought the placement was weird but over time it grew on me, It feels more natural now

**OneUi:**

* Folders - They just feel more thought through on the pixel, you can open and select the app you want with one hand instead with OneUi you must either shift the phone or use both hands (There is a setting in homeup on goodlock but the folder opening animation takes forever so it’s not usable in my opinion)
* App Drawer - There is no option to focus the search bar automatically
* App Drawer - No *real* app list (There is a setting on homeup but then you have ""priority apps"" pinned on top which makes the whole thing unusable)
* Quick Panel - The settings and power icons being at the bottom on the pixel makes quickly accessing them so much more convenient

I'm currently awaiting my new S23 Ultra, and one of the most exciting parts of the phone shopping process was my plan to get a Peak Design case for my next phone. I knew I'd be switching, but it wasn't worth the startup cost for my current popsocket attachments until I was already buying a new phone anyway. 

As it turns out, the magnetic attachment system for PeakDesign will disable the most exciting feature of the new phone, that being the stylus. Does anyone know of any other relatively slim and sleek cases that have a full modular system of accessories? The ones that sound most interesting to me are: 

\-Wallet

\-Something to attach a pop socket to

\-Additional battery

\-Additional Storage

\-Additional ports, such as USB-C, ethernet, or HDMI

\-Items like rangefinders

I have been looking around both business and personal solutions providers for a case that may work, but all that I have found have turned out to either rely on magnets, rendering the stylus useless, or not having an option for popsocket/wallet/popwallet (which I currently use), and not having a popsocket or wallet option at all is unfortunately a dealbreaker. 

Really, if I could get a peak design case with no magnets but with access to all of the peak design accessories, I'd be happiest. Does anyone know of other good phone case systems with some modularity?",1677532554.0

EDIT: Not saying this is going to be universally true for everyone obviously as everyone's needs and demands are different. My personal experiences (and no, I don't take pictures of all stats before and after I make settings changes to my devices) with previous models have shown improvements in performance and battery by both being able to turn it off if it's an option (added in One UI 5.0) or tuning it down to lower GB amounts. Because of those previous experiences it was something I turned off first getting my new devices and friends of mine have had similar improvements especially in battery after I recommended they turn it off.

Switch Emulation (3DS and PSP also) is insane on the S23, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and it's GPU has really impressive performance 

Here are 2 gameplay videos I recorded. I just played the game for 20+ minutes while screen recording so towards the end there is thermal throttling with more than 3 characters on the screen. Throughout the 32 minutes of play time it used 5.8% battery.

I was so into the game the 2nd time i accidentally clicked stop and it didn't record but that was the best performance I got too since it was 30 frames the whole time without recording. 

First video I had the wrong audio setting so there is only BGM
https://youtu.be/wX8Jdb0723c

Second video has it all but is after 15 minutes of playing and recording.
https://youtu.be/9GYr0tyq0lA


There are 2 apps that you can choose to use for emulation: 

- EggNS (Paid - need a supporting controller or monthly sub)

- Skyline (Free)

- Skyline Edge (Patreon sub)

Skyline Edge is much more respectable since they built from the ground up using open source code and have been steadily improving game performance at a fast rate. They will at some point I hope overtake EggNS.

EggNS has more support and better frames on most games but that is because they have been around for longer, they began by taking code and profiting off it so they have a bad reputation. 

Personally whatever runs the games better in the end is what I'm going to be using. The EggNS developers have hinted at an iOS release but I'm doubtful it will run well since there are so many restrictions on iOS.

You will then need to follow guides to source your own key files, firmware and game roms. 

Other games I tried on EggNS: 

- Astral Chain 30 fps, it's pretty good but haven't gotten to intense combat yet

- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe starts at 60 fps but it drops to 40 fps

- Super Mario Bros U Deluxe 60 fps whole time

- Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Violet had issues maybe it needs a driver update cause others can run it

- Metroid Prime Remastered 60 fps

Every so often it just stops working. You put it onto a wireless charger and nothing happens, no messages, no acknowledgement that it's even trying to charge. Once this happens, the only way to fix it is a reboot. Once you reboot, it starts wireless charging as normal.

It doesn't stop charging part way through, if you put the phone on the charger it either starts working or nothing!. If it starts charging, it will charge OK until full. So it's not a temperature issue.

We have tried 4 different wireless chargers (a Samsung one, two from Amazon and an in-car one). They all work fine until the phone decides to stop recognising the chargers and then none work.

We have even tried  wireless power sharing from my S23 Ultra - nothing until a reboot.

If we plug in a charging cable, it will start charging OK, but still won't wireless charge.

It can happen at any battery level, we've seen it at 46%, 65%, 85% and 96%.

My S23 ultra uses the same wireless chargers without issue. We still have my wife's S21 and that has never had issues with the same chargers. So I am 100% sure it's not a charger issue.

We are wondering if it's a hardware of software issue. If it's hardware we need to get the phone returned and replaced, if it's a software issue then we can perhaps wait for Samsung to fix it.

You Know That 5Ghz Band Wifi6 issue most S22/S23 Ultras has been having? I may have found a good Temporary Solution for this.,0,11cqe66,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11cqe66/you_know_that_5ghz_band_wifi6_issue_most_s22s23/,12,"So I've been dealing with this for over a year now, trying everything under the sun to get this to work and I noticed that the majority of the time the issue happens with Asus Routers. And ironically I have one too, an RT-AX86U to be exact. 

So after a lot of research & trial and error, I found myself a good Temporary Solution that has been working for over a week now, with the WiFi signal lagging very briefly on a rare occasion, with maybe one time where I thought the issue came back but the whole internet was down instead 😅.

So here's what I did:

1. No Smart Switch was used to set up my S23 Ultra. Never liked it to be honest. I use Samsung Cloud and Google Drive via Google One to back up everything & I keep all my stuff in the cloud so it was only a re-download of what was needed. And I only brought back only my Messages & Call Log, cuz I'm forgetful 😅. I also manually added my WiFi to my phone, I didn't bring it over. I also cleared it from my Known WiFi Networks as well beforehand.

2. I switched the Router's software from ASUSMerlin back to Stock ASUS software, and updated it to the most STABLE version. Get it from ASUS directly & install it via the web gui.

3. I did both the HARD Factory Reset AND the NORMAL Factory Reset after I updated the router. There's two versions of it apparently. I did the version where you are physically pressing buttons to do it, and then I did the normal one on the Web Gui. Look up Hard Factory Reset *insert router name here* and it'll give you the way to do it for that particular version.

4. Went through Initial Router Set-up normally. Kept the same name & password, **stick to WPA2 security, you'll see why in a second**

5. *on the phone* Turned on Developer Settings on the phone, turned on Wifi Safe Mode.

6. Settings, Connections, WiFi, tap on the 3 Dots on the top right and choose Intelligent WiFi & turn off Prioritize Real-time Data.

7. *in Web Gui for the Router* Turn off 802.11ax/WiFi 6 mode. It's in Wireless. Make sure you do it for both bands (the first section will be which band you're editing, choose accordingly)

8. I actually kept on the 160 Mhz option for the 5Ghz because I want my speed dammit. Hasn't affected anything.

9. Switched my DNS (including IPv6) out of Cloudflare to a different DNS, I used Google. IPv4 is in the WAN section, IPv6 is in the IPv6 section (switch only if you actually have that one normally) **I didn't try different DNS options, Google was always my second choice, my focus was NOT using Cloudflare. Try different ones and see, I was always having issues with Cloudflare**

10. **for fun cuz why not** Restart everything. Phone, Router, and Modem if you're feeling fancy. Why? It doesn't hurt so might as well.



That's it. No Phone Mac. No Static IP on the phone. I'm on my 5Ghz Band consistently and it works almost flawlessly. Granted I would love to have Wifi6 available to me so I can get a better router with the 6Ghz Band as an option, but being able to use my 5Ghz in a stable way on my phone when I need that is more important to me. So there we go.",1677440176.0

I bought the monitor last December when the price drop down to $700. But when I tested it, it has some dead pixel. I've ask for replacement. But they said that their tech need to check those first. The tech went this february and replace the parts, but when it was tested. It's much worse than what i have. They told me that they will replace it, but when I received the email. It says they will replace it with refurbished. I did complain about the refurbished and they said that they will replace it with new one.

Samsung TV and Galaxy Buds 2 Pro Range,0,11c5uau,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11c5uau/samsung_tv_and_galaxy_buds_2_pro_range/,6,"Hey. So I have a Samsung qn90a and Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. I love both of them individually but there are a couple things I can't figure out
1. The range with the TV is horrendous. I need to sit like a foot or 2 away from my TV else it starts stuttering. Is there an extender type device I can add to my TV to boost the BT range?

2. I need to manually switch to the buds via the TV remote. I understand that there won't be an auto switch option for my TV(2021 range) but the moment I disconnect my buds the TV defaults back to the TV speaker instead of my default soundbar setup. Is there any way to change this? Maybe a short cut using smart things to switch between Bluetooth and sound bar that I'm overlooking? 

Due to the above reasons I haven't really used my buds often with my TV and that sucks since the sound quality is truly great and I can only use them on my tab and phone.",1677387602.0

Avoid Pixel phones,23,11bhlok,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11bhlok/avoid_pixel_phones/,58,"I've had my pixel 7 for under a month, and I've had to contact customer support on a few things, firstly my 3 months free YouTube premium to which they stated if you have already used any free trial then you cannot use this. I told them I have used a free trial but there's an option for another free month to which I have activated and sent the screenshot stating that isn't the issue. They told me well we can't do anything about it. 

My next issue was the trade in services and how my phone got rejected for screen burns, I sent them the pictures clearly showing there are no burns. They said they have escalated it to the highest tier and their response was because it has been returned we can't do much but here you go a free 40£ gift card. If this is there responses a month into my new phone what will it be when my phone experiences any hardware or software issues. To put it simply I don't trust this brand and i will not purchase a pixel phone anytime in the near future.

I will be switching back to Samsung as it's more reliable, has better stock apps, consistent pictures, quick menu and widgets are inconveniently too large with no added benefit, Google photos and gallery's are light years behind Samsung gallery in terms of customisation, Google keyboard and Microsoft as well. I've had to download a couple of apps because Samsung had irmt stock Google didn't for example Samsung pass, background media player, music player, that's actually good and customisable, Samsung notes, if your screen is off you can't hold to reduce the volume you have to tap it to reduce it or turn the screen on to hold it - I use this alot when I'm sleeping so it's a daily issue but exclusive to me. Not sure why WiFi and data are not separate options and sometimes weirdly turns on WiFi and connects me even though I've had it off, I had to install a new app that allows me to add documents or pictures as a shortcut on the home screen

As for what's good from the pixel: it's smoooth, above average battery life, I like the ss features, when the picture is good it's amazing, DND works amazing - miles ahead of Samsung, others I can't think of as of right now. 

All in all its a great phone but compared to Samsung I definitely have missed a lot of features and the customer service with Samsung is top notch compared to Google and this is why I am making the move, ofcourse backed with the downsides that I have with the phone.",1677319912.0

S23 Ultra Best Camera Setups - Issue with Indoor High Contrast Scenes Though,0,11c2te5,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11c2te5/s23_ultra_best_camera_setups_issue_with_indoor/,0,"Been comparing shots on the Samsung S23 Ultra I just got to my Note 20 Ultra.  As expected, it's not a night and day difference of course.  But in most scenes, the S23 Ultra produces moderately better results with the biggest difference when using Expert Raw in 50MP mode both JPG and RAW output (while the latter is going to be better for post editing.  I imagine 200MP is good too but I'm passing on that large of file size).

I found what I think though is a limitation in the camera software (or sensor).  Hopefully Samsung will fix it in a future update. It is for moderately low light indoor photos (like late afternoon and overcast with no indoor lighting turned on), but where you have a bright scene through the windows (like snowy mountains).  I imagine this happens in any room where you have bright window scene and not a bright room. 

The normal camera on the Note20 Ultra does much better metering and doesn't blow out the scene in the windows.  The S23 Ultra comes very close if using the normal camera in 12MP mode but at best it's equal to the Note in other tests the S23 Ultra totally blew out the window scene where the Note 20 Ultra didn't.  In this test scene it got a little worse in 50MP mode.  Then it gets even worse in Pro mode.  In Expert Raw it is bad too in some circumstances no matter what metering mode you select or exposure setting.  If you are lucky to get a decent shot in Expert Raw you can tweak the RAW output in Adobe lightroom, but it's still not as good as the normal camera mode on both phones! Where as most other shot scenes, the Expert Raw in 50mp mode is superior to the other modes and anything the Note 20 Ultra puts out, but you need to zoom in on the photo to really notice the difference.  (Safe to say if you're a Note 20 Ultra User (or S21/22 Ultra), you're not missing out much as the 200mp sensor in the S23 Ultra is as I expected part modest improvement and part a lot of marketing hype.)

Here's a comparison between normal 12mp camera output on Note 20 and S23 Ultra, then an Adobe Lightroom edited RAW image coming from Expert Raw on the S23 Ultra in 12mp mode.  

So the end conclusion is that in the current state of the software, on the S23 Ultra, for high contrast moderate natural light indoor shots like this, you are best just using the standard 12mp auto mode in the regular camera app. Whereas in most other situations you get the best quality with reasonable file size shooting in Expert Raw at 50mp.

For me and from many reports, this happens on all WiFi 6 networks, at home and at work and outside at the mall. It is not an issue with some particular configuration or router. It is an issue with the S23 Ultra WiFi software/driver and how it handles WiFi 6 networks. It does not seem happen on WiFi 5 or WiFi 6E from the reports and my experience, so switching to either will resolve the issue until Samsung fixes it.

I was on LTE all the time. First I was on a train for about 45min. I wasn't really using my phone all the time maybe for like half of the ride. Then I used my phone for about 35min with 1% brightness and extra dim set to maximum intensity. After that, during the day I was checking some social media etc. with higher brightness and then went back on a train with similar usage. And holy, my battery just got sucked. You might argue that I had poor signal in the train but it was like half of my total usage today and I shouldn't get 2h SoT in any conditions! Beside the train I had a great signal as I was in the city center. How is your battery life after OneUI 5.1? Also, note that I had most of my apps in deep sleep, smart suggestions off, and I followed most of the battery saving tips and tricks besides the Power Saving Mode(I won't give up on 120hz).",1677264805.0
Cancelling order (+Cancelling Trade-In),0,11bsfkb,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11bsfkb/cancelling_order_cancelling_tradein/,7,"So in my other post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11b0fks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11b0fks/)) I was debating keeping the S23 Ultra due to the size.

I decided not to keep it since i just can't get happy with it and have to trust my gut feeling here.

When i purchased, I paid just over £800 including a bunch of discounts and a trade in discount of £290 for my existing phone. (Which i have not yet sent to them)

I spoke to Samsung about returning the S23 Ultra , and they said they would refund me the £800 when i return the phone, and since i would not be sending my S20 to them, would be charged £290 from the trade in team.

I can't get my head around how this would make sense, because in my mind , The £290 discount would only be applicable if i kept the device , but since i'm cancelling altogether, Can't see how that is logical?

Am i getting this wrong?

TLDR : Paid £800 , Got the S23 Ultra , Would have cost me £290 more without a trade in, Didn't send the trade in, Cancelling order, Should be getting £800 back and calling it a day?",1677350956.0

As someone who is constantly trying to capture videos of my cats all day long, P7 Pro was just not a great device. Don't get me wrong, if the lighting was good, videos were decent. But most of my indoor shots had a lot of noise. Evening and night time videos were average at best unless I had got some good lighting setup.

Another issue I had was overheating and battery life, if I was shooting 4k videos, the battery just didn't last as long. Editing videos on the phone wasn't that great either... Tensor's subpar performance really made editing slower and the device would just get hot quickly. I saw that warning multiple times where it would say that the device is too hot to continue shooting and it had barely been 5 mins of 4K 30fps recording.

I came from iPhone 13 Pro before P7 Pro so all of these issues with video recording and performance annoyed me a lot. I didn't want to go back to Apple ecosystem because let's just say that I got bored from iOS and wanted to experience Android again.

I preordered S23 Ultra on the launch day and have had the device for about a week now. I'm really happy with the performance and video quality so far. Although I'm not a professional videographer, I have tried shooting some 8K clips of my cats, and I really like the end result, and even uploaded it to YouTube. I've been able to record 4K 60 fps for longer than 10 mins, and have not really seen any overheating warnings so far. Phone has just gotten warm once when I downloaded like 40GB of data over 5G network in one go.

Video editing feels smoother and a better display with S Pen really helps here with precision. I'm mostly editing for reels/shorts, and I've been very happy with the results so far. Battery life is much better and I charge my device once every day.

Only thing I would say that I miss from Pixel 7 Pro is shutter speed. Samsung is not too bad but I definitely feel the difference and before anyone points out, I've already installed the camera assistant app and turned on the faster shutter setting. But that's just for shutter lag, not shutter speed.

If my cats are moving too much, I am mostly taking a video and not a picture, so the shutter speed factor doesn't bother me as much. S23 Ultra is just a better overall camera experience for me.

I don't do any gaming on my phone so I can't say much about in that area.

Overall, I'm a happy S23 Ultra user.

I know this might sound like a rant, but I hope it doesn’t.  I would just like to provide my personal experience of why I no longer trust Samsung Mobile and then ask for your thoughts.

Both my wife’s watch and mine bricked by a bad firmware update.  Out of warranty and Samsung Philippines initially refused to repair it even though Samsung firmware bricked it!  Had to raise this higher up the food chain to resolve but took weeks.

  

\-	Samsung Fold Screen Reliability

My Fold 3 main screen failed at 18 months old.  Anecdotal evidence from friends on social media seemed to suggest this is common, usually somewhere between 18 months to 24 months.  Some of my friends with Samsung folding screen devices have even had 2 different models and they have had both different models fail in this timeframe.  As it’s outside of warranty Samsung want at least $700 to repair it presumably so it can fail again at some point in the future?

   

This has now left me with 6 Samsung tags that appear to be useless as I’m not likely buying another Samsung phone.

  

Would be interesting to hear in the comments from people who have had any Samsung folding phone for a long period (at least 18 months?) to see how they feel about their reliability.

  

\-	[Samsung S23 Screen Wrinkle](https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-screen-wrinkle) 

(I’ve not suffered this, included as evidence of continued failure)

Although this is still new and no one really knows for sure how many are affected, it’s clearly a defect and the excuse from Samsung is on par with Apples “your holding it wrong”.  This is not a cheap phone and neither is the waterproofing/dustproofing process so, why has it only appear on these new models?  Manufacturing or design defect?  It doesn’t matter how minor it is, it’s still a defect and under UK law (at least when I was at school) a product had to be “free from minor defect” or could be returned.

  

Samsung have cost me well over $2000 in wasted money (lest we not also forget time!) and peripherals I no longer have a use for.  Given this I don’t think I can trust Samsung anymore as either their design, manufacture or QA (or combination) just seem to be failing and these are the issues I’m aware of, I’m guessing there might be more. 

  

How many of you feel like you can still trust Samsung Mobile?

It's sad that Samsung's Exynos processor failed so bad. Especially since my S10, when it was an amazing and powerful SoC.

But Samsung burnt European users with that chip (incapable to keep up with the competition, including system lags) it is questionable whether they will gain back their trust and mine.

I feel Samsung should acquire Qualcomm and let their own failed attempt of making an own chip go.

Rest of the world (RoW) doesn't have any idea what we had to deal with (as Europeans (for the past 3 years, we had been the guinea pig with their Exynos attempt and it failed lately.

Samsung generally should learn from it and make one chip for their phone anywhere else in the world and make a firm decision on what to do (Apple's own SoC as an example) and not create two classes of users on the same phone.

But, after a couple of weeks contemplating, I decided to pull the trigger and get the S23 Ultra.

To be honest, there's not a massive difference between the two phones that hits you in the face. The jump didn't feel anywhere as massive as it did when I went from the S9 plus to the S21 Ultra. 

Except for one aspect. Battery life. I had just gotten close to 9 hours of SoT with Wifi and Bluetooth both on. 

I mostly browsed Reddit, an hour in a half of Youtube, about 2 hours of gaming and some social media browsing.

This obviously isnt the heaviest of loads, but its the same routine I did with my S21 Ultra, and that phone only lasted me about 6 hours, 7 the most.

How to Enable Cast Support in Media Output Switcher (One UI 5.1),1,11aqifo,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11aqifo/how_to_enable_cast_support_in_media_output/,0,"The One UI 5.1 changelogs specifically called out ""**Media output for Wi-Fi speakers**"" feature stating: *""If you want to continue listening to music on Wi-Fi speakers via Spotify Connect and built-in Chromecast, just open Media Output from the Quick Access Toolbar, not from the Music app""*

But after getting the Galaxy S23+ running One UI 5.1 I was disappointed when I first tried to switch playback from my phone to Google Home speakers using the 'Media Output' button in notification shade. It showed all my Google Cast devices, but it took several seconds to switch output to them and it didn't have any of the rich cast experience with album art and song information, just showed text 'Default Media Receiver' or something.

But tonight I accidently discovered a non-obvious setting page where you can change it from what appears to be Miracast mirroring, to actually use the Google Cast protocol. Apps need to be updated to support it, but it works great! Think it's only YouTube and YouTube Music at the moment.

**Instructions (screenshots here:** [**https://imgur.com/a/hG8QEMP**](https://imgur.com/a/hG8QEMP)**)**

1. Click on 'Media Output' in notification shade
2. Click the 'Gear' in top-right
3. Click on Wi-Fi speaker playback preference
4. Select 'Casting' to use Google Cast instead of the default 'Mirroring'

My Experience After 1 Week From An iPhone 12 Pro Max,16,11a7k94,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11a7k94/my_experience_after_1_week_from_an_iphone_12_pro/,47,"I recently switched from the iPhone 12 Pro Max and made a post about my switch and some folks said I will be back to using an iPhone after and that I am in a honeymoon phase and blah blah blah. Well one week later, I have never been happier about making the switch. This has been my experience so far after a week.

Battery Life: I started out with a decent  SOT of around 5 hours. I have to say this is not really bad and as someone who works a lot and does not mind charging my phone once or twice a day, SOT is sufficient for me. But I decided to see if I could push it further. So I decided to optimize my phone and here's how I did it:

1) I never charge the phone when the phone is hot. This is very important even than turning on to protect the battery.

2) I also realized adaptive brightness was overestimating the brightness I needed. So I set up modes and routines for the times I get home and around the times I sleep. Around the time I get home, my At home mode sets the brightness to 4% which is more than enough for me. Around the time I sleep, I have a routine set to turn off the phone if I plug the charger in to keep the phone cool and it also turns to protect the battery on to keep the phone's battery from stress overnight.

3) I also make sure to close apps I am not using anymore so the ram doesn't try to keep it open + RAM uses a significant amount of battery.

After doing this SOT went from 5 hours to 9-11 hours depending on the use which involved watching Netflix(the screen is so good lol), using social media, reading, etc.

Camera: 

The camera out of the box was great but it somehow didn't process some pics properly imo. But somehow it's like it got better overnight. The pics coming out of the phone are crazy good now not even kidding. Some Portraits shots  I took the other day of my kid look like they were professionally photographed. I can't explain what I did to improve the camera so much but one thing I noticed is that the more lighting the better. Also being stable when taking a photo really helps. won't decide to go into shutter lag because that's a whole post of its own.

Other:

Apps run smoothly with like one lag because I have labs turned on (which they did mention could cause some lags), SPen has been amazing been using it more times than I can count, pop out the pen, write something on AOD, pin it, and never forget.

 Review after a week:  I still think this is the best phone out there. With all the features it provides. There are many other things that I could go on and on about the phone but that will make this post too long. Not saying it's perfect, I don't expect it to be and after one week it's one of the best purchases I have made in a while.

PS: One thing I really dislike about the phone is Samsung emojis. Pure shit. Thank God Android is highly customizable. I currently use iPhone emojis on my S23 Ultra. Please leave any more tips that can help me better optimize my phone. Thanks",1677183468.0

Recently, I made the switch from my trusty Samsung Galaxy S10 to the newer, more advanced S23 Ultra. While I love my new device, I couldn't help but notice that my S10 is still in great condition and fully functional, except for its battery life. So, I've been thinking about ways to repurpose it and make the most out of it.

I'm curious to hear how other people have repurposed their older smartphones. Have you found any creative uses for your old devices? Maybe you've integrated them into a work desk setup or found a way to use them as a security camera or music player.

Personally, I'm considering using my S10 as a dedicated music player or a bedside clock with an alarm feature. I've also heard of people using their old devices as a home security camera, a remote control for their smart home devices, or even as a backup phone in case of emergency.

If anyone has any other suggestions or ideas, I would love to hear them. It would be great to repurpose my S10 in a way that adds value to my daily routine and reduces e-waste.

S23 Ultra's WiFi problem seems to happen only on WiFi 6 routers; no issues if using WiFi 5,36,119tp4j,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/119tp4j/s23_ultras_wifi_problem_seems_to_happen_only_on/,82,"So like many people, I had the issue of my 23 Ultra getting the ""connected without Internet"" error when connected to my WiFi 6 router (TP-Link EX221-G2u), forcing the phone to default to mobile data (thank God I have 160GB a month).

Suspecting it had something with the WiFi 6 protocol, I swapped back to my old WiFi 5 router. The phone has since maintained the connection for more than 24 hours, where before it would drop the WiFi 6 connection within an hour or two.

It's my only WiFi 6 device; all my other WiFi 5 devices connect just fine to the WiFi 6 router (defaulting to the WiFi 5 protocol). None of the other setting tweaks shared by others seem to work.

Does anyone know if there is a way to force the S23 Ultra to operate solely on the WiFi 5 5GHz protocol, through a WiFi 6 router?

Edit: added my exact router model. Also, managed to disable 802.11ax (WiFi 6) on my router so it defaults to 802.11ac (WiFi 5), and it's been very stable so far. But it's just a workaround for now and not a true fix because those of us with this problem cannot use our phones to their advertised potential.",1677145016.0
Can Samsung stop messing with Routines?,5,11a70g0,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11a70g0/can_samsung_stop_messing_with_routines/,6,"Anyone knows where I can post ""feedback"" for Samsung to read?

I have 1 single routine, which is ""Night Time"". Set to turn on at 12am-9am, which will trigger a bunch of stuff (DND, Night filter, etc.).

Previously on OneUI 4, when it was just ""Routines"", I was able to just use a quick toggle to disable all routines if I decide that I don't want my ""night time"" routine to be running at say 2am, then toggle it again to turn it on when I want it back on.

Then with OneUI 5, they made it ""Modes & Routines"", and the quick toggle stopped working. So I had to go into the Modes & Routines app to disable/enable the routine whenever I want to.

Now with OneUI 5.1, they once again messed with it. If I disable the routine when it's running, I can't re-enable it for some reason.

This is so frustrating, it was working fine in OneUI 4, why did they add modes and screwed everything up.",1677182148.0

Samsung Customer Service,7,11a2gw6,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11a2gw6/samsung_customer_service/,7,"Just wanted to put this out there. I'm in a bunch of different subreddits related to Samsung and their products. I am constantly seeing people say something to the effect of ""Great products but the worst customer service of any company"". 

I've been using their products almost exclusively for the last 10 years and am not the easiest customer in terms of expectations. Meaning I'll send my phone in for a repair/service more than a few times over the course of that time. I have never had a bad experience with them. My issues always get solved with minimal headache. And I would even say dealing with them is almost always a pleasant experience. There was only one occasion where I was almost let down. Last year, after 4 or 5 months of ownership, I sent in my Z fold 3 to get the main display replaced as it had started to develop little cracks down the center of the crease. But the main display did have accidental damage on it that i caused within the first week of ownership. (a few dead pixels) But the two were not related. After I sent in the phone, they basically said it wouldn't be covered under warranty and they would need $500 to replace the display.  I called Samsung after seeing that email and complained about how the two issues are unrelated and the agent said that she would try to see if she can get that point across and get the screen replaced under warranty. I wasn't expecting much after we got off the phone since i had been hearing so many people complain about their customer service. Anyway, I got an email a few hours later stating that the repair was made under warranty and the phone was being overnighted to me.

Since this post is much longer than I had anticipated, I won't explain the pleasant experience I had with them over the past few days. Just Know that as somebody who deals with Samsung customer service at least once a year, I have never been let down. And I would even say that of all the companies i have dealt with, Samsung, IN MY EXPERIENCE, has had by far the best customer service.",1677171197.0
S23 Light-Mode Experiences,124,119ishd,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/119ishd/s23_lightmode_experiences/,95,"Going to keep it brief as I can. Testing Light Mode on the base S23 which claims ~30-40% power/heat savings for ~10% performance off the top on the S23.

**Performance:** I cannot force a scenario where I notice the 10% performance hit. I've even tested it with Skyline Emulator (something that pushes the SOC to the max, yet Samsung does not detect as a game so light mode appears to be intact).

**Battery:** A definite boost but its within a range that might seem placebo but seems a bit too good to be just that. ~5-10% increase which on the S23 which already had solid battery life is actually a good bit of time. I think the impact to battery life with DeX usage and while multitasking in general was pretty noticeable 

**Heat:** Biggest benefit by miles. Android Auto with GPS (wired and wireless) ends up ice-cold, DeX and multitasking (was already not so bad) doesn't even warm it up, really it's only tasks that kick the GPU on that will heat up the phone anymore.

**Conclusion / my 2-cents:** If you can't specify a need for the max clockspeeds (excluding gaming when light mode disables itself) then you should absolutely be using light mode, or at the very least try it out for a few days. Outside of Geekbench I absolutely never used/felt the top 10% of this SD8G2(fg).. but I definitely feel these efficiency benefits.",1677111474.0
S22 was the worst decision ever,0,11atpz3,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11atpz3/s22_was_the_worst_decision_ever/,73,"I got the S22 for my birthday in december 2022 and I feel like I made my parents waste 700€. My previous phone (2019-2022) was S10e and before that an S4 so, although I like iPhone better, I'm more comfortable with Samsung but this phone (S22) doesn't feel like an upgrade in any way. Here are the 2 main things I suffer the most with this phone:

1. Selfie camera is disgusting. In social media apps (Whatsapp, bereal, ig...) if there's low light, the pic will turn out grey, it doesn't capture any color and my face has patches of my skin tone color in a grey background. Quality is awful. 

2. Charging takes forever. I don't know why but  I cannot use my phone while charging because it doesn't charge at all, it just maintains the same % or charges 1%/5min. Literally today I was doing breakfast while watching YT in the background, my phone started at 24% and in the course of exactly an hour, it only charged up to 31%. That's 7% in 60 minutes = 1% every 8 minutes. And I use the cable that comes with the phone.

Overall experience: As a regular person, not an expert, not a computer fan etc... This phone hasn't given me any new things, or improved in almost any way what I had in the S10e. I feel like the only thing I've noticed is the smoothness of a brand new phone vs a 3year old phone with tons of pics, apps in there which isn't really a point for the S22 because that's the purpose of buying a new phone. But even with barely 3 months of use, it still has its moments of running slow and bugging itself. 

As I said in the begging of the post, I feel like I (my parents) wasted 700€ and that I'm going to be stuck with this crap the next 3-5 years. If anyone out here has had the same experience as me, please share it so that way I know that I'm not alone or crazy. And if your experience with the S22 has been the complete opposite of this, share it too and hopefully give me tips on how I can get 100% of S22.",1677251680.0

He said he could take it in and provide another €200 discount if I did that (for a phone that's worth absolutely nothing).

Finally Europe gets snapdragon. Pre order S23. Physically, the device is amazing. Great display, great speakers, great size, can remove almost all the bloatware. 
But the camera…is terrible.

***12 mp photos*** - great in good lighting. Grainy and blurry as shit indoors.

***50 mp photos*** - WTF. Takes 5 seconds to process and turns up hdr and saturation to a 100 with scene recognition off. This can be resolved by installing the camera assistant and setting the shutter speed to prioritise speed over quality and turning on the scene recognition. When you prioritise speed, it doesn’t apply the post processing. But the hit to quality is noticeable.

***Shutter lag*** - I didn’t think this would be an issue. But it is. Tried to sort this out via the camera assistant, but still blurry photos of my kid. I did a side by side comparison by taking photos from both, the s23 and my iPhone and the iPhone took 12 photos while the s23 took 6.
The lag is unbearable. 

My wife tried to take some photos from the car and they were all blurry and the focus was all over the place. 
Never happens with the iPhone. 

**ExpertRAW** - 

***50 mp***- Horrible over processed , green tinted photos. Akin to non raw 50 mp ones. It’s supposed to be raw ? With little to no processing. It’s especially horrible at night. Raises all shadows, saturation and HDR 100%

***12 mp*** - fine again. 

Tried toggling auto hdr in settings. Didn’t help. 

***Video*** - 

Always starts off choppy, but smoothes out eventually. 
Also notice the lights in the videos taken at night to be flickering a lot. 

All this over processing also means I never know how a photo is going to turn out. I’m looking at something and expect to take a photo of what I see. 10 seconds later, you have a photo that is over processed to shit with it looking nothing like what I see. 

Maybe I got a dud.

From S22 Ultra to an S23+ I LOVE IT!,15,11hk8ct,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11hk8ct/from_s22_ultra_to_an_s23_i_love_it/,15,"Hello all, I talked about it for a while and yesterday I acted on it. I'll sum it up, I had an s21 Ultra, and loved it but hated the size. Best buy had a killer deal and I got an s22 ultra for $15 paid for outright(essentially a free new phone). But I wanted an S22+ because of the form factor. Fast forward to now, and I wanted to buy an S23+.

I went to my local best buy and bought an S23+ by trading in a cracked galaxy s7 I got from eBay for $40. I also received a $100 Best Buy gift card. I did the bill credit thing but I don't mind. Today I sold my s22 ultra for $600 cash and am very happy! In the end, after I subtract the taxes, the new phone case, the s7 phone, and the $199 balance over the next 3 years, I'm up $220 cash and a $100 gift card plus a free galaxy s23+! (I also turned the cracked s7 into a Verizon store for the $800 bill credits)

Onto the phone! I LOVE the battery life! I thought it was overhyped but it's real! 

My S22 Ultra SOT was 4-6.5 hours MAX with 1080p mode(not 1440p) It was always dying with minimal use.

My S23 Plus SOT is 7-9 hours! Same usage! It's insane how a 300mah small battery can outperform an Ultra series phone. I can only imagine the S23 ultra sot! 

Overall it's an upgrade for me! I like the smaller size, I have 256gb now vs the 128gb, love the battery life and I LOVE the flat screen! I am so happy with the device! Samsung did a great job! This is honestly how the S10+ was to me when I first got it!

Opinions on the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra for Digital Art / Clip Studio Paint?,10,11hjd6w,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11hjd6w/opinions_on_the_galaxy_tab_s8_ultra_for_digital/,3,"Hi all,

I am a hobby artist. I occasionally sell commission work.

One piece of technology I have wanted since 2010 was a portable digital sketchbook.

I have always used Windows for my computer OS. I use a Samsung Galaxy phone currently. I have enjoyed Android far more than iOS.

The idea of having a tablet that would pair up easily with my current workspace is exciting. I'm excited about the idea of being able to use my preferred art program of Clip Studio Paint with all the brushes and assets I have for it already rather than Procreate. I also like that CSP pairs with your smartphone while using a tablet for easy access to shortcuts. I know CSP requires a separate subscription plan to use on a tablet versus a desktop, but that's not really an issue to me.

I also recall in one review that certain Wacom pens work with the S8 Ultra. I think it's just the Wacom One pen, but I would be interested in hearing about any other options. 

I currently use a Huion Kamvas Pro 16 screen tablet to draw on. It stays tethered to my desktop.

So many artist buddies recommend an iPad Pro and iPencil combo. The only real advantage an iPad and iPencil have is less visible lag/stroke latency. I find it more convenient to stick with Windows OS items.

The S8 Ultra does have visible lag in the S-pen on review videos during screen extension use, as well as within Clip Studio Paint if a high stabilization setting is turned on.

If any artists have a screen tablet similar to a Cintiq or Huion as well as an S8 Ultra, does having a portable tablet help your workflow? How easy is it for you to transition your active files/projects between your desk space and mobile space? Do you notice a lag in the pen strokes in certain programs or settings? 

I am also hoping that incorporating this tablet into my study space will help me with college studies, as I imagine that annotations and notes will be easier with the dual workspace option and marking directly on the document.

So I'm curious of this scenario.  I primarily carry my work phone as my team will need me 24x7.   Because of this I use the ""Secure Folder"" feature and add WhatsApp (personal phone number), Facebook, etc on it.   I do this because work cannot access the secure folder.  The MDM can delete the secure folder, and unlock the mainphone, but not the ""Secure Folder""     Its also a nice way to keep work/personal separated.

if I add my personal phone line to my eSIM,  is there two different text messaging/phone call icons?  Would I be able to keep one inside the ""Secure folder""",1677784444.0

Sorry for spelling mistakes

It all started when I wanted to leave Apple so I started looking and only heard good things about Samsung. It was all good util i wanted to change Icons a few years ago and had to resort to Hex_ to do so and even then it wasn't like any other Android its was so hard then I started noticing other stuff that was locked for example E-Fuse that wasn't well disclosed or that you need samsung headphones to clear the phones cache. Then I started to understand that they tricked me to get into a closed ecosystem like apple. Then I started to litsen to Luise Rohsman on YouTube and even if I don't like everything he stands for I agree that a 1500$ device that I HAVE PAYED FOR should me MINE and not locked. Then they stoped having Micro SD card expansion. Then tried to stop right to repair and removed the Charger that came in the box. They have had so many chances to be good but the choose to not do them. Thats the Phycologick definition of **EVIL**!!!!!!! They are one of the Worst Companies hand in hand with Meta, Apple, Google, Nestle, Kellogg's and Amazon. I am feed up with their behavior. Thats why I am leaving Samsung for good!

Galaxy A33 + Buds2 for 284€ or wait for Galaxy A34,1,11g9hjj,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11g9hjj/galaxy_a33_buds2_for_284_or_wait_for_galaxy_a34/,2,"Hi, i currently have a Galaxy A20e that i use as a secondary work phone (this is, the intended use is light: check emails, some videocalls, browsing, social media and maybe snap some photos to scan documents). I want to upgrade, as A20e is slow as hell and is soon to lose security support (this is key for me). My main phone is an iPhone, but i usually buy Samsung for me and my family when i need Android alternatives (my parents have A52S and A53 for instance), mainly due to the extended update support.

Checking the Samsung website i saw a deal on the Galaxy A33, where you get the phone (in blue, 6+128) with free Galaxy Buds2 (in black) for a total of 284€ (normally the pack is 299 but there is a 5% off coupon). You could take it a bit lower in educational discounts for 249€ but without Buds2.

I know that the Galaxy A34 is close to be released this month, but will probably cost more than this (at least 369€, and rumors say a possible increate to 420-430€). It should also have a Dimensity processor instead of Exynos. A33 should still have 3 year of OS-upgrades + 4 security patches in store, which is really nice for me. New phones released this year from other manufacturers will have less support than A33.

Would you say buying the A33 with this offer is worth it for the intended use, or should i wait for the A34?

Pro Tip: eSim can make your phone trackable if lock or stolen,108,11g7s4m,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11g7s4m/pro_tip_esim_can_make_your_phone_trackable_if/,84,"For all those unaware if your telecoms carrier allows you to use eSims I highly recommend that you switch to one if it's not an inconvenience.

Samsung phones require a password to turn the phone off if you're phone is locked. If someone who stole your phone removes your sim card it will be harder to track your cellphone. With an eSim installed as long as you have power and data, your phone will be able to send you its location. Otherwise, you're relying on Samsung Smarthings Find Network which only uses other Samsung phones' Bluetooth networks to help you find your phone.

This also works great for travelling too. I use an eSim app and just pay for data when I travel. It's easy to install and when the plane lands I can turn off airplane mode, toggle the new eSim on and have data right away.

This only works for people who have password/fingerprint/faceid locks on their phone and who don't need to move their sim around to other devices.

I hope this helps make Samsung phones less desirable to steal or keep!

Thinking of switching to S23 ultra (lifetime IPhone User),9,11fc3uw,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11fc3uw/thinking_of_switching_to_s23_ultra_lifetime/,47,"Hey guys and girls, you probably get so many of these posts but I thought I would post as I'm at a big crossroads for myself.

I'm a lifelong Apple user, IPhone 14 pro max, AirPods Pro/ Max, AirTags, Apple Watch Ultra and the list goes on. But the problem is I'm just bored, it works, it all works seamlessly with little problems but at the same time with no excitement anymore, and as someone who loves tech and new features Apple just isn't doing anything innovative for me.

I tried the S22 ultra when it came out last year along with the watch 4 classic and I did really like them but I was so far into the Apple ecosystem that everything just felt odd and eventually I changed back. Now the S23 range is out and my head won't let me go 5 mins without thinking about switching.

But if I'm truly honest with you l'm slightly afraid to do so. My entire family is Apple and iMessage is just so easy, I use FaceTime for weekly calls and AirPods Max are the only headphones l've found that both look good on me and actually sound good with best in class NC and Transparency mode. Also the Apple Watch ultra is something I couldn't live without, I hated Apple Watch before the ultra came out due to battery, but the battery life and water resistance as well as (in my opinion) best interface on a smart watch is just great for me.

Even with all this though I still want to switch, from people with experience of just the S22/23 ultra or of both Apple and Samsung, could you give me some suggestions on how to make the transition easier or benefits of doing so. I know I could still use my AirPods Max but does anyone have any problems using them with android? Same with the watch 5 pro. How does it compare to the ultra? I've watched countless videos on the matter but I always find that YouTubers perspectives are a little biased and usually not as extensive as a full time user of the products.

Again I know people probably see this a fair amount on the subreddit and feel free to tell me if this post isn't allowed but some actual user reviews and tips would be really helpful.",1677696607.0

Samsung Galaxy S23+ Touch Sensitivity.,0,11f16pr,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11f16pr/samsung_galaxy_s23_touch_sensitivity/,37,"Hey all.

I just got my Samsung Galaxy S23+ a couple of days ago coming from a OnePlus 6T. I put a Spigen glass screen protector on it the moment I took it out of the box before turning it on. This is the first Samsung phone I've had since the Galaxy S6.

And something is really killing the experience for me. The touch sensitivity. It feels so unresponsive. I find that swiping left and right feels slow and swiping up and down feels like it's dragging. The OnePlus felt so fluid and smooth but this takes a lot of effort to scroll having to put much more pressure and drag further to make it move. Even then sometimes it barely scrolls and sometimes misses my touch at all. It seems so inconsistent. And I've turned on the setting for increased sensitivity for screen protectors. 

Is anyone else noticing this or just me? It feels awful and honestly I'm thinking of sending it back and getting a new OnePlus. It just ruins the experience.

Also the settings are a mess in comparison. So many things I've had to search the internet to find because of it and some things just seem not as good. The OP has much more customization for a start. And a lot of things in OneUI feels counter intuitive.

Does anyone know if the notification tone and SMS tone can be separate? If so I haven't found it. I prefer the app and SMS tone to have separate sounds? Does anyone know if it can be done? It's stupid if not. No custom accent colours either which is stupid, just basic ones. On OP I could customise it at an RGB colour code level.

Also does anyone know if the auto play for videos can be turned off for the gallery?

Thank you all for reading and thank you in advance for comments and assistance. My main thing here that's driving me mad is the sensitivity and responsiveness.

Edit: so to all the folks suggesting it's likely the screen protector, I removed it and tried using the phone without it. No noticeable difference. OneUI just feels clunky compared to what I'm used to and the fingerprint scanner never recognises mine first time despite re-registering it. Unless I press down harder than I'm used to and a good amount of pressure at that. I guess I'm quite unhappy with the Samsung which feels overpriced for the experience.",1677669460.0

Finally got my Book 3 Ultra! Some performance notes.,2,11exmt3,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11exmt3/finally_got_my_book_3_ultra_some_performance_notes/,9,"I put together my thoughts so far here since I did not see much about the performance and battery life online yet. The laptop has been pretty decent to use, I was looking for a laptop that can handle a decent bit of gaming but also has a good battery life and is portable, this seems to work so far.

## Build Quality / Overall thoughts

Personally, I feel the build quality is good. I noticed a bit of screen wobble and the screen is super reflective. Having a numpad felt a bit weird in terms of positioning my hands. This is the first time I have thought that a trackpad can be ""too big"", I felt the keyboard was so far away sometimes, lol. The keys are also a bit shallow. But I did find myself getting used to these quirks over time.

## Performance

I was a bit disappointed to hear the fans running loud when playing a game or when running benchmarks but the game performance was not even close to what I was expecting from a 4070 (even though it runs at such a low wattage). That was until I switched on the High Performance mode in ""Samsung Settings"" app (it was already in high performance mode in windows battery settings), the performance was so much better after that! I only tested Dota 2 so far, I went from \~55-60 FPS to 100+ FPS with max settings in native resolution. Time Spy scores: [https://imgur.com/a/iY7Z7xB](https://imgur.com/a/iY7Z7xB)

## Battery Life

I have been playing with the laptop just for a few hours now, so I do not have any solid numbers. I saw \~35% decrease in battery when using it for 2 hours at half screen brightness, on the Quiet performance preset in Samsung Settings, adaptive refresh rate enabled, a second screen connected via SuperDisplay, have 15-20 chrome tabs open and playing videos constantly. I would estimate the battery life to be around 5.5 to 8 hours for medium to light use.

## Pros, Cons and Final Thoughts

* Pros
   * Display. Can't think of a better looking display, OLED looks so beautiful and 120 Hz looks plenty smooth
   * Form Factor. Pretty light for a (3.95lb/1.8kg) for a 16 inch laptop and pretty thin as well
   * Performance. I would list this as a Pro if I am not considering the price, the laptop is plenty capable, but a proper gaming laptop would have a way better performance (probably at the cost of battery life and/or good form factor)
* Cons
   * Price. The 'i9 processor' and 'RTX 4070' seems to be contributing more to the price than the performance imo.
   * Keyboard. The lack of a good key travel, the number pad making the overall layout awkward, the weirdly positioned arrow keys do leave quite a bit of room for improvement in this area.
   * Speakers. Really? Bottom facing speakers in 2023 on a $3k laptop? Having such a nice display makes this even more painful for me personally. But overall not too bad.

The screen just might be what makes me keeps this laptop. Let me know if you like to know something about the laptop or if there are things you want me to run on this laptop.",1677656169.0

I bought the Iphone to try it out again after some long years of not having one, but the phone every time started to get really hot in a point that i had to use a fan to continue to use it, the battery lasted 3 hours even tho the phone was basically turned off the hole time, the phone started glitching right after I downloaded the IOS 16, like the screen suddently started to have ghost touch, I even changed the screen but no success.",1677632643.0

Is the S23 Ultra seriously that much more scratch prone than past devices (like the S22U)? Never have used a screen protector before.,2,11end2f,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11end2f/is_the_s23_ultra_seriously_that_much_more_scratch/,26,"I've been using smartphones since the original G1 and I've never used a screen protector. No cracks from drops, and no unreasonable scratches other than the micro scratches accumulated from general use. I'm looking at my S9+ that I used for like 4 years with no protector and it looks fine to me still. Little cuts here and there, nothing that I'd actually notice in general use.

Now I'm hearing that the S23U is so incredibly scratch prone that a screen protector is mandatory? Is it *really*? Like I understand micro scratches, they happen over time and it's whatever, but people are making this sound like something new. Like the Scratchpocalypse.

I like cases, always use one, but screen protectors always struck me as a hassle, and I'm having a hard time finding one I can use with the case I've already ordered. Whichever one I check it's either the thing bubbles a lot, doesn't work with cases, or ruins the fingerprint sensor (which I use a lot). I'd be willing to pay a lot for a perfect screen protector, but it doesn't seem to exist, so I'm rapidly leaning into skipping it altogether.

Basically, I'm asking if just using this thing without a protector will eventually result in a nigh unusable screen, or if we're just talking about the sort of thing that would bother a person examining the screen from the right angle with some light and a microscope? Is it noticeably worse than something like an S9+ or even the S22 ultra in terms of scratch resistance?",1677626451.0
How I Got A Factory Unlocked S23 Ultra for $306,1,11emhlm,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11emhlm/how_i_got_a_factory_unlocked_s23_ultra_for_306/,5,"First off, I always buy my phones outright, factory unlocked so they don't have specific carrier branding or carrier bloatware.  I then use them with a good reputable MVNO for about half the monthly cost of a service plan from a major carrier with the only downside being slower speed when you're around thousands of other people like in a stadium.

The carriers entice people with shiny new objects with gazillion dollars off deals because (a) they know the majority of consumers can't afford to buy the phone outright and (b) they make the big discount a monthly credit spread over 24-36 months so unless you have 3 or 4 lines with the carrier, you will be paying out the nose for the service which is where they make their profit so they can afford to give you low payments on the phone.  Try to leave before the 24-36 months and you have to give the phone back or pay it off and lose the remaining credits from the discount.

Google Fi and Spectrum have the best deals. Google Fi is more straight forward though. $600 off the phone at purchase and you just have to stay with them 120 days (Google Fi is a T-Mobile MVNO and also uses US Cellular Towers when it makes sense.)  Spectrum is convoluted about getting your money back (there's debate whether it's a service credit that they'll refund the unused portion of if you leave them after 60 days or a Visa Cash card 2 months later or whatever. and you'll get a Spectrum branded phone.

At Samsung Store, the pre-order deal cost with trading in my Note 20 Ultra was $807 including a $46 additional educational discount which pretty much anyone can get. Pass. (Almost forgot, they also threw in for Note 20 trades a free watch that you could net about $125 for on Ebay, so technically net would have been around $680.)

Google Fi, the phone was an instant $600 off or $599 ($649 with tax) 512GB model.  The monthly plan is, with a coupon for a $20 credit, a total of $60 more over the minimum 4 months than the comparable US Mobile plan I use.  So that's a total cost of $709.  The big catch is my Note 20 Ultra is mint condition. Sold it for $483.33 on Ebay.  Net after Ebay fees and shipping cost is $403.  So the net cost on upgrading to the S23 Ultra is $306.  And the best thing is I'm not stuck with a specific carrier branded phone (so it will have better resale value) and don't have to pay for a $40-$70 overpriced plan at Verizon, T-mobile, or AT&T for 2-3 years (I use no more than 10GB a month so a $20 15GB plan for a Verizon MVNO suits me great. Coverage is the same, speeds always adequate(even \*real\* high-speed 5G supported not basically relabeled 4G LTE speed all the time) and great customer service.)",1677624352.0

S23 Ultra terrible battery!,0,11eeutk,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11eeutk/s23_ultra_terrible_battery/,70,"I have had my S23 Ultra for a few weeks now and the battery life is absolutely nothing short of abysmal. I can only get a maximum of 4hrs of SOT, which is ridiculous for this flagship given the price I paid and that others are getting 8-9-10hrs SOT. It drains 1% for like every few minutes of usage.

I previously used Smart Switch to transfer from my S21+ and after reading that it can potentially cause battery drain I factory reset the phone. Nothing changed. Here are my settings:

- 120hz WQHD+
- Mix of WiFi 6 and LTE 4G (no 5g, good signal in my area)
- Brightness around 40%
- Bluetooth on (Galaxy Watch 4)
- Protect Battery (only charge to 85%)

I have a Bixby Routine set up to turn off wifi, mobile data, bluetooth and turn on airplane mode and battery saver, yet it still drains like 4-5% overnight. I can't imagine how much it will drain without that... I am 100% confident I have NO rogue apps draining my battery.

Coming from an s21+ (was getting 2h SOT, the only reason I upgraded was the battery life...) this feels like I got scammed by Samsung yet again. Do I have the shittiest luck in the universe or is samsung fundamentally bad? 

I apologize for the long rant and I'd really like some insight here because I am understandably pissed off when others are getting such crazy battery life.

I own a Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro since 2020. This phone was great in Performance and especially battery life, but unfortunately i've been having really bad ghost touch issues with it since 1.5 years ago with other issues as well. With that said I'm trying to avoid Xiaomi entirely.

I kept looking for a another midrange phone. Galaxy A73 was too expensive where I live (510$), and I heard about Performance issues about the A53 so it didn't really convince me.

I decided in the end to pick the A52s 5G, only to be given a used galaxy S10+ (exynos) as a gift recently. I like the S10+'s screen and Build material and also it's quite fast. But I tested its battery capacity with AccuBattery and it gave me 85% (3500 mAh) so I'm having doubts about its longevity.

I'm currently deciding whether I should stick with the Galaxy s10+ (exynos) ? Or Sell it and buy the A52s 5G ? I don't really care about updates unless they actually correct big issues with the OS, and I mainly use my phone to watch Youtube, take notes and take calls. And I could really use a good battery life like the note 9 Pro's and a bright screen outdoors especially when I'm traveling.

The S22 Ultra only has minor cosmetic damage. The reason for the trade-in is my battery is terrible for some reason; it doesn't last a work day. 

I got the S23 Ultra and sent in my S22 U. About a week later, I receive an email from Samsung that the S22 U was ineligible for full credit because the body or screen was cracked. Knowing the device was in very good condition when I sent it to them, I opted to have them return it instead of accepting $150 or so in credit for the device. 

After I chose to have it returned, I called Samsung's customer service to find out if there would be any options available to me if the phone does come back to me cracked or otherwise damaged and all I had for proof was my story vs theirs. The customer rep was super helpful. Apparently they make video recordings for their ""triage reports"" (or something) so he was able to find video evidence that my phone was not damaged. That was a relief. He offered me a $50 code to be emailed to me for all the trouble; the email never arrived. 

A few days later, I receive my S22 U and it's in the same condition I sent it out. Except! Samsung took my S Pen. I am sorry I did not make any video recordings of the device I was going to trade in.

Samsung S23 Ultra 8GB RAM vs 12GB RAM,17,11e2drg,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11e2drg/samsung_s23_ultra_8gb_ram_vs_12gb_ram/,34," 

Hi guys,

I want to buy a Samsung S23 Ultra but only the 8GB RAM variant is in stock where I live. I don't really game on my phone, just scroll a lot of Youtube and maybe some movies on Plex, but have a lot of tabs opened in Chrome (not sure if those take up a lot of RAM, while they're not displayed).

So I don't think i'm an extreme power user.

The 256 GB storage seems more than enough for my needs, I have the same on my current phone and I've never had the need to clean the space even once in 4 years.

My question is this:

Is 8 GB still okay to get as the 256 is exactly what I want, or should I wait for the 12GB RAM variants to be back in stock?

Is RAM much more important in 2023?

&#x200B;

I don't mind to have only 2-3 apps in memory before they close, what I don't want, is for the phone not not be as snappy next year, because of the lack of RAM.

Thanks!",1677578632.0

The phone just feels way more premium. (As it should considering the price difference)

-

**Still there are a few minor things that annoy me:**

* Volume buttons - This actually surprised me because when I first got the pixel I thought the placement was weird but over time it grew on me, It feels more natural now

**OneUi:**

* Folders - They just feel more thought through on the pixel, you can open and select the app you want with one hand instead with OneUi you must either shift the phone or use both hands (There is a setting in homeup on goodlock but the folder opening animation takes forever so it’s not usable in my opinion)
* App Drawer - There is no option to focus the search bar automatically
* App Drawer - No *real* app list (There is a setting on homeup but then you have ""priority apps"" pinned on top which makes the whole thing unusable)
* Quick Panel - The settings and power icons being at the bottom on the pixel makes quickly accessing them so much more convenient

Astro mode has some loose ends,5,11dyfgc,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dyfgc/astro_mode_has_some_loose_ends/,3,"So I've been using the astro mode the last couple days and it is awesome, but of course, some things could be improved (or maybe i'm using it wrong?;


-S-pen shutter in Expert Raw. I know using a 2sec timer works too, but it's not the same.

-Screen preview i think it's called in real cameras. 
Where if you're busy focusing, the screen will completely zoom in on a tiny part of your live screen preview so you can check the focus.

Usually things are very dark in your preview while astro shooting, so it helps being able to pick a random star and use that to focus on. 
Because of the lens switching i assume it's a fruitless effort to actually zoom in and focus. And then zoom back out. 

Focus peaking is nice but I'd rather preview it myself. Moon shots already prompt this same sort of preview when stabilising at 100x (in the camera app, not expert raw).


-The constellation overlay is cool but every time i've used it, it was off a fair bit. And when i saw some galaxy i could potentially zoom in on (i know) like M44 or something.. that's when i remember finding it while zooming in is going to be hell.


-The 4/7/10 min exposure feature may be broken. Not sure what happens but instead of one 7min exposure, tonight i notificed it gave me two 3,5min exposures. So 2 raw files and 2 jpegs. I do remember it's not the first time I've heard this.

Also took a 10min exposure and as far as exif data goes, that shot doesn't exist. 

Could all be due to built-in overexposure protection or something like it, but maybe it's actually buggy.

"Calling all Routine users: Is there any way to have phone charge if battery is below a certain % only, and not stop until it hits the Protect Battery (85%)",3,11dxscn,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dxscn/calling_all_routine_users_is_there_any_way_to/,19," 

I hate that Protect Battery puts the phone back on charge as soon as it drops to 84% after reaching 85%, the defined protect battery threshold.

Got a routine set up for the daytime to enable Battery Protect if placed on a charger during certain hours (11am - 3am). I'll never need 100% charge after a certain time, so getting to 85% is fine after 11am.

What I'm trying to do now is set up 2 routines.

**Routine 1** is simple: enable Protect Battery during certain hours (11am - 3am).

Routine 2 - I don't think I can do it, but maybe I'm missing something obvious? I've written how I want it to work:

**Routine 2 - Check if phone battery is low enough to charge**

* If phone placed on a wireless charger, check battery level  

   * If battery level above / = X (say 65%), then  

      * Don't charge
   * If battery level below X (say 65%)  

      * Charge (phone will charge to 85% due to Protect Battery = True)
   * If battery level ***drops*** below X  

      * Charge (phone will charge to 85% due to Protect Battery = True)

The idea - when wireless charging: to have the phone NOT charge to 85%, stop, fall to 84%, start charging to 85%.... repeat cycle...

Instead, I'd like to charge to 85%, then not have the phone charge again until it falls below 65%. It sounds super simple so I'm convinced I'm just being stupid.",1677561654.0

Fraudulent and no responsibility taken. Beyond disappointed and shocked.,8,11dukox,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dukox/fraudulent_and_no_responsibility_taken_beyond/,29,"Hi people,

I've posted this on Samsung Forums but just wanted to share my experience here.

So I've been buying from Samsung since the s4 line years and years ago. However, this is the first time I purchased from the official site. I bought the s23 during pre-order and used the trade-in program, but what happened over 2-3 weeks has completely made me lose faith and trust in Samsung. I will never buy a phone from them again.

I ordered the s23 ultra 512gb in cream with some phone accessories from the e-voucher. **AU230202-38617344** was my order number and I was stoked to see what Samsung had to offer. When I received it, turns out the side of the phone became a little scuffed and I asked for an exchange. The agent was kind enough and assured me the replacement process has been arranged. All I had to do is wait for the return label to be emailed and send it in. 

Now I don't know why a return label took almost a week to be sent, but It did on an afternoon and I sent it in as swiftly as I could. Both the s23 ultra and the a52s was mailed off, and I kept the tracking numbers.

The week after on a Wednesday, I got an email saying the refund has been completed. ??? I realized there must've been a mistake somewhere and contacted Samsung's live chat pronto. I asked for a replacement, not a refund, and the agent before also reassured me. The agent this time investigated the situation and acknowledged that they can see the refund request was clear, but their back offices marked it as 'lost in transit' and subsequently refunded me for it. Keep in mind both the phones showed up as 'delivered' on my AusPost tracking. 

I have asked multiple times for assistance, over live chat and live call, but none of the representatives had the authority to actually do anything about it, since the order is now ""complete"". They sent my case over to their 'VOC', whatever that is, and a week later today there is still no contact. 

I'm just beyond distressed and disappointed at this moment. I've lost 2 phones, 2-3 weeks of my time, and work opportunities. Such a big company and they had nothing to offer - no direct contact with their higher-ups, no ramification, and no adequate processes and quality checks in place to prevent incidents like this. I'd buy it again but, I am not paying $2,2k\~ to cover their mistakes and negligence when I paid $1569 rightfully during the pre-order. Samsung couldn't even offer me a voucher code to let me buy it again.

I don't even have a phone to use now, and it's thanks to me believing in Samsung in the first place. Again, I just have no words for Samsung's appalling processes and their negligence to customers. I don't want to ever buy from Samsung again, and this is just the experience I wanted to share.

So has anyone actually experienced subpar customer service and order negligence like this?? I'd be keen to hear people's thoughts. I'm also planning to buy the iPhone 15 ultra. Seriously screw Samsung. They also need to give me my crappy a52s back.

Thanks.

**UPDATE:** 

I received a call today, 3rd of Feb at 12:22PM. I assume it was from one of the many follow ups the Samsung reps raised for me. THE AGENTs MESSED IT UP AGAIN. 

He said, ""regarding the refund request raised for your phone, we just want to confirm if you have received it? Yes? Okay thank you!"" 👁️👄👁️ I intervened and complained that yes, I received the refund but that was not the point of this case at all. I NEVER specifically asked for the refund and only ever wanted AN EXCHANGE. So he ""changed his notes"" and said ""someone will be in contact with you asap"". No estimated date.",1677551861.0

Samsung's order processes are so bad they're an active cyber security risk to their customers,0,11dtq2q,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dtq2q/samsungs_order_processes_are_so_bad_theyre_an/,2,"This morning I received an SMS from a cell phone number I'd never seen before telling me my requested Samsung delivery date wasn't available and to click a link to rebook.

Now I have ordered from Samsung and am waiting for a product however, I get tons of delivery notification scams and am wise enough to initiate a chat with support.

Where I'm told not only can they not verify for me that they sent a message but that if I want to set a new requested date I'd need to click the link in the SMS provided.

Given the prominence of phishing scams and cyber crime in 2023 this is totally unacceptable.There's nothing in the message that can be used to verify it's legit and support can't or wont confirm that Samsung sent it and it's legit while telling me the only way to actually get confirmation and book a new date would be to click a link that can't be verified as trusted.**This is a terrifying level of disregard for customer safety.**

So I ask to have my concerns raised in a case and have an email sent to me with some level of follow up at a minimum I'd like to know im actually going to receive the product im paying thousands of dollars for.

This is not an option, Samsungs processes mean that sending me an email to be followed up can't be done.

I own probably somewhere in the ball park of $10,000 worth of Samsung goods and am stunned by the utter indifference to customers digital safety as well as complete in ability to provide clear information on an order.To the extent that I'm no longer going to by future Samsung products and will likely end up cancelling this order ... assuming I ever get a support agent that can help me.

Samsung need to seriously address their behavior and do a far better job of communicating clearly when their customers need to take action to ensure an order is delivered.

&#x200B;

Basically, it's the title. I'm closing in on a upgrade for my current phone (It's currently the S21 5G model) and I'm going to be sticking with Samsung going forward. Nothing but positives about my current phone with the only issue being the charging port currently is very buggy. As in, only charges at certain angles and sometimes it just disconnects the charger (I believe it might just be the charging port not holding the charger cable in right is all, but easy to get around).

&#x200B;

I was looking at the Z Flip 4 due to the size when shut is a big positive, my current job means having a large phone in my pocket will increase the chances of accidental presses and damage to the screen, my current screen protector that has been fantastic from getting the phone nearly 2 years ago, (I got a fantastic deal on the newest release due to how long the account has been on the provider).

&#x200B;

I've watched some YouTube videos, but the issue I've found is a lot of the big 'TechTubers' tend to focus fully on the positives, be it personal preference or if they don't want to upset Samsung I don't know, but I know the original model and the Z Flip 2 had several issues which I thought I'd ask before going for the plunge.

&#x200B;

Have they sorted out the issue the hinge had with it failing fast in daily use?

Has the battery life been improved? I work 12 hour shifts and while I'm not on my phone the entire 12 hours, I saw several people complaining even in rest mode the battery drained fast.

How is the front screen in terms of usefulness? It's not one that needs any sort of squinting to see in darker lights is it?

How is the build quality on it? Samsung phones in my experience have been really well built and can take a bit of a beating, not saying I'm going to be throwing the phone at the wall, but there will be times a box may hit it, will it hold up with a case?

&#x200B;

I won't be upgrading until April so I also don't know if they are going to be releasing a Z Flip 5 soon, which is another question actually.

I have been looking around both business and personal solutions providers for a case that may work, but all that I have found have turned out to either rely on magnets, rendering the stylus useless, or not having an option for popsocket/wallet/popwallet (which I currently use), and not having a popsocket or wallet option at all is unfortunately a dealbreaker. 

Really, if I could get a peak design case with no magnets but with access to all of the peak design accessories, I'd be happiest. Does anyone know of other good phone case systems with some modularity?",1677532554.0
The truth (literally!) no one tells you about Android vs iOS updates,173,11dkmpz,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dkmpz/the_truth_literally_no_one_tells_you_about/,89,"I was not sure where to post this observation, but since I love Samsung's version of Android, I would like to leave it there for people who are interested.  


Switcher here. I was an iPhone user for more than 10 years but in 2022 I switched to Samsung for a second time. Partly because of being impressed by an old Samsung phone from 2012. You will probably not believe but it still goes to Internet, uses latest Chrome version (or any browser of your choice) and even installs most apps from Google Play. And it is on KitKat 4.4. I mean, it is the same age as the iPhone 5 that already cannot open any webpage on it's old iOS 10 and install any app (maximum that could have been installed, original was iOS 6 that is the same age as Android 4)  


Generally, one of the major reasons I switched was being tired of constant updates.   
Often I see people on the web and on Reddit particularly writing that ""no Android manufacturer has such software support as Apple"". As an ""Apple veteran"" I have went through 13 major updates on different devices (iPad 1, iPad Air 2, iPhone 4, 5, 6s, 11 Pro). And the way they serve the update didn't change throughout the years: Apple literally downloads it to your device without your consent when you plug the phone on charger and wifi, then out of the blue (often when you are very busy and do not have time for that) they ask ""Install update now or at night"", and you can only postpone it by clicking ""at night"". Then you can delete it from storage but every time a newer version comes out ( for example 15.0.1, 16.1.3 etc) it will download again.  


Most people will just hit ""install"" and it will download. It is a hit-or-miss, but usually every update is a slowdown comparing to the original version. Users often face bugs with every single update. And there is no way back, you cannot revert to the original version if you don't like the one that you had installed.  


Sure thing, updates bring security, better experience, blah blah blah and also bring users to the store in search of a new phone. It is a simple psychological trick everyone knows at Apple, and considering how hard it is to get free of the ""ecosystem"", users usually rush to get a newer iPhone.  


But what if you just do not update on iPhone or iPad? First two years it is going to be OK. After that time sites usually start to lag and not open pages correctly, or the load time increases significantly. This is especially a problem of all banking apps due to them constantly updating all the site code. In the same time, this issue DOES NOT EXIST ON ANDROID. Yes, you get me right: iOS update means everything. If you do not update, you are out. Because all the browsers on iOS are based on Safari's WebKit, so literally if you download Chrome it will change nothing except the skin, sites won't open and there are gonna be even more slowdowns. After 3 years developers usually drop support for older iOS versions and require newer ones. And 3 years literally means 3 major iOS versions, thus people on iOS13 cannot get most new apps and app versions on their devices unless they update or buy a new iPhone if their ones does not support the update.  


In fact, you are in Matrix and are provided with ""two pills"": have a slow but up-to-date iPhone or have a fast but unsupported one.

On the other hand, on Android you can install any modern app (and browser) even as it turns out, on 4.4 KitKat which is the similar age as the iOS 5.1.1 that is installed on my mentioned above iPad 1.   


In fact, getting no update on Android phone does not mean you will have problems with apps and services. It just means that you don't get newer OS features and have a less secure phone. But if you know at least something in tech, does it even make sense? Modern Android is already dummy-proof enough not to allow the install from untrusted sources, as well as you won't probably get anything if you use up-to-date browser (which you do).  


In comparison, how does it feel to have constant updates on Apple? You basically become a beta tester for anything Apple wants to install on your phone. You have to deal with lags, bugs, slowdowns and incompatibility issues. And you cannot ""roll back to original app version"" like on Android or just re-flash the original OS unless you have SHSH blobs (you surely won't have those at the moment you already updated). And in the end you have to buy a new phone because yours does not work as you wish it to. Also you cannot just go and install old app ""apk"" (.ipa in iOS) from web, because ""security"" and copyright, unless you saved the ones tied to your Apple ID on your PC or Mac.  


I have lots of examples of how updates killed my iDevices, but will tell you only the recent one. Since 2014 I was effectively making music on my iPad. I had even bought official Apple lightning to usb adapter to be able to connect my midi keyboard. After I installed the iOS 15 update which I didn't want to do but had to (one of the apps stopped updating) the midi protocol stopped working, synth does not connect and GarageBand and similar apps freeze when it tries to connect and... nothing in the end. Like, WTF. I was making music and suddenly cannot. And you know what is the worst? I cannot go back and this device is now called ""obsolete"", so it does not get any updates or patches except some security ones that do not fix such issues. Now my only choice is to buy a newer iPad and HOPE the problem is fixed already, yet I am sure it is not and the device itself is not worth it.  


So next time you see ANYONE bragging that Android has no updates, show them my post and see their reaction. Because personally I would rather get no system updates than all these untested, poorly optimised and useless yearly updates like it is on Apple devices.  


People who still have Galaxy s3, s4, s5 and older than s10, I know you are here on this sub and I want to hear your voice! Please, tell what is your experience in using the non-updated smartphones? Is it a deal-breaker or something it is possible to live with?",1677526570.0

Apple’s iPhones Winning Over Gen Z—and the World’s Premium Market,52,11dcdcf,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dcdcf/apples_iphones_winning_over_gen_zand_the_worlds/,226,"The Wall Street Journal

Trend puts pressure on rival Samsung, maker of high-end Android smartphones

SEOUL—Consumers around the world are increasingly choosing  Apple Inc.’s iPhones over high-end Android smartphones, with younger users seen as pushing the company toward the level of dominance in the market globally that it has enjoyed in the U.S.

From Europe to Asia, Apple’s market lead in the premium bracket  is growing, and polls show that people in their teens and early 20s,  known as Gen Z, increasingly see the iPhone as a must-have. Converts say  they are drawn by its design, cameras and AirDrop features for sharing  photos.

The trend is putting Apple’s chief rival, Samsung Electronics Co., under pressure and threatening the South Korean  company’s lead in the overall global smartphone market. Samsung has been  promoting its splashy foldable phones and 100x zoom cameras on the latest Galaxy S23 Ultra that brought a “wow” from Elon Musk on Twitter.

In Samsung’s backyard, where the brand’s Android smartphones have held sway, Apple’s clout has been growing since the company opened its first store in South Korea  in 2018. Apple now has four stores in the country, where its  mobile-payment system Apple Pay will soon become available for the first  time.

Around 52% of people age 18 to 29 in South Korea were using an  Apple smartphone as of 2022, up from 44% two years earlier, according to  polls by Gallup Korea. Samsung’s share of this age group slipped to 44%  from 45% in that time, the polls showed. For all older age groups,  Samsung phones remain most prevalent.

Chung Kyung-rim, a 22-year-old college student in Seoul, said nearly  all of her peers use an iPhone. Apple’s reputation for prettier designs  and good photos has stuck through the years, she said, though she thinks  Samsung’s devices have improved in looks and likes the diverse colors of Samsung’s latest flip phones, she said.

Apple’s rise among young people will likely help the U.S.  firm’s position in the high-end phone business that it has been leading.  Apple’s share of worldwide shipments of smartphones priced at $800 and  above grew to 76% last year from 65% in 2018, while Samsung’s declined  to 17% from 27%, according to Canalys, a tech-market researcher. China  has been one major driver of growth for Apple after U.S. sanctions crippled another rival, Huawei Technologies Co.

Samsung remains the world’s largest smartphone maker by overall  shipments, a title it has held since 2012. Even here, Apple is closing  in on its rival. Samsung’s market share has held roughly steady at  around 21% for the past five years, according to Canalys, while Apple’s  share climbed to 19% in 2022 from 15% in 2018.

High-end smartphones are critical for phone makers as they  bring in the biggest profits and showcase technological capabilities and  leadership, said Tom Kang, a Seoul-based director at Counterpoint  Research.

The pricier phone segment also represents a pocket of resilience in  an industry that has been sliding. Last year, global shipments of  smartphones priced above $800 grew 1%, while overall shipments of  smartphones fell 12%, according to Canalys.

A Samsung spokesman noted that preorder volumes for the recently launched Galaxy S23 smartphone series were higher than for the prior year’s models, with 60% of consumers choosing the most-expensive Galaxy S23 Ultra.

Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.

In the U.S., where Apple accounted for 77% of the  premium-smartphone market last year according to Canalys, one reason for  the popularity of iPhones among young people has been the prevalence of  iMessage, Apple’s messaging app that is widely used and designates different colors for iPhone users and Android users.

Elsewhere in the world that is seen as less of an edge because third-party mobile messengers are more mainstream, from WhatsApp in Europe to KakaoTalk in South Korea.

Young people around the world say they are attracted by  Apple-exclusive features such as AirDrop, which enables easy sharing  between iPhones between friends, and preferences for Apple’s photography  and design.

For years, Apple’s marketing has focused on taking cinematic photos and videos.

Today’s top-end iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smartphone both have  similar camera components and excel at capturing quality high-resolution  photos, said Choi Kab-soo, a travel photographer living in Seoul who  runs smartphone-photography classes.

Some differences in the color expression of the photos might  make people feel that Apple’s phones take better photos in everyday  settings, said Mr. Choi, who uses an iPhone.

Sarah Carrivale, a 24-year-old graduate student living in  Paris, has noticed that more people around her age are using  iPhones—around 7 in 10 she estimates.

She switched to an iPhone 12 two years ago, after using a  string of Android devices including ones from Samsung and a Chinese  brand. After taking a while to get used to the iPhone, she said she is  satisfied with its durability, ease of navigation and cameras.

“Once you get an iPhone, in a way there’s no turning back,” Ms. Carrivale said.

Across Western Europe, Android users under the age of 25 were  almost three times more likely to prefer Apple for their next smartphone  than older age groups, according to a poll last year by Canalys of  4,000 individuals from the U.K., Germany, Spain and Italy. Apple users  under 25 were more than twice as likely as Android users of the same age  to stick with their respective operating systems, the poll showed.

Apps on an iPhone feel faster and more glitch-free, even if the  specs are similar to an Android device, said Nicholas Leonzi, a  26-year-old retail worker in London. He tried out a Samsung Galaxy S21  Ultra in 2021, which had “cool” features  like charging his Galaxy Buds Pro earphones on the back of the phone. A  regular phone upgrader, he reverted back to Apple after a year and is using the latest version of the AirPods Pro.

Apple has also grown by building its products based on the same  operating system, helping strengthen user retention and brand loyalty.  Android smartphones have far more players in the mix because it isn’t a  closed operating system like Apple’s.

“As younger consumers grow stickier to the Apple ecosystem, it’ll become harder for Samsung to compete with Apple,” said                       Nicole Peng,          a Canalys senior vice president.

Samsung, which leads the Android segment, is working to catch up  by focusing efforts on making its products from smartphones to TVs to  appliances, and those of partner brands, work together in the most  hassle-free manner possible.

One bright spot for Samsung is that it is leading the foldable-smartphones category  it helped pioneer. Sales of foldable phones represent less than 1% of  the smartphones shipped worldwide today, but their increased popularity  could boost Samsung’s future position in the premium category, analysts  say. Apple has yet to announce any plans for foldable phones.

Lee Hye-jin, whose high-school-age daughter and son have owned  iPhones since middle school in Seoul, highlighted the iPhone’s appeal to  younger generations. She estimated that 7 out of 10 of her children’s  classmates are iPhone users.

“They say it’s more ‘hip’ to use Apple,” she said.",1677505999.0

I was an Apple user since the iPhone 4, which was a great time and a lot of innovation on Apple's part.

First I tried the Z Flip 4, but returned it because of the narrow screen (it's so narrow!). 

When I saw that the s23 Ultra came out, I was really tempted. I bought the new phone and gifted my 13 Pro to my girlfriend who doesn't really care about phones at all, lol. 

I'm using it now for a couple of days and I can say I'm in love. The notification system was weird for me in the beginning, but now I wonder how I could ever like the notification system on IOS. It's so fast and intuitive, you can directly answer in the notifications, you can scroll in widgets. I love watching movies on YouTube and Netflix. I can customize stuff how I want. It has great night shots, that I took last weekend are way better than on iPhone (to me at least, everyone has different taste).

Every so often it just stops working. You put it onto a wireless charger and nothing happens, no messages, no acknowledgement that it's even trying to charge. Once this happens, the only way to fix it is a reboot. Once you reboot, it starts wireless charging as normal.

It doesn't stop charging part way through, if you put the phone on the charger it either starts working or nothing!. If it starts charging, it will charge OK until full. So it's not a temperature issue.

We have tried 4 different wireless chargers (a Samsung one, two from Amazon and an in-car one). They all work fine until the phone decides to stop recognising the chargers and then none work.

We have even tried  wireless power sharing from my S23 Ultra - nothing until a reboot.

If we plug in a charging cable, it will start charging OK, but still won't wireless charge.

It can happen at any battery level, we've seen it at 46%, 65%, 85% and 96%.

My S23 ultra uses the same wireless chargers without issue. We still have my wife's S21 and that has never had issues with the same chargers. So I am 100% sure it's not a charger issue.

We are wondering if it's a hardware of software issue. If it's hardware we need to get the phone returned and replaced, if it's a software issue then we can perhaps wait for Samsung to fix it.

Anyone else and similar experience?

[Serious] Notification icons need to be different colors,61,11d4lut,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11d4lut/serious_notification_icons_need_to_be_different/,22,"There was recently an update that went out that changed all of the notifications on my phone to be the same color.

For example, these are the old notifications: [here](https://i.imgur.com/POtNLB9.jpg).

And these are the [new ones](https://i.imgur.com/kE4FDW0.jpg)

Before, it was easy to scan down the list as a whole, pausing my eyes only on the color of the text. Familiarity of what's usually in that list (lets face it, we don't always clear *all* of our notifications) contrasts nicely with what's new to the list, especially when there are so many items I need to scroll down to see all of them. I'm able to memorize its contents with less effort. It was much easier to use. 

On the new color scheme, my old habits of scanning are obsolete. I'm having a difficult time. I've been trying to scan down the left side only to see what app it is, then I read the notification itself. It's a lot to take in. The only way to tell apps apart is a basic shape inside that purple bubble and my vision isn't what it used to be on these high density phone displays.  

I really don't like the change. You probably could have guessed that by now. If this was an A-B test, please dial me down. If this is the new default setting, please reconsider. If there's an easy way to get the colored title text back, even better. But I will still be peaved that it just changed to this without my consent. I still use old reddit for goodness sake.

If you're looking for a better solution, may I suggest slightly tinting the notification bars themself with the app default color. Nothing wrong with a little more variation of color in our lives. You can keep it subtle yet maintained the readability. 

TLDR: my phone is harder to use because of the new UI design",1677478620.0

The S23 is insane for game emulation! Console level graphics Naruto Storm 4 running at 30fps,7,11d1is4,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11d1is4/the_s23_is_insane_for_game_emulation_console/,12,"I am so glad I bought this phone (S23 base 256gb) even with the camera lag issue because it can do one thing iPhone and Pixel phones cannot, and that is Switch Emulation. 

Switch Emulation (3DS and PSP also) is insane on the S23, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and it's GPU has really impressive performance 

Here are 2 gameplay videos I recorded. I just played the game for 20+ minutes while screen recording so towards the end there is thermal throttling with more than 3 characters on the screen. Throughout the 32 minutes of play time it used 5.8% battery.

I was so into the game the 2nd time i accidentally clicked stop and it didn't record but that was the best performance I got too since it was 30 frames the whole time without recording. 

First video I had the wrong audio setting so there is only BGM
https://youtu.be/wX8Jdb0723c

Second video has it all but is after 15 minutes of playing and recording.
https://youtu.be/9GYr0tyq0lA


There are 2 apps that you can choose to use for emulation: 

- EggNS (Paid - need a supporting controller or monthly sub)

- Skyline (Free)

- Skyline Edge (Patreon sub)

Skyline Edge is much more respectable since they built from the ground up using open source code and have been steadily improving game performance at a fast rate. They will at some point I hope overtake EggNS.

EggNS has more support and better frames on most games but that is because they have been around for longer, they began by taking code and profiting off it so they have a bad reputation. 

Personally whatever runs the games better in the end is what I'm going to be using. The EggNS developers have hinted at an iOS release but I'm doubtful it will run well since there are so many restrictions on iOS.

You will then need to follow guides to source your own key files, firmware and game roms. 

Other games I tried on EggNS: 

- Astral Chain 30 fps, it's pretty good but haven't gotten to intense combat yet

- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe starts at 60 fps but it drops to 40 fps

- Super Mario Bros U Deluxe 60 fps whole time

- Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Violet had issues maybe it needs a driver update cause others can run it

- Metroid Prime Remastered 60 fps

So yeah pretty excited to be carrying my S23 and able to play console level games offline for about 1 hour. And still have amazing battery for the rest of the day as well.",1677468631.0

PSA: Turn off RAM Plus...your battery life and performance will thank you,14,11cyflv,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11cyflv/psa_turn_off_ram_plusyour_battery_life_and/,108,"Basically the title. The idea of RAM Plus is great but in practice it works terribly and it will hurt your battery life along with hurting the performance in the meantime. After I got my S23U it was literally the first thing I turned off and multiple people who have also gotten them have been helped in their battery life considerably since I recommended they do this also.

EDIT: Not saying this is going to be universally true for everyone obviously as everyone's needs and demands are different. My personal experiences (and no, I don't take pictures of all stats before and after I make settings changes to my devices) with previous models have shown improvements in performance and battery by both being able to turn it off if it's an option (added in One UI 5.0) or tuning it down to lower GB amounts. Because of those previous experiences it was something I turned off first getting my new devices and friends of mine have had similar improvements especially in battery after I recommended they turn it off.

I understand a lot of this is anecdotal and you can discount it if you so feel inclined but I know my end user experience has been greatly improved by choosing to bypass this feature and I thought it was worth putting out there for others.",1677459637.0

You Know That 5Ghz Band Wifi6 issue most S22/S23 Ultras has been having? I may have found a good Temporary Solution for this.,1,11cqe66,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11cqe66/you_know_that_5ghz_band_wifi6_issue_most_s22s23/,12,"So I've been dealing with this for over a year now, trying everything under the sun to get this to work and I noticed that the majority of the time the issue happens with Asus Routers. And ironically I have one too, an RT-AX86U to be exact. 

So after a lot of research & trial and error, I found myself a good Temporary Solution that has been working for over a week now, with the WiFi signal lagging very briefly on a rare occasion, with maybe one time where I thought the issue came back but the whole internet was down instead 😅.

So here's what I did:

1. No Smart Switch was used to set up my S23 Ultra. Never liked it to be honest. I use Samsung Cloud and Google Drive via Google One to back up everything & I keep all my stuff in the cloud so it was only a re-download of what was needed. And I only brought back only my Messages & Call Log, cuz I'm forgetful 😅. I also manually added my WiFi to my phone, I didn't bring it over. I also cleared it from my Known WiFi Networks as well beforehand.

2. I switched the Router's software from ASUSMerlin back to Stock ASUS software, and updated it to the most STABLE version. Get it from ASUS directly & install it via the web gui.

3. I did both the HARD Factory Reset AND the NORMAL Factory Reset after I updated the router. There's two versions of it apparently. I did the version where you are physically pressing buttons to do it, and then I did the normal one on the Web Gui. Look up Hard Factory Reset *insert router name here* and it'll give you the way to do it for that particular version.

4. Went through Initial Router Set-up normally. Kept the same name & password, **stick to WPA2 security, you'll see why in a second**

5. *on the phone* Turned on Developer Settings on the phone, turned on Wifi Safe Mode.

6. Settings, Connections, WiFi, tap on the 3 Dots on the top right and choose Intelligent WiFi & turn off Prioritize Real-time Data.

7. *in Web Gui for the Router* Turn off 802.11ax/WiFi 6 mode. It's in Wireless. Make sure you do it for both bands (the first section will be which band you're editing, choose accordingly)

8. I actually kept on the 160 Mhz option for the 5Ghz because I want my speed dammit. Hasn't affected anything.

9. Switched my DNS (including IPv6) out of Cloudflare to a different DNS, I used Google. IPv4 is in the WAN section, IPv6 is in the IPv6 section (switch only if you actually have that one normally) **I didn't try different DNS options, Google was always my second choice, my focus was NOT using Cloudflare. Try different ones and see, I was always having issues with Cloudflare**

10. **for fun cuz why not** Restart everything. Phone, Router, and Modem if you're feeling fancy. Why? It doesn't hurt so might as well.



That's it. No Phone Mac. No Static IP on the phone. I'm on my 5Ghz Band consistently and it works almost flawlessly. Granted I would love to have Wifi6 available to me so I can get a better router with the 6Ghz Band as an option, but being able to use my 5Ghz in a stable way on my phone when I need that is more important to me. So there we go.",1677440176.0

S23 Ultra Best Camera Setups - Issue with Indoor High Contrast Scenes Though,0,11c2te5,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11c2te5/s23_ultra_best_camera_setups_issue_with_indoor/,0,"Been comparing shots on the Samsung S23 Ultra I just got to my Note 20 Ultra.  As expected, it's not a night and day difference of course.  But in most scenes, the S23 Ultra produces moderately better results with the biggest difference when using Expert Raw in 50MP mode both JPG and RAW output (while the latter is going to be better for post editing.  I imagine 200MP is good too but I'm passing on that large of file size).

I found what I think though is a limitation in the camera software (or sensor).  Hopefully Samsung will fix it in a future update. It is for moderately low light indoor photos (like late afternoon and overcast with no indoor lighting turned on), but where you have a bright scene through the windows (like snowy mountains).  I imagine this happens in any room where you have bright window scene and not a bright room. 

The normal camera on the Note20 Ultra does much better metering and doesn't blow out the scene in the windows.  The S23 Ultra comes very close if using the normal camera in 12MP mode but at best it's equal to the Note in other tests the S23 Ultra totally blew out the window scene where the Note 20 Ultra didn't.  In this test scene it got a little worse in 50MP mode.  Then it gets even worse in Pro mode.  In Expert Raw it is bad too in some circumstances no matter what metering mode you select or exposure setting.  If you are lucky to get a decent shot in Expert Raw you can tweak the RAW output in Adobe lightroom, but it's still not as good as the normal camera mode on both phones! Where as most other shot scenes, the Expert Raw in 50mp mode is superior to the other modes and anything the Note 20 Ultra puts out, but you need to zoom in on the photo to really notice the difference.  (Safe to say if you're a Note 20 Ultra User (or S21/22 Ultra), you're not missing out much as the 200mp sensor in the S23 Ultra is as I expected part modest improvement and part a lot of marketing hype.)

Here's a comparison between normal 12mp camera output on Note 20 and S23 Ultra, then an Adobe Lightroom edited RAW image coming from Expert Raw on the S23 Ultra in 12mp mode.  

So the end conclusion is that in the current state of the software, on the S23 Ultra, for high contrast moderate natural light indoor shots like this, you are best just using the standard 12mp auto mode in the regular camera app. Whereas in most other situations you get the best quality with reasonable file size shooting in Expert Raw at 50mp.

I decided not to keep it since i just can't get happy with it and have to trust my gut feeling here.

When i purchased, I paid just over £800 including a bunch of discounts and a trade in discount of £290 for my existing phone. (Which i have not yet sent to them)

I spoke to Samsung about returning the S23 Ultra , and they said they would refund me the £800 when i return the phone, and since i would not be sending my S20 to them, would be charged £290 from the trade in team.

I can't get my head around how this would make sense, because in my mind , The £290 discount would only be applicable if i kept the device , but since i'm cancelling altogether, Can't see how that is logical?

Am i getting this wrong?

Avoid Pixel phones,21,11bhlok,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11bhlok/avoid_pixel_phones/,58,"I've had my pixel 7 for under a month, and I've had to contact customer support on a few things, firstly my 3 months free YouTube premium to which they stated if you have already used any free trial then you cannot use this. I told them I have used a free trial but there's an option for another free month to which I have activated and sent the screenshot stating that isn't the issue. They told me well we can't do anything about it. 

My next issue was the trade in services and how my phone got rejected for screen burns, I sent them the pictures clearly showing there are no burns. They said they have escalated it to the highest tier and their response was because it has been returned we can't do much but here you go a free 40£ gift card. If this is there responses a month into my new phone what will it be when my phone experiences any hardware or software issues. To put it simply I don't trust this brand and i will not purchase a pixel phone anytime in the near future.

I will be switching back to Samsung as it's more reliable, has better stock apps, consistent pictures, quick menu and widgets are inconveniently too large with no added benefit, Google photos and gallery's are light years behind Samsung gallery in terms of customisation, Google keyboard and Microsoft as well. I've had to download a couple of apps because Samsung had irmt stock Google didn't for example Samsung pass, background media player, music player, that's actually good and customisable, Samsung notes, if your screen is off you can't hold to reduce the volume you have to tap it to reduce it or turn the screen on to hold it - I use this alot when I'm sleeping so it's a daily issue but exclusive to me. Not sure why WiFi and data are not separate options and sometimes weirdly turns on WiFi and connects me even though I've had it off, I had to install a new app that allows me to add documents or pictures as a shortcut on the home screen

As for what's good from the pixel: it's smoooth, above average battery life, I like the ss features, when the picture is good it's amazing, DND works amazing - miles ahead of Samsung, others I can't think of as of right now. 

All in all its a great phone but compared to Samsung I definitely have missed a lot of features and the customer service with Samsung is top notch compared to Google and this is why I am making the move, ofcourse backed with the downsides that I have with the phone.",1677319912.0

It's sad that Samsung's Exynos processor failed so bad. Especially since my S10, when it was an amazing and powerful SoC.

But Samsung burnt European users with that chip (incapable to keep up with the competition, including system lags) it is questionable whether they will gain back their trust and mine.

I feel Samsung should acquire Qualcomm and let their own failed attempt of making an own chip go.

Rest of the world (RoW) doesn't have any idea what we had to deal with (as Europeans (for the past 3 years, we had been the guinea pig with their Exynos attempt and it failed lately.

Samsung generally should learn from it and make one chip for their phone anywhere else in the world and make a firm decision on what to do (Apple's own SoC as an example) and not create two classes of users on the same phone.

I know this might sound like a rant, but I hope it doesn’t.  I would just like to provide my personal experience of why I no longer trust Samsung Mobile and then ask for your thoughts.

  

  \-	[Samsung Note 7 Recall](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-galaxy-note-7-return-exchange-faq)

2 (iirc?) recalls.  1 attempt to fix it then 1 to refund. This is a bad sign of poor internal processes.

  

\-	[Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Bricked](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-software-update-vi3-bricking-smartwatches/) 

Both my wife’s watch and mine bricked by a bad firmware update.  Out of warranty and Samsung Philippines initially refused to repair it even though Samsung firmware bricked it!  Had to raise this higher up the food chain to resolve but took weeks.

  

\-	Samsung Fold Screen Reliability

My Fold 3 main screen failed at 18 months old.  Anecdotal evidence from friends on social media seemed to suggest this is common, usually somewhere between 18 months to 24 months.  Some of my friends with Samsung folding screen devices have even had 2 different models and they have had both different models fail in this timeframe.  As it’s outside of warranty Samsung want at least $700 to repair it presumably so it can fail again at some point in the future?

   

This has now left me with 6 Samsung tags that appear to be useless as I’m not likely buying another Samsung phone.

  

Would be interesting to hear in the comments from people who have had any Samsung folding phone for a long period (at least 18 months?) to see how they feel about their reliability.

  

\-	[Samsung S23 Screen Wrinkle](https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-screen-wrinkle) 

(I’ve not suffered this, included as evidence of continued failure)

Although this is still new and no one really knows for sure how many are affected, it’s clearly a defect and the excuse from Samsung is on par with Apples “your holding it wrong”.  This is not a cheap phone and neither is the waterproofing/dustproofing process so, why has it only appear on these new models?  Manufacturing or design defect?  It doesn’t matter how minor it is, it’s still a defect and under UK law (at least when I was at school) a product had to be “free from minor defect” or could be returned.

  

Samsung have cost me well over $2000 in wasted money (lest we not also forget time!) and peripherals I no longer have a use for.  Given this I don’t think I can trust Samsung anymore as either their design, manufacture or QA (or combination) just seem to be failing and these are the issues I’m aware of, I’m guessing there might be more. 

  

How many of you feel like you can still trust Samsung Mobile?

For me and from many reports, this happens on all WiFi 6 networks, at home and at work and outside at the mall. It is not an issue with some particular configuration or router. It is an issue with the S23 Ultra WiFi software/driver and how it handles WiFi 6 networks. It does not seem happen on WiFi 5 or WiFi 6E from the reports and my experience, so switching to either will resolve the issue until Samsung fixes it.

S22 was the worst decision ever,0,11atpz3,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11atpz3/s22_was_the_worst_decision_ever/,73,"I got the S22 for my birthday in december 2022 and I feel like I made my parents waste 700€. My previous phone (2019-2022) was S10e and before that an S4 so, although I like iPhone better, I'm more comfortable with Samsung but this phone (S22) doesn't feel like an upgrade in any way. Here are the 2 main things I suffer the most with this phone:

1. Selfie camera is disgusting. In social media apps (Whatsapp, bereal, ig...) if there's low light, the pic will turn out grey, it doesn't capture any color and my face has patches of my skin tone color in a grey background. Quality is awful. 

2. Charging takes forever. I don't know why but  I cannot use my phone while charging because it doesn't charge at all, it just maintains the same % or charges 1%/5min. Literally today I was doing breakfast while watching YT in the background, my phone started at 24% and in the course of exactly an hour, it only charged up to 31%. That's 7% in 60 minutes = 1% every 8 minutes. And I use the cable that comes with the phone.

Overall experience: As a regular person, not an expert, not a computer fan etc... This phone hasn't given me any new things, or improved in almost any way what I had in the S10e. I feel like the only thing I've noticed is the smoothness of a brand new phone vs a 3year old phone with tons of pics, apps in there which isn't really a point for the S22 because that's the purpose of buying a new phone. But even with barely 3 months of use, it still has its moments of running slow and bugging itself. 

As I said in the begging of the post, I feel like I (my parents) wasted 700€ and that I'm going to be stuck with this crap the next 3-5 years. If anyone out here has had the same experience as me, please share it so that way I know that I'm not alone or crazy. And if your experience with the S22 has been the complete opposite of this, share it too and hopefully give me tips on how I can get 100% of S22.",1677251680.0

How to Enable Cast Support in Media Output Switcher (One UI 5.1),1,11aqifo,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11aqifo/how_to_enable_cast_support_in_media_output/,0,"The One UI 5.1 changelogs specifically called out ""**Media output for Wi-Fi speakers**"" feature stating: *""If you want to continue listening to music on Wi-Fi speakers via Spotify Connect and built-in Chromecast, just open Media Output from the Quick Access Toolbar, not from the Music app""*

But after getting the Galaxy S23+ running One UI 5.1 I was disappointed when I first tried to switch playback from my phone to Google Home speakers using the 'Media Output' button in notification shade. It showed all my Google Cast devices, but it took several seconds to switch output to them and it didn't have any of the rich cast experience with album art and song information, just showed text 'Default Media Receiver' or something.

But tonight I accidently discovered a non-obvious setting page where you can change it from what appears to be Miracast mirroring, to actually use the Google Cast protocol. Apps need to be updated to support it, but it works great! Think it's only YouTube and YouTube Music at the moment.

**Instructions (screenshots here:** [**https://imgur.com/a/hG8QEMP**](https://imgur.com/a/hG8QEMP)**)**

1. Click on 'Media Output' in notification shade
2. Click the 'Gear' in top-right
3. Click on Wi-Fi speaker playback preference
4. Select 'Casting' to use Google Cast instead of the default 'Mirroring'

If the electricity cut, use the battery, but don't charge it, until its under (I don't know) 30%.

As someone who is constantly trying to capture videos of my cats all day long, P7 Pro was just not a great device. Don't get me wrong, if the lighting was good, videos were decent. But most of my indoor shots had a lot of noise. Evening and night time videos were average at best unless I had got some good lighting setup.

Another issue I had was overheating and battery life, if I was shooting 4k videos, the battery just didn't last as long. Editing videos on the phone wasn't that great either... Tensor's subpar performance really made editing slower and the device would just get hot quickly. I saw that warning multiple times where it would say that the device is too hot to continue shooting and it had barely been 5 mins of 4K 30fps recording.

I came from iPhone 13 Pro before P7 Pro so all of these issues with video recording and performance annoyed me a lot. I didn't want to go back to Apple ecosystem because let's just say that I got bored from iOS and wanted to experience Android again.

I preordered S23 Ultra on the launch day and have had the device for about a week now. I'm really happy with the performance and video quality so far. Although I'm not a professional videographer, I have tried shooting some 8K clips of my cats, and I really like the end result, and even uploaded it to YouTube. I've been able to record 4K 60 fps for longer than 10 mins, and have not really seen any overheating warnings so far. Phone has just gotten warm once when I downloaded like 40GB of data over 5G network in one go.

Video editing feels smoother and a better display with S Pen really helps here with precision. I'm mostly editing for reels/shorts, and I've been very happy with the results so far. Battery life is much better and I charge my device once every day.

Only thing I would say that I miss from Pixel 7 Pro is shutter speed. Samsung is not too bad but I definitely feel the difference and before anyone points out, I've already installed the camera assistant app and turned on the faster shutter setting. But that's just for shutter lag, not shutter speed.

If my cats are moving too much, I am mostly taking a video and not a picture, so the shutter speed factor doesn't bother me as much. S23 Ultra is just a better overall camera experience for me.

I don't do any gaming on my phone so I can't say much about in that area.

Overall, I'm a happy S23 Ultra user.

Close to 9 hours of screen on time with the S23 Ultra.,22,11a88aj,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11a88aj/close_to_9_hours_of_screen_on_time_with_the_s23/,10,"So I was undecided whether to upgrade to the S23 Ultra after it was announced. My S21 Ultra was in pretty good shape (aside from a cracked back) 

Never had any stuttering problems. Never was sluggish. I didn't even manage to fill up the 256gb capacity within 2 years of use. 

But, after a couple of weeks contemplating, I decided to pull the trigger and get the S23 Ultra.

To be honest, there's not a massive difference between the two phones that hits you in the face. The jump didn't feel anywhere as massive as it did when I went from the S9 plus to the S21 Ultra. 

Except for one aspect. Battery life. I had just gotten close to 9 hours of SoT with Wifi and Bluetooth both on. 

I mostly browsed Reddit, an hour in a half of Youtube, about 2 hours of gaming and some social media browsing.

This obviously isnt the heaviest of loads, but its the same routine I did with my S21 Ultra, and that phone only lasted me about 6 hours, 7 the most.

I just wanted to share to you guys how the S23 Ultra's battery holds up to usage mentioned above",1677185120.0

My Experience After 1 Week From An iPhone 12 Pro Max,15,11a7k94,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11a7k94/my_experience_after_1_week_from_an_iphone_12_pro/,47,"I recently switched from the iPhone 12 Pro Max and made a post about my switch and some folks said I will be back to using an iPhone after and that I am in a honeymoon phase and blah blah blah. Well one week later, I have never been happier about making the switch. This has been my experience so far after a week.

Battery Life: I started out with a decent  SOT of around 5 hours. I have to say this is not really bad and as someone who works a lot and does not mind charging my phone once or twice a day, SOT is sufficient for me. But I decided to see if I could push it further. So I decided to optimize my phone and here's how I did it:

1) I never charge the phone when the phone is hot. This is very important even than turning on to protect the battery.

2) I also realized adaptive brightness was overestimating the brightness I needed. So I set up modes and routines for the times I get home and around the times I sleep. Around the time I get home, my At home mode sets the brightness to 4% which is more than enough for me. Around the time I sleep, I have a routine set to turn off the phone if I plug the charger in to keep the phone cool and it also turns to protect the battery on to keep the phone's battery from stress overnight.

3) I also make sure to close apps I am not using anymore so the ram doesn't try to keep it open + RAM uses a significant amount of battery.

After doing this SOT went from 5 hours to 9-11 hours depending on the use which involved watching Netflix(the screen is so good lol), using social media, reading, etc.

Camera: 

The camera out of the box was great but it somehow didn't process some pics properly imo. But somehow it's like it got better overnight. The pics coming out of the phone are crazy good now not even kidding. Some Portraits shots  I took the other day of my kid look like they were professionally photographed. I can't explain what I did to improve the camera so much but one thing I noticed is that the more lighting the better. Also being stable when taking a photo really helps. won't decide to go into shutter lag because that's a whole post of its own.

Other:

Apps run smoothly with like one lag because I have labs turned on (which they did mention could cause some lags), SPen has been amazing been using it more times than I can count, pop out the pen, write something on AOD, pin it, and never forget.

 Review after a week:  I still think this is the best phone out there. With all the features it provides. There are many other things that I could go on and on about the phone but that will make this post too long. Not saying it's perfect, I don't expect it to be and after one week it's one of the best purchases I have made in a while.

PS: One thing I really dislike about the phone is Samsung emojis. Pure shit. Thank God Android is highly customizable. I currently use iPhone emojis on my S23 Ultra. Please leave any more tips that can help me better optimize my phone. Thanks",1677183468.0

I have 1 single routine, which is ""Night Time"". Set to turn on at 12am-9am, which will trigger a bunch of stuff (DND, Night filter, etc.).

Previously on OneUI 4, when it was just ""Routines"", I was able to just use a quick toggle to disable all routines if I decide that I don't want my ""night time"" routine to be running at say 2am, then toggle it again to turn it on when I want it back on.

Then with OneUI 5, they made it ""Modes & Routines"", and the quick toggle stopped working. So I had to go into the Modes & Routines app to disable/enable the routine whenever I want to.

Now with OneUI 5.1, they once again messed with it. If I disable the routine when it's running, I can't re-enable it for some reason.

This is so frustrating, it was working fine in OneUI 4, why did they add modes and screwed everything up.",1677182148.0

Recently, I made the switch from my trusty Samsung Galaxy S10 to the newer, more advanced S23 Ultra. While I love my new device, I couldn't help but notice that my S10 is still in great condition and fully functional, except for its battery life. So, I've been thinking about ways to repurpose it and make the most out of it.

I'm curious to hear how other people have repurposed their older smartphones. Have you found any creative uses for your old devices? Maybe you've integrated them into a work desk setup or found a way to use them as a security camera or music player.

Personally, I'm considering using my S10 as a dedicated music player or a bedside clock with an alarm feature. I've also heard of people using their old devices as a home security camera, a remote control for their smart home devices, or even as a backup phone in case of emergency.

If anyone has any other suggestions or ideas, I would love to hear them. It would be great to repurpose my S10 in a way that adds value to my daily routine and reduces e-waste.

Thanks in advance for your input!",1677172805.0

I'm in a bunch of different subreddits related to Samsung and their products. I am constantly seeing people say something to the effect of ""Great products but the worst customer service of any company"". 

I've been using their products almost exclusively for the last 10 years and am not the easiest customer in terms of expectations. Meaning I'll send my phone in for a repair/service more than a few times over the course of that time. I have never had a bad experience with them. My issues always get solved with minimal headache. And I would even say dealing with them is almost always a pleasant experience. There was only one occasion where I was almost let down. Last year, after 4 or 5 months of ownership, I sent in my Z fold 3 to get the main display replaced as it had started to develop little cracks down the center of the crease. But the main display did have accidental damage on it that i caused within the first week of ownership. (a few dead pixels) But the two were not related. After I sent in the phone, they basically said it wouldn't be covered under warranty and they would need $500 to replace the display.  I called Samsung after seeing that email and complained about how the two issues are unrelated and the agent said that she would try to see if she can get that point across and get the screen replaced under warranty. I wasn't expecting much after we got off the phone since i had been hearing so many people complain about their customer service. Anyway, I got an email a few hours later stating that the repair was made under warranty and the phone was being overnighted to me.

Since this post is much longer than I had anticipated, I won't explain the pleasant experience I had with them over the past few days. Just Know that as somebody who deals with Samsung customer service at least once a year, I have never been let down. And I would even say that of all the companies i have dealt with, Samsung, IN MY EXPERIENCE, has had by far the best customer service.",1677171197.0

S23 Ultra's WiFi problem seems to happen only on WiFi 6 routers; no issues if using WiFi 5,34,119tp4j,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/119tp4j/s23_ultras_wifi_problem_seems_to_happen_only_on/,82,"So like many people, I had the issue of my 23 Ultra getting the ""connected without Internet"" error when connected to my WiFi 6 router (TP-Link EX221-G2u), forcing the phone to default to mobile data (thank God I have 160GB a month).

Suspecting it had something with the WiFi 6 protocol, I swapped back to my old WiFi 5 router. The phone has since maintained the connection for more than 24 hours, where before it would drop the WiFi 6 connection within an hour or two.

It's my only WiFi 6 device; all my other WiFi 5 devices connect just fine to the WiFi 6 router (defaulting to the WiFi 5 protocol). None of the other setting tweaks shared by others seem to work.

Does anyone know if there is a way to force the S23 Ultra to operate solely on the WiFi 5 5GHz protocol, through a WiFi 6 router?

Edit: added my exact router model. Also, managed to disable 802.11ax (WiFi 6) on my router so it defaults to 802.11ac (WiFi 5), and it's been very stable so far. But it's just a workaround for now and not a true fix because those of us with this problem cannot use our phones to their advertised potential.",1677145016.0

The specs are:
- Processor: Octa-core (1x3.00 GHz Cortex-X2 & 3x2.50 GHz Cortex-A710 & 4x1.80 GHz Cortex-A510) ( here i had some doubts is this the snapdragon 8 gen 1? )

- battery 8000mAh
- Cameras: 13mp 6mp back, 12mp front
- 11 inch screen

Just got my S23Ultra and was very excited to get it with all the discounts samsung was giving to customers in Canada.

I think it has to be a bad wifi card. Anyone else has had similar issue with S23Ultra?

I use Google Nest router and with my S20FE I never had a connection problem. 

I would appreciate if new owners of S23Ultra commented on their wifi experience. For the price we pay, this issue shouldnt exist! 🥹


UPDATE** - Thank you all for your kind and quick responses. I did restart the router and modem and the phone and seems most of the time to be ok now.

Looking for any reviews of the quality of Bellroy cases. I've never purchased them in the past but their case for the S23 Ultra (in the Terracotta color) is intriguing to me.

**s20+**  
I just love the feeling. Mine has a case because I don't want to break if if I drop it, but without the case it's the most comfortable phone I ever had. Size is perfect, rounded edges are very comfy to hold. If it had dynamic refresh and better camera, it would be perfect.

**iPhone 13 Pro Max**  
I have this because of work. I hardly use it because the flat edges/sides are so uncomfortable to hold in my hands. Plus it's extremely big and heavy. Maybe I'm biased because I don't like Apple products, but I would very much prefer a smaller iPhone, can't really understand why someone would want the bigger version of the phones besides to have the best.

**s23+**  
I so much wanted to like it. I don't care about the S-Pen at all, so my first thought was getting the s23+, although I would love to have the same screen (1-120hz) and cameras as the Ultra. But the flat edges... feels exactly like the iPhone 13 Pro Max... too uncomfortable to hold! And the fact that it feels mid-flagship due to the features... I don't know. IMO the plus and U should each share more similarities in terms of hardware, except the shape and S-Pen.

**s23U**  
I was surprised, it is as big as my S20+ without a case. It means phones are not getting bigger, but a bit smaller. I'm not a fan of the squared shape, but the edges are soft/rounded like the s20+ which makes it comfy to hold in your hands. And because it's not actually bigger, for my hands it's perfect. I just dislike that it has the S-Pen (could live without it), and the overall squared shape is not my cup of tea.

I'm not sure which one to buy. I'm really torn between the plus and ultra. So much that I'm considering skipping this generation completely. My s20+ (march 2020) still feels good as new. I like to change my phone every 2-3 years but can't find enough reasons yet.

So rn in Europe they have a sale going on where you can get the 1TB variant for the price of a 512GB variant, this would mean it would cost €1579, the guy who helped me then asked if I had a phone I could trade in and I told him I just sold my iPhone but I had an old LG G6 with broken screen with me as my backup. He said he could take it in and provide another €200 discount if I did that (for a phone that's worth absolutely nothing). Then he asked me if I were a student (I am) which was another €157 discount.

S23 Light-Mode Experiences,124,119ishd,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/119ishd/s23_lightmode_experiences/,95,"Going to keep it brief as I can. Testing Light Mode on the base S23 which claims ~30-40% power/heat savings for ~10% performance off the top on the S23.

**Performance:** I cannot force a scenario where I notice the 10% performance hit. I've even tested it with Skyline Emulator (something that pushes the SOC to the max, yet Samsung does not detect as a game so light mode appears to be intact).

**Battery:** A definite boost but its within a range that might seem placebo but seems a bit too good to be just that. ~5-10% increase which on the S23 which already had solid battery life is actually a good bit of time. I think the impact to battery life with DeX usage and while multitasking in general was pretty noticeable 

**Heat:** Biggest benefit by miles. Android Auto with GPS (wired and wireless) ends up ice-cold, DeX and multitasking (was already not so bad) doesn't even warm it up, really it's only tasks that kick the GPU on that will heat up the phone anymore.

**Conclusion / my 2-cents:** If you can't specify a need for the max clockspeeds (excluding gaming when light mode disables itself) then you should absolutely be using light mode, or at the very least try it out for a few days. Outside of Geekbench I absolutely never used/felt the top 10% of this SD8G2(fg).. but I definitely feel these efficiency benefits.",1677111474.0

SmartThings/Location+Wifi scanning/Modes and Routines,0,119gfgx,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/119gfgx/smartthingslocationwifi_scanningmodes_and_routines/,7,"So i'm moving into the new age and i guess i'm questioning how things work when i switch to automations for home appliances/networking etc.

Generally on my phone, i don't have bluetooth, wifi, or location enabled since they drain battery quite effectively. Usually i'm rocking the mobile data *exclusively* since i'm on unlimited.Only turn on location when using maps, and bluetooth works by itself when i use my earbuds.

What i want to do is have my phone switch networks when i'm in/out the house (using connect/disconnect from network as trigger) and turn off/reverse location and mobile data toggles. This i already have configured.

BUT here is the big question. In order to have this work autonomously, i'll probably need to have GPS, Bluetooth, WIFI and mobile data all turned on when i'm outside... Right?

I've noticed there are settings for certain apps pertaining location scanning (high and low precision) and also wifi/bluetooth scanning even if they're both turned Off.

...How does this all mesh together? Do i need to run BT/WIFI/GPS all day?   
Because that's probably a deal-breaker.   
But if there's some automation i can write, or if low-usage background processes are adequate to determine my location for using smart home 'things', i'd love to know.

Finally Europe gets snapdragon. Pre order S23. Physically, the device is amazing. Great display, great speakers, great size, can remove almost all the bloatware. 
But the camera…is terrible.

***12 mp photos*** - great in good lighting. Grainy and blurry as shit indoors.

***50 mp photos*** - WTF. Takes 5 seconds to process and turns up hdr and saturation to a 100 with scene recognition off. This can be resolved by installing the camera assistant and setting the shutter speed to prioritise speed over quality and turning on the scene recognition. When you prioritise speed, it doesn’t apply the post processing. But the hit to quality is noticeable.

***Shutter lag*** - I didn’t think this would be an issue. But it is. Tried to sort this out via the camera assistant, but still blurry photos of my kid. I did a side by side comparison by taking photos from both, the s23 and my iPhone and the iPhone took 12 photos while the s23 took 6.
The lag is unbearable. 

My wife tried to take some photos from the car and they were all blurry and the focus was all over the place. 
Never happens with the iPhone. 

**ExpertRAW** - 

***50 mp***- Horrible over processed , green tinted photos. Akin to non raw 50 mp ones. It’s supposed to be raw ? With little to no processing. It’s especially horrible at night. Raises all shadows, saturation and HDR 100%

https://youtu.be/mVrO53ABpPk

***12 mp*** - fine again. 

Tried toggling auto hdr in settings. Didn’t help. 

***Video*** - 

Always starts off choppy, but smoothes out eventually. 
Also notice the lights in the videos taken at night to be flickering a lot. 

All this over processing also means I never know how a photo is going to turn out. I’m looking at something and expect to take a photo of what I see. 10 seconds later, you have a photo that is over processed to shit with it looking nothing like what I see. 

Maybe I got a dud. 

I have raised a return and will be keeping my iPhone. 
Saw a bunch of reviews praising the cameras but am left disappointed. 
Would get a pixel if Google started selling them officially in my country.

Are there Galaxy S23 Ultra 'must-use' features that I might have overlooked when I ported from my Note 10?,3,11953ye,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11953ye/are_there_galaxy_s23_ultra_mustuse_features_that/,8,"I've had a Note 10 since about the time it released in 2019, and it finally bit the bullet and I upgraded to the S23 Ultra (I can't live without an S-Pen). When it got my new phone setup it ported over all the settings from my Note 10 and all the apps, which was a wonderfully easy transition.

However, everything looks and feels more or less the same. That's fine, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything. When I moved from the Note 2 to a S8 Edge, it added the edge panel which was annoying at first  but eventually grew on me.  Then the Note 10 added Google Assistant and some other features.  I never used Bixby, but I know some people love it.

I want to make sure there aren't 'must use' features on the Note 23 that I've overlooked by porting over my phone settings from the Note 10.  I don't really live in the phone world in terms of new releases and things like that.  I just needed a phone and the S23 Ultra came out at the right time.

So are there cool tricks, cool features, etc. that I need to make sure I'm not missing out on?

Samsung Shop (India) Really messed up my order!,3,118vstc,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/118vstc/samsung_shop_india_really_messed_up_my_order/,7,"So I pre-ordered the S23 Ultra along with the grip case, Watch 5 pro, Buds 2 pro and Screen protector on 5th. The watch 5 pro had a delivery date of 7th Feb. I scheduled the buds 2 pro to deliver on 16th Feb. Other items being a pre-order, it was expected to start shipping from 17th Feb. Weird thing about the case and the screen protector was that it's shipping was to start from 17th but delivery date was for 16th!!

So here's the day by day timeline so far on what followed.
7th Feb - As expected the Watch 5 pro got delivered. I didn't have an android at the time to set it up since I was still in the iPhone.

16th Feb - My buds 2 pro was supposed to be shipped by now and it was still showing confirmed on the app. Whole day passed and they were not delivered.

17th Feb - My S23 Ultra got shipped with a delivery date for 18th. But the grip case and screen protector were still not packed. Same case with the buds as well. I called up Samsung to enquire and they assured it will be delivered on 18th.

18th Feb - Got my phone and I was super excited. The whole day went in setting up the phone. During the later half I checked the app for status on the remaining 3 items and they were still not packed. I called up Samsung again and now they were telling they will register a Complaint. I told the guy why was a wrong commitment given and they had no answer. They told me it would be sorted it 24hrs. Since I didn't have a case, I ordered a ringke case from Amazon
 
19th Feb - Same status of order not packed. I got my Ringke case though.
 
20th Feb - I called up Samsung again and they telling their teams weren't working on Sunday so nobody was able to look at the issue.

21st Feb - Samsung finally started packing the order but split them into 3 different shipments.

22nd Feb - Recieved the Grip Case and Screen Protector. Yet to receive the Buds since it's delivery date is 23rd.

I think Samsung forgot to place the order till I escalated to their support since I got no communication from them even if there was a delay. Samsung didn't even have the courtesy to do that. The invoice dates found in my screen protector and case box are dated on 21st Feb which means i dont think they have accounted for the pre-orders properly.

Sure I have shitty haptics, unusable night photography, video and no good zoom and a few software hiccups here and there. 

Even compared to a S22U my friend has though, I wouldn't say the experience was of a different world. Night photography even though way better, it was still a smartphone photo and unusable other than to send to a friend. Same with the display,  it's just a bit better than mine. Performance difference I couldn't really tell other than the phone being a bit snappier. I suppose the S23 base model won't be that much better than the S22U. 

Am I missing some aspect of the flagship experience?

Very Sleek, the camera works great and the phone is very powerful. Have to say it's probably the best phone I've owned so far.

I was looking into some newer models though just window shopping to see any interesting features the newer phones have. Until I found out Samsung removed one of it's core features.

The micro SD slot. No phone past the 20 had a micro SD slot. Like wtf? Why? The micro SD slot is one of Samsung's most useful features. I never cared what size phone I got because I always have a 128gb micro SD card that I've been using since my S7. 

I just think it's such a stupid thing to remove. Out of all things to take out they take out the microsd slot? I don't want to use cloud based storage. 

It's been 3 generations and they haven't brought it back. So it's safe to say that the feature is gone for good.

Why are T-Mobile employees so slimy?,0,118j0j0,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/118j0j0/why_are_tmobile_employees_so_slimy/,12,"I wanted to buy a Samsung Galaxy S23 through [samsung.com](https://samsung.com) using T-Mobile as a carrier. I saw that for the 256GB version, the price was $859.99, and with taxes it went to roughly $923. I was about to buy it until I was directed to a webpage were I was given the option to upgrade my line, or add a new line. I wanted neither but that was not an option, plus I did not remember my T-Mobile pin so I just exited and decided to go to buy it at a T-Mobile store.

I arrive at the store and the sale almost gets finalized until the inform me that, with taxes, the price is $962. I ask why the price is higher than the website's price and they tell me that the 256GB version is $100 more expensive, whereas in the website it's only $60 more expensive. I cancel the deal and I go to another store to see if I can get a price that matches the website's. The representative at the other T-Mobile location tells me that with taxes, the price is $923. They also tell me that they cover the shipping and $923 is the final figure, hence matching the webiste's price. I agree to the deal and 40 minutes later I see a charge on my credit card that is $962. I call customer support and they tell me that there is a $35 support fee that comes with upgrading my line, which is mandatory. I did not see it on the website because I never got past that webpage.

In hindsight, the first representative lied as well by making it seem that the extra charge was due to samsung, not T-Mobile. Ironically, his lies are what ruined the deal for him. The second representative was more shrewd in her craft and got me. I would have paid the support fee regardless, but price obfuscation gave me a bad taste in my mouth. Next time I go to an electronic store, I will ask them questions and try out their product with no intention of buying it from them and buying it online instead.

It just stays off until it feels like working again, could be an hour, 2 days, or a minute it doesn’t have any limit.

Pre Orders are literally pointless.,0,117vq39,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/117vq39/pre_orders_are_literally_pointless/,18,"That's not even an exaggeration.

I pre-ordered an S23+ on 2nd Feb. Still have no actual ETA as to when I'll get it.

What is the actual point of pre-ordering a device when you get it weeks AFTER it's general release?
The entire purpose of pre-ordering is so that you can put yourself in front of the front of the queue on release day.

What's more is they try to act like Online Exclusive colours take longer. How? Even IF they were specifically made to order, it wouldn't take 3-4 weeks to assemble and ship. Even IF they were customised with engraving and things like that on top of assembly to order, that still wouldn't take that long.
It's a COLOUR. literally a different casing around the same internals.

Customer service are good for nothing other than summarising ""terms & conditions"", they don't help at all.

Why provide the ability to pre-order when it's genuinely faster to drive to any 3rd party retailer and buy it on the release date.

To be clear: I'm in Australia, I ordered the Graphite colour, and I paid outright.

So they have $1700+ and literally cannot provide me with an indication as to when I'll receive the goods in exchange for the money they've had in their account for WEEKS.

Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 Review - An Apple User's Perspective,36,117nr45,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/117nr45/galaxy_book3_pro_360_review_an_apple_users/,25,"I've had the Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 For almost 3 weeks now, and I wanted to share my thoughts and answer your questions. 

As a point of comparison, my personal laptop is a 2021 14"" MacBook Pro. I'm also very deep in the Apple bubble and was interested in how Samsung's matching some of their integrations with its own ecosystem. 

Disclaimers:

* This is a review unit loaned to me by Samsung, but all thoughts are completely my own and haven't been run by anyone before posting.
* This is an engineering sample, so some of my comments may be fixed in final retail units. 
_________

# Summary - 8/10

- Build quality, Display and Keyboard are fantastic. 
- Trackpad is massive, but some weird tracking inconsistencies let it down.
- SPen is great if that's something you need. 
- Battery is good. Not outstanding, but good enough. 
- Ecosystem is the best it's been, but a little inconsistent at times.
- Speakers, webcam, fingerprint scanner are ok, but could definitely use some improvement. 

_________

# Build Quality - 9.5/10

* This thing is very solidly built. There's very little chassis flex or creaking. Nothing feels like it's going to fall off or break. 
* Only real gripe is with the screen. There's a little bit of flex because of how slim it is. It's not enough to bend while you're trying to open the laptop or anything, but it is enough that you can click the trackpad through the screen if you grip it hard enough in just the right spot. But again, I don't have a final retail unit, so take my experience with a grain of salt. 

# Display - 9/10

* To my eye it looks significantly brighter than my MBP's screen.
* Saturation feels like it's cranked up a little. I like it, but I don't know enough about color accuracy to make a judgement there. There are other color profiles you can choose in settings if that's more your preference. 
* Black are deep thanks to OLED, and it doesn't suffer from [light bloom](https://imgur.com/a/pEIigdQ) like my MBP does. The camera does exaggerate the effect a little, but it's still very noticeable in person. 
* 16:10 is a very welcome change. It does mean you have letterboxing, but the tradeoff for everyday use is worth it IMO. 
* I'm not too fond of the rounded corners. It cuts into the UI a little, and while it's typically in title bars and the taskbar, it feels out of place. 
* There's a massive chin below the screen that makes it look cheap.
* The hinge is wobbly. Unsure if this is just something with my unit, but it's something that really annoyed me while trying to use the laptop. 

# SPen - 10/10

* There's practically zero latency when using the SPen. 
* There's a good amount of friction when writing. It's not quite pen on paper, but it's far from the plastic on glass feeling that a lot of styluses fall into.
* The SPen itself feels a little hollow. Doesn't impact functionality at all, it just feels a little cheap in the hand. 
* This is very nitpicky, but the button on the side of the SPen is on the rounded edge and I'd rather it were on the flat edge. 
* It mounts to some magnets on the back of the screen. It's ok if you're just looking for a place to keep it without it rolling away, but it's not staying on there in your bag. 

# Keyboard - 10/10

* I **LOVE** this keyboard. I recognize that I'm in the minority, but this reminds me a lot of Apple's butterfly keyboard which was by far my favorite keyboard of all time as far as typing experience goes (durability is a whole other topic). 
* They keys are definitely on the shallower side of the spectrum. I don't have a way of accurately measuring it, but if I had to guess it's around 1 mm of travel. 
* Despite the low travel, it maintains a fair bit of tactility. I never found myself guessing if I'd actually pressed a key or not. 
* The keys are a nice size with enough separation between them to not be an issue. 
* It has a numpad if you're into that, but it's [not a standard layout](https://i.imgur.com/coaFfse.jpg). I found it a little frustrating to use because I kept missing the 0 and Enter keys, but I'm sure you'd get used to it. 
* The keyboard deck is solid, I haven't noticed any flexing. The keys are also very stable, no noticeable wobbling. 

# Touchpad - 6/10

* It's massive. There's no other way to put it. [Here it is compared to an S23 Ultra](https://i.imgur.io/SfpM9Z4_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium). If youre' into large trackpads, this thing is fantastic. 
* The size does take a little bit of getting used to when you're typing. It does have decent palm rejection, but it's not perfect. There is a shortcut on the function row to disable the touchpad, which might be useful during longer typing sessions.
* Good surface texture. 
* I had a weird issue where the first ~1 cm of any movement would be ignored. Not sure if this is part of the palm rejection algorithm, but it's **very** annoying. I hope this can get fixed in a software update, it's easily the worst part of using this laptop. 
* Windows gestures are still not as fluid as macOS gestures. They're miles better than they were a few years ago, but it still feels like they're one step behind. 
* I wish this was a haptic trackpad. Because of its size, the force you need to use to click varies wildly based on where you click. I may be spoiled by my MBP's trackpad, but being able to click anywhere with the same amount of force and feedback is very underrated. 

# Speakers - 7/10

* They're loud enough and produce a clean sound, but they're not going to win any awards. I've definitely heard worse speakers out there, but I've also heard better. 
* There's next to no bass. 

# Battery - 7/10

* It's enough to barely get through a workday with light use, but anything beyond that and you'll likely need to top up halfway through.
* As I'm typing this, I'm sitting at 68% with 4h 41m remaining. I've lost about 20% over the past hour and a half. 
* As a note, I did have my brightness cranked way up during my use; I'm sure being more conscious of your brightness would make the battery last significantly longer. 

# Performance and Heat - ?/10

* I haven't really had a chance to push this thing to its limits; my heavy workloads are enough to require dedicated workstations/clusters, which only leaves lighter everyday tasks for both this and my personal laptop. 
* I never felt this thing struggle, but that's not surprising with a light workload and a 13th gen i7-P. 
* This isn't a gaming machine, but a quick test in Minecraft gave me roughly similar framerates as my M1 Pro's GPU (~100-130 FPS, default settings). Rocket League on default settings was hovering around 40 FPS. Lighter titles should be playable, especially if you're willing to lower framerates, but this isn't the machine for you if you want to do any real gaming.   
* I may be spoiled by my MBP, but the Book3 gets noticeably warmer and the fans kick on more frequently than my MBP. It's not to the point where it's interfering with anything, but it's something I noticed. During the few minutes I was testing framerates with Minecraft, the Book3 was blasting its fan from the moment the game loaded and the MBP didn't even have time to get warm. 
  * That being said, being able to just install anything without worrying about ARM compatibility is freeing. Windows has their translation layer, as does macOS, but I try to avoid relying on it because a) there's a (small) hit to performance and battery and b) I don't expect the translation layers to stick around forever. 

# Ecosystem - 8/10

* Overall, I like what Samsung's trying to do here. If I could move away from macOS I'd be taking a hard look at Samsung's ecosystem as a replacement. 
* They have alternatives for a lot of the major integrations Apple has between their devices:
  * Quick Share vs AirDrop
  * Secondscreen vs Sidecar
  * Multi Control vs Universal Control
  * Phone Link (yes, I know this isn't Samsung specific) vs Continuity
* Some of these solutions are actually more functional. Quick Share lets you share via QR code or link so you can share with non-Samsung devices. Multi Control lets you control your phone, not just your tablet. Phone Link isn't limited to Samsung devices since it's a Google/Microsoft partnership. 
* My main gripe is that a lot of these alternatives have a little more friction than Apple's solutions. For example, with Multi Control you have to open the app to connect to your other devices, where with Universal Control you just move your cursor over to the edge and it'll connect automatically as you cross over the edge.

# Other

* **PORTS**. As much as I want to be live in a USB-C world, we're just not there yet, so **thank you**, Samsung, for keeping one USB-A around. I do wish they'd placed the USB-C ports on both sides so you could choose which side you use for charging, but I was told that's a limitation with the daughterboards they use for the ports. 
* The fingerprint scanner isn't the best. It works, but it's hit and miss in my experience. 
* The webcam is nothing to write home about.",1676934890.0

Seeking Advice on Switching from iPhone to Samsung Due to iMessage Issues,6,117aufr,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/117aufr/seeking_advice_on_switching_from_iphone_to/,26,"Hello everyone,

I'm hoping to get some advice on a problem I've been struggling with for a while now. I've been a lifelong iPhone user and I'm heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, especially in iMessage. However, I'm also a professional photographer and I've found that Samsung's Galaxy takes far superior photos, particularly indoors. As a result, I've been carrying around two phones for years, which has become a major inconvenience.

Recently, I decided to make a switch to Samsung Galaxy S23U and commit to it permanently. However, I've been facing a significant issue with iMessage. When I've tried to switch my SIM card from iPhone to Samsung in the past, Apple removed my information from their iMessage database, but people who had my information stored in their phone were not able to receive my messages. This has caused me a lot of frustration and has even affected my work, as I need to communicate with clients and colleagues regularly.

As a professional, text messages are essential for my livelihood and I need to be sure that my messages are delivered without any issues. While I've tried using a ""hack app"" called Beeper to get all my iMessages onto my Samsung, it's not a reliable method and it hinders the full functionality of texting and communicating. I've also tried swapping SIM cards before, but Apple does some shady things that prevent messages from being delivered properly.

I really want to make a permanent switch to Samsung, but the iMessage issue is making it difficult for me. While WhatsApp is an option, not everyone uses it and it's impossible to get some people to change. I'm hoping someone can offer some helpful information, past experience, or a solution to this problem.

Thank you for your help!

Edit: I am aware of the ""de-register iMessage number"" from Apple's website. Ive used that several times in the past, and, although it de-registers \*my\* number from iMessage, \*other\* people's phones still do not, at times, receive my texts and their phones ""think"" that an iMessage should be coming through.",1676908364.0

They appear to be the only store selling it.

I've tried a few Magsafe cases so far including the Mous limitless 5.0 and the Pitaka, but the Zagg gear4 Denali Snap case feels the best to me.  It has all the qualities of a protective case without the bulk.  

The Pitaka case is very thin with almost zero shock absorption and limited protection on the sides and I was actually quite disappointed with the Mous case.  A lot of sharp edges and it didn't feel premium to me at all, but the magnet on both the Pitaka and Mous case are stronger than the Zagg.  Pitaka's magnet felt the strongest but I wouldn't say the magnet is necessarily weak on the Zagg, I would say it's pretty decent!  Works just fine on my magsafe car and desk chargers.

Just wanted to put this out there in case anyone was curious.  They also sell this in the Ultra variant on the Verizon store.

My usage is pretty normal. Mix of wifi and mobile data. Some social media/reddit browsing, music listening via bluetooth and watching some YouTube  videos. With this usage I got only 4 hr 40 min of SOT before the battery hit 10%.  I have setup couple of routine one of which is switching off all connections and putting the phone to power saving mode while I sleep (1am -8am). Even with these measures in place, I see battery drain after wake up to be 6%. Without this routine setup overnight battery drain was 10%.  In just 40min after disconnecting from the charger and with light usage - mobile data, couple of calls, wallet transactions, couple camera clicks battery discharged from 99% to 90%.

 I do not see my device capable of even 6 hrs SOT, pretty far from all the 7-10 SOT user claims. Wondering if my device is an outlier.

is it better to charge to 80% or 100%?,135,116wjww,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/116wjww/is_it_better_to_charge_to_80_or_100/,146,"I've heard a lot of people say that only charging to about 80-85% will make your battery last longer, because the most damage occurs when charging between 80-100%

But if you only charge to 80% every day, you will only have 80% max every day. Sure, in 2-3 years your battery health will be better than if you were charging to 100% every day, but in a worst case scenario your battery (when charging to 100% every day) degrades to about 80% in 2-3 years. 

The way I see it, I can have 80% battery everyday or have 100% everyday while it slowly degrades over 2-3 years until it gets to 80% health.  Meaning that every time you charge to 100% you will actually be getting only 80% of it's original capacity. Which is the same as only charging to 80% when the battery is at 100% health.

So unless you upgrade every 3+ years I don't see a reason to not charge to 100% all the time.",1676863795.0

Anyway. It's probably early but I'm already hearing great feedback about the S23, or rather how it should've been how the S22 is with the battery. That's good. 

I'm also open to considering the plus. The last plus I used was an S20+. I like the S23 size just like I like the S22 size but if the battery difference is quite huge I'm willing to jump. 

Also, just wondered, did they finally replace the Exynos chips for EU with snapdragon?

"Samsungs ""shutter lag"" and blurry photo problem explained and how they could fix it",152,116oacz,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/116oacz/samsungs_shutter_lag_and_blurry_photo_problem/,73,"Everybody knows about Samsungs ""shutter lag"" issue, which to many seems like a complicated issue when IMO it really isn't.

First part of the problem is the actual shutter lag, which is the time between pressing the button and the phone taking the picture. Samsung included a feature that lets you hold the shutter button to record a video, which means that the phone will only take photos once you release the shutter button. I always believed that not giving an option to turn this off was a stupid idea and thankfully you can already fix this with Camera Assistant. They should consider disabling this by default or asking users on first startup. 

The second and more interesting part is the actual shutter speed of the photos. It seems that Pixel phones automatically adjust the shutter speed based on the amount of motion in the viewfinder, which any Pixel owner can test very easily. This is why Pixels still do good in camera comparisons where phones are held still, but it handles motion much better than Samsung phones because Samsung phones will still use a slow shutter speed while Pixels speed it up to reduce motion blur.

So that's it. Samsung literally built stuff like Document scanning and Bixby vision, but not just some algorithm to detect motion and correct shutter speeds.

**TL;DR: Adjust shutter speed based on viewfinder motion, like on the Pixel.**

edit: I've done some more testing and shutter lag is still a bit lower on a Pixel while also preserving HDR (Samsung sometimes loses HDR), which makes sense given the lengths to which Google went to reduce shutter lag. Still, the slow shutter speeds causing blurry photos can be fixed with the method I described, which is exactly what Google does on Pixels as well.

They should be able to fix this if they know what they're doing. I have no idea why they haven't already, maybe the issue is more complicated than what I described but it doesn't seem that way to me.",1676841595.0

When I got my ipad last year, I was super keen on switching over to iphone 13/14 this year, but the S23 line dropped and wowwwww - now I kinda down for that.

With both priced around the same, I seek for your opinions on whether should I take the grand leap to apple/remain android.

Reasons I'm on the fence:
Not wanting to be stuck in the ecosystem and storage 
(similar price for 256gb Samsung S23 vs 128gb iphone 14).

Some say I should get a 128gb iphone and use my ipad as a second storage (I'm just using ipad to read/study hence the huge remaining storage). But the S23 camera/specs is overall better imo and with the pre-order deals, I can get an free upgrade on the storage as well.

Need help this poor girl (I meant it) who wishes to have every penny of her money worth it on the right phone.

I'm pretty much a heavy user all day, even through work. All of this was on a 5G sim card with the screen the entire time.

I started my shift at 98%. I didn't have power saving  mode on during the first two hours of scrolling Twitter, reddit and watching YouTube. It got down to about 89%. 9% drop in two hours of use isn't bad. I was on pace to be around 56%, give or take at the end of the shift.

Once I noticed that power saving mode wasn't on, I turned it on and it greatly improved the performance. By the time I finished my shift, used Lyft for a 30 minute ride home(my car is currently in the shop) and continued watching YouTube until I was home, my battery was left at 70%.

If I was even a medium user, this phone would definitely last me more than 1 day. I can't imagine what you'd get as a light user!

My old phone would get very hot under similar circumstances and I'd have to at least charge it twice while working. It was also very uncomfortable within my pocket because of the heat.

I've messed with all the permissions settings nope no help. So I'd hear them they wouldn't hear me and I couldn't turn it off. I'd literally have to turn off my head unit.

All results said click the button at the home screen or enable driving mode and then change modes to disconnect. Button doesn't exist in any settings and the latter doesn't work.

I am furious right now and feeling horrible. I just had the worst experience shopping from Samsung Shop App.

&#x200B;

I ordered the S23 on launch day with the free fast brick and wireless charger. It was an exchange for my S22.

The delivery guy arrives and rejects my phone after seeing minor signs of usage. Wear and tear on the camera flag. I argue that this is not a scratch, and Samsung says this is acceptable. Mind you, I have already taken the Phone to a Samsung Smart Cafe, and it was clear that the phone was good for a full exchange offer. He argues it is a scratch and he won't take the phone.

Over this mark  https://imgur.com/JGK3xBu  

This is what Samsung Says on their website. But clearly doesn't practice. "" Ensure that the mobile phone is in working condition with its display  intact, and that it is not damaged, broken, or otherwise tampered with.  **Normal wear and tear is acceptable**. Ensure that you share correct  details of the used product, so that the partner’s associate can  validate the same successfully at the time of pickup. ""

So I raise a ticket with the Customer Care and some guy who was handling it, without even going through the pictures or reading my email properly. Just cancelled the whole order. With all the discounts, and freebies. That Idiot even failed to address me by my correct name, just an example of what an ignorant idiot he is.

&#x200B;

Now, I am just furious and extremely saddened by this experience. Samsung has a horrible Customer Care Service, and I am considering other options now. I definitely don't want to keep this S22 anymore, that's for sure.

I wish there was someway I could get back to these companies for treating the customers like this and getting away with this horrible Customer Service.",1676769740.0

Wait, I did all that yesterday. WTF.

Tapped the notif, got a window that listed like a dozen shitty games I have less than zero interest in, and the top said ""installed games, installed by mobile services manager."" Had to play the ""find and uninstall"" game on the shit it smeared onto my phone.

And of course it's marked as a system app so I had to enable the display of system apps in the app manager to see it. Also of course because it's marked as a system file I can only force-stop it, so as soon as I find out what the actual name for the package is I'm gonna be launching ye olde ADB and disabling/uninstalling it.

Apparently ""Mobile Services Manager"" is a shitware/bloatware autoinstaller (also/formerly known as ""DT Ignite"") that comes standard with the Android 13 distribution on the S23s, and carriers can use it to push crap onto the phone *without any user interaction or asking for user permission*. It's also a problem child with a several-year history as far as I can tell, and is even listed as a trojan by a few anti-malware apps.

Gotta love it when thousand-dollar phones come with a built-in ad dropper/PUP installer...

&nbsp;

UPDATE: Mobile services manager *reinstalled the same shitware that it did previously and I took off*! Had to go back through and re-remove the garbage games it dropped a second time. This time I was pissed off and grabbed an APK list app and found its two com files: com.dti.att (since I'm on AT&T) and com.dti.folderlauncher. Fired up ADB for some debugging, and uninstalled both. If they come back I'm nuking the files outright.

While I was at it I also ripped out Bixby, the AR stuff I don't use, the gaming stuff I also don't use as I don't play games on this phone, and a couple other odds and ends I don't or won't use that I find annoying (like Samsung Pass - if I want to put a password manager on there it'll be KeePass).

Thinking about getting the S23 (base) after 9 years of using only Sony Xperia and Google Pixel.,2,115mnc9,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115mnc9/thinking_about_getting_the_s23_base_after_9_years/,21,"Hello,

Since I had my first smartphone back in AUG 2013, I have only had two brands: Sony Xperia and Google Pixel. 

I tried to stay faithful to Sony, but the price of their phones is too high for what they are offering (only two major updates and ironically the camera isn't the best).

I switched to Pixel back in FEB 2021. My experience has been positive. The Pixel 4a is a very good device for its price (I paid US$390 because I exported it to my country). However, the battery is horrible. I am about to go to my first international trip since the pandemic and I am worried the phone won't let me take pictures. I bought a fast powerbank for now.

I have never had a Samsung phone. However, I've been using Samsung tablets for about 7 years. It's important to mention the way I use my tablet is different. I use it mostly to watch my weekly tv shows, reading and for YouTube and some music sometimes. That's it. That's why I was never bothered by the bloatware even if my A7 Lite only came with 32GB.

I could make a sacrifice and get the S23 base, but these are my worries.

**Bloatware**: My tablet is insanely bloated by a lot of apps you can disable, but not uninstall.

**Camera**: the Pixel 4a takes amazing pictures 95% of the time. The reviews of the S23 are good, but are the pictures as good as the Pixel's?

**Battery Life**: I don't expect 10hr, but can I expect 8hr of SoT on Wi-Fi?

**Support**: how many major updates is Samsung offering? 

The experience of those who have had Pixels is welcome.

Thanks",1676747282.0

I want OFF dynamic island. I'm downright sick of the iPhone. Sick of iOS. So plain, so boring. Zero innovation for the last 5+ years from Apple. All we got is a boring, lame, lifeless Dynamic Island.

U23 Ultra just arrived yesterday. Will this be my ticket OFF the Island? Pretty sick upon first impressions -- love the innovation, S-pen cool, works great. Display is second to none.. Also plays nice with my windows based PC. 

Not saying I'm going to keep it, as I've been here before... I may return it, who knows. But I am enjoying my time off the Island. 

Biggest pet peeve seems to be the lack of the lock screen turning ON when new alerts come in, as they do on the iPhone. I tend to miss alerts when my screen doesn't light up. I know there is ""glimpse notifications"" 3rd party app that I can download to utilize, but I really don't want to use a third party app to simply get notifications. Has Samsung created a solution for this apparent massive oversight yet? 

Ive also fired up my old Watch3, which seems to be working great in lieu of my Apple Watch Ultra. Trying to work out the kinks with Samsung Health and get used to how its interface works, as well. Working on transporting apps over, too (MyNetDiary, pacer, etc).

S23 Ultra not charging over night,1,115ikhd,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115ikhd/s23_ultra_not_charging_over_night/,12,"I got the new S23 Ultra and like it so far. The issue I am having is that it won't charge over night.

I bought a Onn wireless charger which I used to set the phone on at night to charge. When I put the phone on it the first night it was at 70%, when I got up the next morning it was at 63%. I chalked it up to me not having the charger in the right place on the phone or I had bumped it at night moving it to a spot where it didn't charge. Same thing happened the next night. At this point I'm starting to think it's just a cheap shitty charger. Last night I plugged in the phone instead of using wireless charging, when I got up the phone still wasn't fully charged and was at a lower % then when I plugged it in. Every time I set it on the charger or plug it in before bed the phone does indicate that it is charging. 

This is only happening overnight. I have the phone sitting next to me right now on the same charger and it is charging just fine. I can sit here and watch the battery % go up as I am typing this.

Disappointing battery life of S21 ultra,0,115d73f,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115d73f/disappointing_battery_life_of_s21_ultra/,3,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to share some frustration with the battery life of my S21 ultra.

In March it's going to be two years since I bought the phone and I can't be more happy with it except one thing - battery life. It's HORRIBLE. 

I'm the kind of a person who really takes care of their phone because I plan to use it for at least 3 or 4 years. Because of that, I never charged my phone to 100%, only to 85%, made sure I don't discharge it too much (never below 30% really), never charged it overnight, you get the point. I'd say I'm a moderate user, where I'll use it for general texting and sometimes watching Twitch or Youtube for hour or two. 

All that gives me a battery life that's less than a day.  I previously owned Note 10 and the battery life there was way better than on the S21 Ultra. Because of that I decided to download battery app from store, charged my phone from 1% to 100% and got the great news ... Out of advertised 5000 mAh battery, I have left around 4200 mAh. 

4200 mAh is around 85% of the original capacity after two years of very careful use. To be fair I am really disappointed in the battery life of the phone, I expected it to easily last me a day but that's just not been possible for around a year now. 

I understand that the battery will obviously degrade over the years, but 15% degrade in two years with very careful handling of the phone just seems way to off for me. For comparison, my even older phone S7 still has battery life of 90%, after it's been used for 2 years by me and 1 year by my mom. Same goes for the Note 10 I gave her she's still using right, that phone is at 88% after being used 2 years by me and 2 years by her already. 

Does anyone else have similar experience with their phones? This is really frustrating me, and given how insane battery life iPhones have  at the moment it's really making me think about everything as someone who owned Samsung phones their whole life.",1676719229.0

S23+ battery life and other comments,27,115cblq,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115cblq/s23_battery_life_and_other_comments/,38,"Coming from an Exynos S10+, I am quite happy with the battery life and performance on the S23+ after about a week of using it. I started my day yesterday morning (8 am) with 100% and got about 8 hrs 45 mins of active Screen On Time (SOT) till today noon (15%) with heavy-ish usage. Screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/kwnH8yZ). I shuffle through, Spotify, Boost, YouTube, WhatsApp and news websites on Chrome mainly. I switch between WiFi and 5G but I think it's safe to say that it's about 70% WiFi. The display was set to 120 Hz and adaptive brightness was turned on. I also use my Galaxy Buds Plus to listen to music sparsely throughout the day. 

I am writing this post for people who are on the fence about upgrading from an Exynos S9/S10 to the S23+/S23U. I had a tough time deciding between the S23U and the S23+ as I really like the 10x optical zoom on the S23U but strongly dislike its shape and size. Also, I don't see myself using the S-Pen a lot. On the other hand, I really like the shape and design of the S23+ but was skeptical about the screen. I then realized that I had my S10+ on FHD+ and not WQHD+ throughout the last 3½ years. So, I finally went with the S23+ 512 GB and I must say, I am very happy with my decision. The switch from Exynos to Snapdragon is noticeable in terms of performance, battery and heat management as well. I don't have any problems with the screen at all (I did configure the screen zoom and font size to make it look the best) and I am very happy with the camera as well.

i can't believe the color transition ( banding ) is still so bad on top of line S23 Ultra,0,115bo1g,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115bo1g/i_cant_believe_the_color_transition_banding_is/,20,"So Samsung has the known best OLED panel on the market for its S23U. I don't doubt. But whats wrong with Google and Samsung's own firmware and software support that makes the color banding still so bad on year 2023, not even good enough for a true 8 bit system, and so far benind any 8bit+FRC or even 10 bit system.

Dont lie to yourself it's unnoticeable. Look at the samsung default green-brown wallpapaer , upper left half,. See how tbr shades break with many boudaries going from dark to bright? There are a lot more scenes and GUI interfaces affected too.

And i am gonna prove it's even slightly worse than the samsung model 3 years ago. A random old iphone will beat the sxxx out of s23U. Everything shown here is less obvious than how it really looks i swear.

This one appears to be smooth on both S23U and iphone 12. But look at the incorrect transitions at arrows
. The 2 stripes are obviously darker than surroundings. It should become brighter all the way.  the iPhone has it done properly without any visual weiredness.

And then the famous Rtings gradient image. This is a 16 bit tiff. On iphone if opened in photos, it would be shown in 10 bit. And if opened in Safari it's 8 bit. Yes, iphone supports 10 bit with iOS 16. Dont be fooled. And i dont think any app supports 10 bit on S23U. 
https://i.imgur.com/xoGz1G4.jpeg

Look at the arrows where Note20U and S23 U show large jump in red and green. Interestingly it seems they appeared exactly at the same levels! So Samsung uses the identical LUT and color transform matrix between native and a standard color space for the panels 3 generations apart??

Again the contrast and artifacts are much more noticeable in reality. Steps in iphone at all and the transition is uniform and consistent. ( the weired pattern is from reflection) The Samsung models, due to only 8 bit depth, show edges wheenever a level changes , which is totally OK. What's bad is the sudden jumps in shades here and there. 

And s23U is even worse than note20 in some scenes because of the poorly calibrated gamma/LUT. 

This is the login screen of Southwest app. Look at the bigger jump of shade at the arrow for S23U.
https://imgur.com/a/Gfrb71h
 The  number of levels is the same for 2 models that i can confirm so there is no additional bit depth loss in S23. Its just that it's calibrated poorly.

So this is disappointing. I am not nitpicking such trivials and ruining people's good feelings about their adorable phone.  Its just sometimes these are so annoying to see and they ruin the scene by cutting an otherwise enjoyable screen with these ugly banding edges.

Best < 15/20 $ screen protector for impact protection AND working fingerprint reader on a Galaxy S22 ?,1,115b0vg,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115b0vg/best_1520_screen_protector_for_impact_protection/,17,"Hi !

I'm currently looking for a screen protector for my brand new S22, but it seems like most screen protectors have issues with the fingerprint reader, or are hit-or-miss.

I already have a folio case (to protect the screen when it is closed), but as I tend to have clumsy hands (at least in the past), I would like one that has a rather good impact protection and a good value for money. 

My brother is quite happy with his JETech screen protector, but reviews for the S22 shows it doesn't work most of the time with the screen protector. Around 25 $ there also is the Rhinoshield Impact Protection, which is very tough, but reviews are pretty bad, so it doesn't seems like it is as good as it used to be for that price.

There also is amFilms screen protectors (Hybrid or OneTouch, not the +30 $ one), but I would like more reciews on the impact protection side aswell as on potential issues with the fp reader.

I also saw the Milomdoi screen protector, and also the Supershieldz tempered glass which seems good, I guess ? What do you think ?

I read a lot of posts on various subreddits, but people are basically looking for a scratch-resistant protector. Most people seems to buy expensive WSD and amFilms tempered glass or Samsung's official screen protector, while a majority of them agrees that expensive screen protectors are in practice almost the same as cheaper ones.

I think I know where “Bixby” got its name from. 🖖🏼,240,1153aev,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1153aev/i_think_i_know_where_bixby_got_its_name_from/,35,"As far as I know, there’s no official explanation given nor sufficient information found online, as to where SAMSUNG’s voice assistant Bixby gets its name from. There are some suggestions that it’s chosen because it’s a unique name and does not bring any trademark issues, so it was safe to be named as Bixby. So, according to my research, it was almost fully unknown. Well, until now… It might not be the actual case, but I’m convinced it’s the closest guess to the origin of the name Bixby. 

In Star Trek The Original Series, there’s an episode named “Mirror, Mirror” which is the fourth episode from the second season. The episode was first broadcast on October 6, 1967 and it was ranked as one of top ten ""must see"" episodes of the original series, and one of the most celebrated ones. 

In the episode, we see the crew communicating with the ship’s computer and the computer answering questions and computing the commands given by the crew like a modern day voice assistant, like Bixby, Siri, Alexa. 
It wasn’t of course the first time computer appearing in the series so far, but I believe it was indeed the first episode in which the communication between the voice assistant and the crew was this much advanced. 

“Mirror, Mirror” episode was written by Jerome Bixby, a writer highly acclaimed by the critics, and this was the first of the four episodes he wrote for the series. 

And, as a matter of fact, the developers or the company was inspired by this computers advancement which was created by Jerome Bixby, and SAMSUNG is paying tribute to him and his legacy. 

I’m ready to be proven wrong! Go ahead. 🖖🏼",1676683332.0

I got my s23 on the 15th and everything is great aside from the finicky fingerprint scanner and the recognition of usb external devices. Its so inconsistent with external usb that it’s ridiculous. I have a nvme ssd in a usb 3.2 gen 2 10gbps enclosure and i formatted it in FAT32/exfat/ntfs and it still randomly works on the s23. (the next day it doesn’t show up at all anymore). Initially It will work and I can transfer 10+ large video files then the next time I plug in it it doesn’t see it. It will then randomly work and not work. I read it was a power issue with nvme so I grab a low power SATA ssd and a usb 3.1 gen 1 5gbps enclosure and it works and I can transfer files fine at first. I then try another file (100mb) and then it freezes and disconnects and now won’t show up on the phone anymore. Is anyone else having this issue with their s23? Is this being addressed at all?

is it worth upgrading from S22U (exynos version) to S23U just for the new Snapdragon chip?,13,114zs4o,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/114zs4o/is_it_worth_upgrading_from_s22u_exynos_version_to/,105,"So I upgraded from the S20 5G to the S22 Ultra when it came out last year.
I like the phone, I think it's a great phone (though I still struggle to use the camera - I find the camera interface not very intuitive at all, and think the iPhone cameras are better in that regard. I was a bit disappointed by the S22U and even the S20 cameras, only becuase I find them non intuitive. If I sat down and properly looked into it, I'm sure I'd find them much better).

BUT I'm in the UK, and I know my phone has an Exynos chip and I think that may be the source of my problems. 

- Not being able to use the camera after viewing an image taken, unless I close (quit) and reopen the camera app, which is very annoying for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it type scenario 
- phone keyboard sometimes freezing and playing catch up (sometimes if I try delete a few characters it'll glitch then catch up and delete whole words amd sentences) 
- phone being frozen on (only a handful of times, and somehow I've been able to resolve it each time) and having a notification pop up saying UI is not responding. 

It doesn't happen all the time, and it's not a low storage issue as its a 512GB with 318GB used.

I'm debating whether to trade in my S22U and upgrade to the S23U but I'm not sure if it's too much just for the new chip? 
The new camera is a bonus, but again I've said I struggle a bit with them and find I can't use them to their full potential.

If I trade in online, and apply the code S23BOOST I can get up to £750 off (anyone who doesn't have a smartphone to trade in/doesn't want to,  the code S23SAVE gives £100 off instantly) and get it for I think £629, though it won't ship til the 3rd March. 

I've also not done an online trade in, and would worry Royal Mail strikes would mean my phone gets lost and I don't get the upgrade discount; I'd rather do it in store. 
Anyone know if Samsung Stores honour online voucher codes? 

Anyway, what are your thoughts on this?",1676673526.0

The aluminum chassis is attractive, and its compact size makes it easy to carry around. I had to adjust to the larger touchpad as my previous laptop had a smaller one, but it didn't take long to get used to it. Although I wish the keyboard had more depth, it's still comfortable to type on. ~~The laptop lacks a fingerprint reader~~ and only has one USB type-A port, but it compensates for that with two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and an HDMI port. The battery life is great, and I was able to use it all day without needing to charge it.

&#x200B;

The laptop's performance is impressive, and I was able to run multiple tabs, documents, and presentations without any issues. Although I haven't tried gaming on it, it runs lightweight games smoothly. The webcam quality is disappointing, and I hope that laptop manufacturers will start including better cameras as video calls are becoming increasingly common. The laptop has not overheated, except for one instance when I accidentally left it running in my laptop bag. The screen quality is fantastic, with accurate colors and the 3:2 aspect ratio makes it immersive for work or entertainment. The Dolby Atmos sound also enhances the streaming and movie-watching experience. Overall, I think this laptop is a great choice for students, teachers, or anyone looking for a reliable, lightweight, and premium-quality laptop for a good price.

Other Notes:

&#x200B;

\* Battery Life: 10-12 hours casual use, medium brightness

\* Charge time: Little over an hour depending if I am using it or not

\* Touchscreen: Responsive and accurate

\* Pen: Inconvenient as there is no place to dock it, you have to stick it to the back of the screen.

\* Gaming: Not a gaming laptop, emulators run smooth, Sims 4 is smooth as well

\* Not a dust magnet

\* Easy to pair with the phone but I have not found a real reason to control my phone with the laptop (just seems like a gimmick) other than to send over photos",1676662752.0

1% to 73% 30min 45W charge (it says Supercharge 2.0 when plugged) (phone is turned on+Wifi)

1% to 57% 30min 25w Charge (It says Super charge only when plugged) (Phone is on+Wifi)

Sure its only 16% Difference (Beats the 1% with S22U) but mentally leaving the house with 70%+ battery is different than 50%+ :P when you are in a rush

Samsung is cheap though for not including it for free.

Edit : The full time to charge using 45w is 58min to me (from 1% to 100% while phone is on)

I usually end up with a dbrand skin and a clear case eventually, so I don't typically worry much about getting anything but black... but I'm excited by a new color!

EDIT: I know graphite won by a landslide, but as I was packaging up the red to return it, I felt really disappointed. Thus, I kept the red! The heart knows what it wants. *shrug*

I went S10 > iPhone 13 Pro > S23+,33,114ldde,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/114ldde/i_went_s10_iphone_13_pro_s23/,14,"Had always been an Android user since the Galaxy S2. Then had the S4, Note 4, Moto XT1575, OG Pixel, S10.

I really went to an iPhone 13 Pro as I wanted a normal sized phone (around 6"") with 512gb storage. In the US you're basically limited to Apple, Samsung and Google. I had first tried the Pixel 7 Pro and S22 Ultra.

The Pixel 7 Pro had a few odd scrolling related bugs that really annoyed me. I would have otherwise maybe kept it even if it was a bit too big for my liking. The S22U was really too big and the sharp corners were very uncomfortable to hold.

So I got an iPhone and used it for 3 months. There is honestly a lot to like about it. The phone is generally smooth and most of the apps are well designed. But then slowly the annoyances started to build:

* No universal back gesture. Most of the time the back gesture worked, but sometimes it didn't and that was annoying
* Animations are great on iPhone but you also always need to wait for them to finish before you can interact with the screen
* Managing photos and files is impossible if you want to do it any other way than Apple intended
* Keyboards all suck. My text input was generally a lot slower
* Notifications are messy overall, though I do like the badges on the app icons (on Android when you dismiss a notification the badge also disappears which is dumb)
* My biggest annoyance was needing to use iTunes to put anything on the phone, like music and old photos. Such an antiquated way of doing things. You first need to create a whole Playlist library to mimic your folder structure and then import it all to your phone and then each time you want to add anything you need to sync the Library instead of just copying the file like on Android. And then for some reason each time it would resync 3500 songs! Pissed me off to no end.
* The Apple app store is a capitalist hellscape. Almost everything wants to nickel and dime you, charge a subscription here, charge a subscription there. I don't mind supporting the developer of a good app, but a lot of apps you only need to use every now and again so no, I'm not paying you $5 a month for your shitty app. 

So now I got the S23+. There was a lot to like about the iPhone, don't get me wrong. But it's good to be back to a device that just gives me more freedom to do what I want. Android you can use out of the box and be perfectly content, or you can tweak it. And that's just why I prefer Android. It's better for me.

And the S23+ is a great device. Right on the edge of what I can handle size wise (any bigger is a no go). Though I would've preferred the regular S23 still, but no 512 gb storage on that in the US.",1676643341.0

Have any of you compared the positioning accuracy of the Galaxy S23 Ultra yet? Since I live in Europe, my earlier S22 Ultra has an Exynos processor and I can relate to it. Before the release of the S23U, I read that Qualcomm had already introduced GNSS RTX Trimble in the Snapdragon 8 Gen1, which they boasted would offer meter-level accuracy. As soon as I set up my new phone I started testing and comparing everything one by one. Unfortunately, it turned out that the S23U has worse accuracy than the S22U. Looking at the estimated horizontal and vertical accuracy, the S23U achieves 3.8/2.5 meters, while the S22U on Exynos achieves 1.5/2.0 meters at the same time holding the phones side by side. I'm using the GSPTest app [GPSTest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.gpstest) Those are screenshoots from my tests:

Now I have the S23 Ultra and I can't fault it. Amazing cameras, amazing battery life, great speakers, my phone performance is amazing. Samsung have perfected and improved the S22 Ultra.

1st day with s23+ truly a beast!,10,11438zm,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11438zm/1st_day_with_s23_truly_a_beast/,11,"So I was able to test my s23+ for a full long day outside for the first time.

I started at 100% at 8am and came back home at 11pm only on 5g.

Although i did only use screen for 1h37min i was still at 68% when I arrived home.

Truly impressive knowing that I was 3h in an area without good network coverage which probably was heavy on the battery.

In perspective, the similar day with my 4 years old s9+ i would come home with 15/20% battery if I'm optimistic.

With this in mind I know I can safely use the 85% charging limit option that samsung offer to avoid reducing lifespan of the battery by remaining too much in the 85/100 range.

I feel that this phone could last easily 3 days if used in economic mode with network partially activated for a long weekend in the wild for example.

Anyway looking forward to test it more!",1676586933.0

Samsung QN700B 8k seems seriously flawed and even rtings is vastly downplaying the issue.,0,113zz8j,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113zz8j/samsung_qn700b_8k_seems_seriously_flawed_and_even/,18,"**A while ago I started heavily looking into 8k TV for PC productivity powerhouse setup.**

I currently use a 40"" 4k monitor, and saw 55"" 8k as a huge upgrade. But first my task was to go to local Currys to see the display in person, and my first impression was rather poor. 8k screen looked significantly worse than nearby 4k screen of same 55"" size. **This also applies to 65"" QN800B**


I noticed that the mild dithering in shadows mentioned by Rtings is actually significantly worse, and even over 2ft away this was very visible in form of jagged high contrast edges, which appeared sharp and straight on a 4k TV next to it.

I also had a chat with the rep, who quickly admitted that 8k TVs are a serious gimmick and even the rep recommended staying away.

Unfortunately they didn't allow me to test a laptop input into the TV to see if that changes anything about the pixel dithering issue. 

I played with the remote and tried switching the picture modes (game mode or pc mode was absent), and the dithering only became worse when I took off the 'in the shop' mode.

So I started investigating and learned about the Contrast modulation, and how it affects picture quality. Samsung's 8k TVs have very low contrast modulation compared to many 4k TVs they also make. It is related to how Samsung uses neighboring pixels to improve contrast in sharp edges, thus creating the dithering effect.

The next thing I realized, that all of this issue is heavily downplayed, not really mentioned or discussed at all.

People buy 8k TVs fairly blindly due to absence of serious warnings even from RTINGS. One fellow /r/monitors user has been very frustrated with his QN700B and it's dithering issue. As I see no solution, i've recommended him to try refunding it, or replacing for different (4k) model.

------
**TLDR:**

So the real reason why I posted this is... I want 8k TV owners to come out and discuss their issues and possible solutions. 

Let me know if plugging HDMI 2.1 PC into this TV actually affects dithering or is it really a no go, as I still wish to have a 8k 55"" screen for graphical work.

And spread the word so people don't end up with an expensive unwanted TV.

This LTPO tech is really poorly understood in general. Some reports  indicate that the S22 can drop down to 24Hz, while Samsung themselves  state that it can't go below 48Hz.

S23 Ultra + Whitestone Dome Tempered Glass Review,7,113vnlh,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113vnlh/s23_ultra_whitestone_dome_tempered_glass_review/,22,"So I have heard the grumblings about Whitestone and such on here, and I know that there's case compatibility issues.  Just going to share my experience so far.

I got my S23 Ultra yesterday and pretty much the first thing I did was to install the screen protector.  The installation has quite a few steps, but their video is pretty good.  Just be careful, go slow, and you should be fine.  I have a few tips for the install:

1 - Put a piece of paper or something under the jig to catch drips of adhesive.  It doesn't all stay contained under the screen protector and the absorption pads well...they mostly work but not all the way.

2 - After the adhesive is fully spread out under your protector, it is still pretty easy to move if you lightly press it.  This allows you to align it perfectly before curing.  HOWEVER, if your surface is not level it can still move during curing.  Also, the rubber block they have you place over the lower end can cause it to move slightly.  So I recommend after removing the block but before starting the curing process, realign the top-to-bottom position if you need and make sure it's level.

3 - The speaker cover sticker is a bit of a pain since the sticker portion is so thin.  You might use a toothpick to help stick it down over the speaker.  Though with that said, it didn't look like any adhesive went anywhere near the speaker, but better safe than sorry.

4 - If you're going to use a case, install the phone in your case first and then place the screen protector on the phone to see how it fits before removing the back sticker on the protector.  This will let you see if there are any problems.

I had heard of problems with the Unicorn Beetle cases and it's true still with the S23 Ultra and Whitestone combo.  There is not quite enough room in the corners for the protector to fit, but again the case doesn't extend enough to completely cover and ""hold down"" the edges of the protector.  I would bet that if I had put my phone into the UB Pro case it would have caused the protector to start pulling away from the phone.

I am using a Poetic Spartan case and it fits perfectly!  It doesn't touch the protector and so far there are no signs of any problems.  Also the Poetic Revolution looks like it should work.  So check your case fit first, it either needs to not touch or have enough overlap to be putting downward pressure evenly across the protector, though I suppose that could also cause issues.  Best bet is not touching at all IMO.

Installation went well with no issues, so you should be fine taking into account the tips above.  Go slow, watch the video a few times to make sure you're comfortable with all the steps.

Fingerprint!  It works just fine and it's fast.  No problems at all for me so far.

It looks great, can't really tell that it's on the screen.  There are a few dots around the edge of the protector that you will see when it's not installed.  I don't notice them at all.  Not sure what they are for, but you can't see them after installation.

It does get fingerprints, but I'm not sure it's any better/worse than the regular phone glass.  So far I'm quite happy with it.  No, I'm not going to be doing any intentional drop tests lol.

I also got the Whitestone camera lens protector kit, which was super easy to install and works great as well.

No, I have no affiliation with Whitestone, Poetic or Supcase.  I just wanted to get some details out for anyone else who might be interested in what options are available.  I do also like amFilm protectors, I had one on my old phone (S20+), but the Unicorn Beetle interfered with it and I ended up just using a film on it instead of the tempered glass, but have been running the phone with no protector for about a year now and it's been fine also.

Side note, the S20+ w/ Unicorn Beetle Pro case is not really that much smaller than the S23U with the Poetic Spartan.",1676567618.0

Like many here I used to do the pre-order every year and trade in my previous device but Samsung nerfed the trade-in values, accessory credits, heck even the $25 total discount from last year for doing the 4-payment system.
So anyways, I was clicking around on eBay to see what people were selling their used S22U's for and it's a mixed bag.

Then I went ""alright fine, I'll do it"" but then everything I could use ""accessory-wise"" is sold out. We have GW4's so we don't need new watches but even most of the GW5/Pro variations are sold out. The Rugged Gadget Case is sold out, the (new) 45W chargers are sold out, the 10,000mAh 25W PD battery packs are sold out... I can't think of anything else to get to use up the accessory credit

I really wanted to wait to see what the next sales will be but the kicker is the free storage upgrade that's currently available. Every other year it wouldn't have mattered but Samsung this year lowered the base RAM of the S22U to 8GB and I normally use more than 8 with regular use. So for this version I would need the 512 version (which I hate by the way cuz I usually hover around 100GB usage for like the last 6 years...).

The S23 Ultra + SD8G2 is a perfect combination!,13,113pgxy,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113pgxy/the_s23_ultra_sd8g2_is_a_perfect_combination/,20,"So I'm on the journey to test max screen on time on the s23u. I can firmly say this SD8G2 is very efficient. With the help of GalaxyMaxHz app, I can enable battery saving mode, light profile, extra dim, adaptive refresh from 10-120hz, and is a big difference in what the screen is consuming. I'm looking to get 9-10h screen on time with medium-mixed usage. All this having Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data, Location, and NFC turned on. Considering the chip is only running at probably a max of 65% capacity with tweaks, there is no lagging, maybe slightly when unlocking with fingerprint reader, but is very responsive.",1676550504.0

Resolution S23+,11,113ns80,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113ns80/resolution_s23/,19,"Hi everyone!  


Thinking of buying an S23+ as i'm finally able to buy the Snapdragon version but i'm a little worried about the FHD+ display. If i'm correct it's only around 393 ppi so i do wonder if you notice the difference? My Iphone 13 even has more ppi, around 460 and i like how crisp and sharp it looks.  
I can buy the 512gb version for €929.  
Another option would be to buy the Ultra but i fear it's too big for me (coming from an Iphone 13 and have small hands) and don't like curved displays. The Ultra acutally would be cheaper because i also wanted to buy the watch 5 and since that's included with the ultra i would save €21 (€1099 for the ultra and the watch 5 costs €191)

Second full day of use coming from my iphone,17,113lawb,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113lawb/second_full_day_of_use_coming_from_my_iphone/,17,"As mentioned, this is the second full day of use. 

Thoughts: 

Performance:
The phone has been more than snappy and I have yet to see any lag, glitches, etc. Coming from an iPhone 12 pro max, which has been remarkably powerful even to date, it has been more than powerful enough for *my* use 

Software:
I'm somewhat new to android, so keep my bias in mind. The android software has been more than snappy, so not really an issue with that. But coming from iOS, which I've enjoyed a lot, it's been different. Obviously. I did enjoy how iOS was simple and seemingly easier to navigate. But that's my opinion as someone only two days into a new OS. It's different but not bad at all

Battery: 
This is pretty high on my priorities. While I'm not a power user, my phone is always doing something. I work in the automotive industry in quality and I am constantly using my phone to take photos, record measurements, use as a calculator, and more. And when I'm home I listen to a lot, watch some videos, browse around, etc. I consider myself the average user plus a little more. For the last few days of use, my use has been average plus probably an extra 30 minutes of screwing around. Checking on my old phone, the last few day's screen on time has matched my rolling average on my phone. I've linked a Google drive folder at the bottom of the post for a Screenshot. As of right now I have 5:01 screen on, 6:40 screen off and am at 41%. The phone says 11:42 used, with 7:18 left. I'm more than happy! I do also have the 45w anker charger and it was a full charge in just slightly over an hour. So the average power user should be more than fine. Obviously, my continued use will show if this is true. 

Camera:
I use my camera a lot. I take a lot of photos for work, of trips, my jeep, and more,  and I have the 38,000 photos to prove it.  So a decent camera is another high priority. For quick photos, it seems to be perfect. Snap a picture and there it is! Has done well in low light, shutter lag has been reasonable, and just generally happy. The pro raw mode has been a treat! I like how I have total control of ISO, shutter speed, focus, and more. The focus is pretty cool how it'll highlight the in-focused areas a neon green. I like making videos in my free time and having this focus control makes even my proper DSLR feel a bit out of date. Not to say this will replace the considerably larger sensor, better zoom, and dedicated controls of it. But it will absolutely make me reach for the phone in my back pocket over the DSLR in my bag more often. Tonight I put my phone on my portable stand, pointed it at the sky, adjusted the focus, set iso to 100, shutter speed to 30s, and took a pic of the night sky! This was a 50mp photo and unedited, also part of the link below. I was very impressed with the long exposure. There was considerable light pollution in my area, so keep that in mind. But in this singular use case, I firmly believe I couldn't have taken a better photo on my proper DSLR. I'm going camping next weekend and look forward to testing then. I love the camera. Not too much of a fan with the pro raw being a separate app. I wish it was baked into the camera app. But eh, whatever. 

Do I regret swapping from my iPhone 12 pro max to the s23 ultra? Not as of right now! It's a snappy phone, has proven to have a good battery, camera is great, and proving to be a solid phone. There's a few nuances that are different coming from my iPhone, but I'll adjust just fine.

The link is in a comment, couldn't add it here. Keep in mind that there is some photo compression here. It looks more clear on the device",1676534190.0

In the case of loss, do you return the original device if it is later recovered and would they cover that shipping cost? And what happens to that device, can they remotely lock it as a stolen device so even if ""lost"" someone finding it can't get into my old device? Or would it still function?

I could also get the S23+ for 930€ but this doesn't seem to make sense in my opinion.

So I am debating between the base model and the Ultra.
I am in love with the small form factor of the S23 but the extra 335 for the better camera, display, battery, storage and resale value seem like a no-brainer.

I think even if I decide to sell the Ultra after 1 month bc it turned out to be too big for me, I could make money out of this deal. Am I wrong?

zfold 3 to S23U after one week and I am glad I made the switch and whoever thinks that S23U is a boring phone think again.,4,113fmnv,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113fmnv/zfold_3_to_s23u_after_one_week_and_i_am_glad_i/,4,"I had the zfold 3 since launch and I loved the Fold concept and looks since I took it out of the box. I enjoyed so much the ability to read books, browse the web, games and multitask. I initially used the Fold spend a lot but since I couldn't figure out a way to keep it with me it went into the drawer and just forgot about it.

After using the zfold3 for a while I started to discover the negatives of owning a Fold device 

1. Typing experience, regardless of which screen the typing experience was always painful. Tried different keyboards and ended up just using voice to dictate. 


2. Battery life is horrible on average I used to get 4.5 SOT. Yes I can disable stuff to get a longer battery life but what's the point of having an expensive dive while I don't use all of its capabilities

3. I casually go on bike rides and I like to use my phone as navigation unfortunately with the zfold 3 it's impossible to mount a heavy device and with any bumps, the device will fall. So throughout my time with zfold 3 I couldn't take it on a bike ride. Adding to this when going just jogging it not possible to keep the heavy device in your pocket cause it will keep bouncing around. 


4. I started a YouTube channel and using the zfold 3 for taking videos actually exceeded my expectations however I couldn't figure out any gimbal tha5 can support this device 

5. Apps are not optimized especially YouTube when switching between screens and the performance of the device was just not there at times lags sometimes 

Long story short zfold devices are a very productive devices however as you can see from above mentioned points it's not practical device. Finally I started to notice that a lot of people on zfold forums complain that the inner screen get the death line or the split line whatever you want to call it.

Therefore I placed my order the day S23U was announced. I initially thought OK I am back to normal phone and this is going to be boring. But after using the phone for almost a week this is by the most complete package phone I've ever used. 

1. Performance check
2. Battery life check 
3. Lighter weight compared to zfold 3 sure it a larger huge device but I started to get used to it
4. Typing experience check 
5. Camer quadruple check. Wow on the performance of these cameras. 
6. Spen built-in check 

The list can keep going but in all fairness the most annoying thing about the S23 U compared to zfold 3 is the fingerprint scanner I prefer so much the one on the zfold 3 since it's a hardware button it worked 99% of the time. S23U is good but not as good as the zfold 3 and I hope Samsung can just use hardware fingerprint scanners on the power button instead of under the display. 

The Fold technology for me is still in R&D phase and requires lots of areas to improve while the S line has reached to level where you are going to get a consistent experience mature with no surprises and this is what I am experiencing with the S23U mature and a complete package.",1676514482.0

S23 is LOVE,12,113cn8o,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113cn8o/s23_is_love/,27,"Been using my S23 for the past 2 days and I simply love it.

Coming from a European S22 (Exynos) IT IS THE REMEDY.

Besides that EU relief, it's an amazing phone.

Batterylife is stellar, I got roughly 6 hours of onscreen time out of it because I am on holiday excited to try my new phone and have time, compared to my measly 4 hours at mildly light usage (if at all most of the time) from the S22, given the highly light usage, it would double.

The S22 I've owned only for a month and managed to sell it without loss when the S23 launched (got it second hand new), originally coming from an S9+ which I broke myself through a work related accident (there was no need to upgrade, the S9+ was amazing), I'm so glad about the changes Samsung made besides the european Exynos problems. 

It's a huge step up even from the last chip and AI with essentially the same camera still does make a Great difference. 

I mean, the GPU outperforms the iPhone 14 Pro Max which has a dedicated silicon and is (depending whether it's the regular iPhone 14 or Pro / Max) matching it's CPU performance / outperforming it in single core (1975 points I've had). It's so good to the point hat it almost has the same performance as an Intel 8700k (whoever knows what that means), a still, very capable and powerful Desktop CPU.

But yeah the battery life man, I have no words, same feeling, even better when I had my 9+ for the first time.

I think, given the underwhelming YouTubers' reception of it as a mild update is just wrong.

They took what was great about the previous phone and perfected it. This phone will last you and will make you very happy both causal- and productivly.

I don't understand why it's been socially, on the internet, received so poorly, it's simply amazing, a powerhouse with refined features, great battery life and an outblasting performance. It basically is better than the current iPhone being an Android device.

It just goes to show how weird and affiliated today's ""influencers"" are, or possibly spoiled and don't get a clear picture of what's happening anymore.

If Apple had been on a low for a while and managed to get on the same silicon level with better camera quality, it would flood your YouTube search without even relevant context in between.

Amazing to know and sad to see.

The official Samsung silicone cases for the S23 line are really nice.,22,1138xm8,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1138xm8/the_official_samsung_silicone_cases_for_the_s23/,15,"I picked up the Samsung silicone grip case yesterday for my new S23 Ultra, and it's great. I was worried about it feeling sticky, having problems putting it in my pocket, or having it get covered with dust, dead skin, etc. based on what I'd read about other silicone cases (including past Samsung silicone cases), but I'm not having any of these problems.

The texture feels perfect. It feels soft compared to a TPU case, and it has enough grip to make the phone feel stable in my hand (even without using the strap). It doesn't make the phone feel bulky. (I actually feel like most modern phones are too thin, so the little bit of extra thickness feels good, but it doesn't add too much to the width of the phone.)

The strap is very sturdy. It easily keeps the phone attached to my hand even if I'm not holding it, but it doesn't get in the way when I'm holding the phone normally.

Unless the material dramatically changes with wear, I don't anticipate it picking up dust or debris. I have the dark gray/black version, so it would be noticeable.

Anyway, I hadn't found many reviews on this case, so I just thought I'd make a quick post for anyone who had similar concerns to mine. I can only compare this to a couple of other cases (the last being a Spigen), but I'm quite pleased so far.",1676496194.0

I change phones every 6 months. No phone has ever made me want to keep it for more than that time.  But the truth is, anyone shelling out the money to buy a Flagship galaxy device is going to have a decent experience overall.  These are samsung's best phones and righfully so, they aren't cheap.   They can easily last you 3 to 4 years (even longer) if you're a responsible person that knows how to take care of things (using a decent case, screen protector, never drop it etc).

S23 ultra compared to the s 22 ultra

Refined and improved in every way.  Any weird quirk you found annoying about the s22 ultra has been fixed or addressed with the S23 ultra.  My biggest issues with it were battery life and speaker quality, which, compared to most other devices outside of the samsung eco system, is not even a problem.  But since we're knit picking here I'll mention them.  


s23 ultra compared to the Z fold 4

the camera and processor of the fold 4 are starting to show their age (not really , but compared to the s23 ultra sure).  That's just from my preference on how I see this fold 4.  The sound on the fold 4 is better than the s22 ultra in terms of clarity, but it isn't as loud as the s22 ultra.  The s23 ultra sounds much better than the fold 4.  Not by much but I do notice the difference.  Much more clear at the loudest setting compared to the s22 ultra.  The fold 4 isn't loud enough for my taste.  And even though the camera is decent on the fold 4 I can tell it's not as quality which hurts it. 

The unfolded display is the fold 4's saving grace.  Even with the crease it's pleasant to use.   But the front display is a tragic joke, barely usable.  Samsung needs to hurry up and make that front display the same size as the ultra devices.  having a 6.8 display in the front and then being able to unfold it for a tablet size...that's my game over scenario for how samsung takes over the cell phone market.  

The chinese phone makers already have a foldable phone that's similar to what I'm talkng about, I can't remember the name but it's also very thin.  The technology is there but Samsung is getting more and more like apple with how long they'll hold off to give people what they really want.  

The Fold user interface has finally caught up to regular phone layout quality interface.  It's much more intuitive and isn't just a bigger version of what you would see on a regular phone.  They're actually utilizing the extra space.  The fold 3 had dogshit UI when it came out.  I look forward to seeing what Sammy does with the fold 5.  They actually have decent competition with the chinese phone makers so I hope that makes them get off their asses and give us something decent (get rid of the crease, built in s pen, and bigger battery, and bigger FRONT DISPLAY...that's a tall list but I can dream),

The s23 ultra is tried and true.  I can't wait to see samsung refining and improving their foldables the same way they're doing with the Galaxy regular phone line up.  I will miss the large screen of the fold 4, but I won't miss that front tiny display, it was unusable and I merely tolerated it because I could unfold it.  


Big takeaways I'm noticing with the s23 ultra.  

Samsung already has amazing wifi/connectivity/service.  But with each new phone it seems like they keep pushing the envelope even more.  Wifi connects even smoother with this bad boy.  Cell phone quality and blue tooth feel even more refined.  

Also, moving all my info between devices has gotten even easier.  It took even less time to move everything over from my fold 4 to the s23 ultra.  

Things just connect better/faster with the s23 ultra.  

Samsung has the best quality control on the planet.  Their phones are the best bang for the buck.  They aren't cheap but compared to apple you're going to get your money's worth.",1676493783.0

* All single-core scores are effectively the same; expect similar single-thread performance in bursty workloads regardless of the mode.
* Seems like there's not really any penalty for bursty workloads (even multi-core ones) for Silent vs. Quiet or Optimized vs. High Performance.  The difference between scores can likely be entirely attributed to the difference in PL1.

   * This is a bit faster than the Steam Deck's performance, so I would use that as a rough gauge if you're interested in gaming on this laptop.
   * Closest desktop GPU I could find is the GT 1030
   * Don't expect miracles, but it should be serviceable for 900p gaming (integer scaling on the 2880 x 1800 display) at 30\~60 fps on modern games.  Should handle lighter weight games easily at full resolution at 120 fps.
* Samsung Update showed three things to install: Samsung System Support Service, Windows Configuration, and Camera driver
* Camera is *extremely* wide angle.  If I had to guess maybe around 18mm?  Quality seems good for a laptop webcam
* Protect Battery is available in Samsung Settings which limits battery charging to 85%
* Yes McAfee is preinstalled :(
* There are 3 keyboard backlight brightness settings (+ off = 4 total)

* Keyboard travel is extremely shallow with a very distinct detent.  Not a huge fan so far, but maybe it will grow on me.  At first blush, I'm not typing very well.",1676485666.0

Share ideas for using the S pen,5,11342uw,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11342uw/share_ideas_for_using_the_s_pen/,2,"Samsung note/ultra/tab users, how do you use the S pen? Do you use it much? Is it important for you?

For me, it's indispensable because it's basically a mouse for my S22U. Helps with editing photos and videos, taking selfies and group photos, hover to translate is extremely helpful, and selecting text anywhere.

Perhaps most importantly for me is creating notes with chemical formulas of organic compounds and annotating carbon atom numbers within them and functional groups would've been impossible without the s pen.

Finally, studies show that handwriting, as opposed to typing on a keyboard, is better for learning and memory:

These are the reasons I chose the S23 (8GB/256GB),17,1132ff2,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1132ff2/these_are_the_reasons_i_chose_the_s23_8gb256gb/,14,"I've been using the S23 since 4th February and I can tell you it is worth it!

**- Price and where I bought it**

I bought it on Amazon Business (Spain), for 912,84€ (23% VAT included,  742,15€ no VAT), and it came with a 45W wall charger and 2 USB cables. I used the promo code SAMSUNGS23 to get 103€ of discount. By law, in Portugal and Spain we have 3 years of mandatory warranty. I made the order on the presentation day and it was delivered on the 4th of February. I had no problems since I could return it for free if I didn't want it or if the reviews were really bad!

**- Previous Smartphone and why I no longer use it**

My previous smartphone was the Poco F2 Pro 8GB/256GB from 2020. At the time and in terms of price/performance ratio, it was one of the best. Unfortunately, after 2 years and 2 months, it never turned on again. Also, in 2020, the mandatory warranty for these devices was only for 2 years. There is no luck getting them fixed for free. Since this smartphone is plagued with problems with its flex cable, I tried to change it and also the battery didn't work either. It was bricked. I sold it for pieces. Not everything was lost, at least. 

Another thing that I disliked was its software! Don't get me wrong, but MIUI is nice and easy to deal with, BUT in order to get all of its functions and updates on time (especially the security ones) I had to install Xiaomi.eu ROM (which is based on the official China Rom and no harm done to it's warranty). Sometimes it came with a lot of bugs and we had to rollback the update or only use the stable version. One really bad point was the fact it was only supported for 2 years! Even the camera app was bad IMO, most of the time I used a modded GCam

Physically, the screen was nice, nothing great, but in terms of quality it didn't disappoint me when I was watching media content, only its refresh rate (60Hz) was starting to bother me. The front camera was a motorized pop-up and I never had a problem with it. It had a 3.5mm jack and the Infrared port was really useful and these were the main specs/features I'm missing. The battery was a monster!

What I couldn't get used to was the size, weight, dim screen brightness when in direct sunlight, somewhat mediocre fingerprint scanner (especially with a glass screen protector, lack of water and dust protection, no wireless charging, bad sound quality...

As a substitute, while I was waiting for the S23 and for 3 months, I used the legendary Samsung Galaxy Gio from 2011! With removable battery and FM Radio!! Never forget what they took from us...

**- What were my options?**

* Samsung Galaxy S23
* Samsung Galaxy S23+ (Same as S23, UWB support, awesome battery life, but its size is a disadvantage for me and it was more expensive, good heat dissipation)
* Asus Zenfone 9 (very good reviews all around and one of the best smartphones of 2022, has 3.5mm jack, nice design, ZenUI is near stock android, no wireless charging, but the big no was the fact that it only has 2 years of OS support)
* Pixel 7 (This one was the main competitor for me. It's also an awesome device, slightly heavier and bigger as it sits between S23 and S23+, 700€ for the 8Gb/256Gb version, great camera quality for a smartphone, nice stock experience with zero bloatware updates, pixel devices, the first to try out new OS versions and to update, 3 years of OS update and 5 of security patchs. Why didn't I go for it? The Tensor chipsets still do not have my trust in the long term and for emulating, ""only"" 90 Hz refresh rate (not dynamic), certain software and hardware features are regionally limited.
* OnePlus 11(Bigger and heavier than S23+, only ip64, great display, OS support equals Samsung with 4 years of OS support and 5 years of security patches, wifi 7, USB Type C 2.0 (wtf?), awesome battery life, fast charging (1-100% in 25 min), but damn OxygenOS is just ColorOS at this point, I miss some OnePlus past features.

\- **The choosen one**

Samsung S23. It has everything I need

* Light and compact, damn I was tired of having a ""brick"" inside my pocket. Now, for some sports and outdoors activities, I'm not always thinking I have something limiting my movements and discomforting. Holding it, scrolling and writing effortlessly with one hand makes me appreciate it even more, it feels natural. 
* Love the screen.  Dynamic, 120Hz and 1750 nits (peak), I can see everything under the sunlight (here I'm mainly comparing it to Poco F2 pro). SMOOTH! Damn, I love moving things and scrolling. With the Poco F2 pro, by itself, 60Hz was not a problem... but when I used my PC display (at 165Hz) and had to pick up my smartphone, I always ""twisted my nose"" in disgust. The difference was too big for my liking. Once you go with fast refresh rate displays it is hard to go back.
* In terms of hardware, it's packed with some of the latest guns! Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 slightly overclocked, UFS 4.0,  the only thing I think we should have more is RAM. At least give us 12GB of RAM!!! My emulators are working beautifully (and streaming). Unfortunately, it throttles a little bit under some very heavy tasks, since the S23 is so compact it lacks the heat dissipation the S23+ has!
* IP68 is a good plus! I will not use it to take underwater photos, but having that protection in case something happens, I will be more reassured. I cannot test the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and the tougher (advertised) and scratch resistant body armor... I use a glass screen protector and a case. (more on that below)
* The cameras are not the best, for that, you must choose something like S23 Ultra or the Pixel 7 Pro. Since I take most of my photos with my mirrorless Sony A7 IV, I was not in need of the top of the line camera phone. Nevertheless, it has potential! I still did not test some modified GCam app, but Samsung has everything and processes its images at a very good level! I will test just to see if it differs. When we talk about the main camera, Pixel 7 is still a small step ahead I think (I need to test it more).
* The battery is another great point here! Better than ZenPhone 9, which was my reference for compact smartphones. Not as fast charging as OnePlus devices. This one only goes up 25W when charging with a cable and 15W wireless. I always charge only up to 85% and I try to never go below than 15-20%. I'm not having a problem since I have a very good SOT! Once I do a complete test (100% to zero) I will update this with the results.
* 912€ is not cheap!!! If you can wait for a decent sale, do so! At least I got a 45W wall charger with it and 2 USB cables (one that came inside the S23 box and another inside the charger box)
*  The under-display ultrasonic FC is accurate and FAST. I use a glass screen protector and I have no problem with it, it works almost 100% of the time. 
* Its loud speakers have so much quality when compared to the Poco F2 Pro. I can also compare it to how it sounds versus the iPhone 14 and iPhone wins, but only on the lower frequencies GSMArena has a nice chart about it. The call sound quality is also very good! Does not have the 3.5mm jack port, for some this is a big stepback, but for me it's not so bad since I use wireless earbuds most of the time... still think there is enough space for it.
* In terms of software, in the past, Samsung has been infamous. And this was the point i as more afraid! I still remember using my Note 3 with TouchWiz and the difference it made once I put it with a custom ROM. Performance with One UI 5.1, when compared to the previous versions, improves the experience to a pleasant and natural feeling and I just hope it keeps getting better as time goes on. Nothing to be afraid! But it can get better, Samsung should not be afraid of making it more lightweight!

To end this, I always use it with a case and screen protector. I have no problems with Spigen Liquid Air Case and Ez Fit Glas.tr (FC works as normal). Hope this helps some of you. Will update this once my experience changes or I have more info.",1676479756.0

AT&T stole my phone and stuck me with big monthly bill,3,112txmp,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/112txmp/att_stole_my_phone_and_stuck_me_with_big_monthly/,22,"I've been given the run around for the past year. I bought my new s22 ultra under the trade in offer that was going at the time ($800 off if I trade in my old S7 edge) I liked my old phone but thought it sounded like a good deal and they managed to convince me that I'd barely be paying any more a month for a much newer model. 

So I agreed to a 3 years contract and shipped off my old phone. 
 I was told that it would take a few months for my phone to be received and after that my bill should drop down from $88 a month to something around $50. 
 Around 3 months passed and still no change to my bill. So I called up AT&T and asked what the issue was. They told me my phone was never shipped so my bill remained the same. 
I told them that was nonsense because I'd shipped it months ago and gave them the tracking number that said it had been delivered. 
 They spent some time figuring things out and eventually 'located' my phone at a warehouse in Texas. The rep told me everything should be fine and that it was their mistake. My account was going to be credited with the money. 

Some time passes and my bill still hasn't changed. So I call them up again and they tell me it takes a couple months to take effect.  So I wait another three months. 

Nothing. 

So I call them up again and they tell me 'Your account isn't an unlimited plan so we can't credit you.'.. 

What do you mean it's not an unlimited plan? How did that happen? I traded my phone in specifically so I could get an unlimited plan at a discount? 

'But it took you longer than 90 days to get your phone to us'

Obviously that isn't true. They just lost my phone and couldn't find it in time. So I talk to a supervisor who told me the kicker. 

There is no sign of my phone ever being sent. Even with my tracking number. Even though the other guy said he'd found it. 

So I asked them to do something about it and they launched an investigation which I had to wait 5 days to hear the conclusion of. So I called them again. 

They rejected my claim. 

I sat on the phone for 2 hours with a supervisor trying to find my phone. He was super nice. He couldn't believe what the notes on my case was saying. He told me it was my right to get the money for my phone and that I did nothing wrong. It ended up being that all he could do further was to get me an exception for the price of the trade in value of the phone. Which AT&T had valued at... $35. 


So after all that. AT&T have my phone and I'm stuck paying them $88 a month for a phone I didn't even really want in the first place.

Today is the 15th. Right now, on Samsung website, it's still possible to cancel my order as the status is still processing. I'm really confused if I'm gonna get it delivered on the 18th or not.
Also, after a bit of browsing, the website now shows that the online exclusive variants may take 3 to 5 weeks to arrive. I only get more confused.
This is gonna be my first ultra phone ever, and also first preorder experience ever from Samsung so I'm really excited, and with that, kinda anxious. Please don't mind if this seems irrational to any of you lol

I should also add that I live in VN, and during check out, Samsung says delivery takes 0-3 days in my area.",1676448717.0
