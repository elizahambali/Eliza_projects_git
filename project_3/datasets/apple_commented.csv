"apple and uber have left me emptyhanded and out of pocket  209804 dollars worth of apple products stolen from an uber eats driver i recently had a terrible experience with apple and uber that i wanted to share with you i ordered an iphone 14 pro max and an apple watch ultra gps watch through apples website which were supposed to be delivered to me by ubereats i paid extra for the items to be picked up from a local apple store and handdelivered to my address the uber driver assigned to the delivery falsely marked it as delivered and never showed up despite my clear instructions and followup text messages i waited outside the entire time and the delivery wasnt ever made

i contacted apple support and although they initially agreed to replace one of the items the watch they later decided to cancel the replacement order and denied me the replacement for the phone the result of this has left me with a 209804 hole in my pocket and leaving me with no other recourse to add insult to injury unfortunately the police department is unable to file a report for civil matters

i am deeply disappointed by the lack of assistance and resolution from both uber and apple i have evidence of the conversations with the driver and video footage of me waiting for the delivery outside my building my question to the community is has anyone else ever experienced anything like this with apple and if so do you have any recommendations on how to best address this matter

i hope that my experience will serve as a cautionary tale and that both companies will take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future i realize that this is an unofficial community site for apple and while i have no expectations of this message being seen by them i wanted to raise awareness to everyone making purchases directly from the apple store especially via the use of thirdparty delivery services such as ubereats and postmates

\update 02162023\

today i spent several hours speaking with various apple representatives from the escalations team eventually i was connected to a senior manager of the online store who informed me that the investigation into the matter has been closed and that apple will not be pursuing any further investigations according to apple a delivery was made and they will not be compensating me for my losses i requested evidence that the delivery was made to me personally but the representative stated that information regarding the internal investigation could not be disclosed to me

after my attempts to contact apple and resolve this amicably i feel like i have hit a dead end and unfortunately the criminal who stole my 209804 worth of apple products appears to be getting away with the theft i am utterly speechless

i made contact with a second police department in my area who was willing to make a police report and filed this under grand theft i now have this along with the other evidence ive collected

\update 02172023\

i am pleased to inform you that a member of apples leadership team contacted me and has agreed to issue a full refund for the total cost of the stolen items  i am thankful for the opportunity provided by apple to resolve my issue however the refund process to my original payment method is still pending which might take a few days considering the holiday on monday in the us i remain optimistic that i will receive my money back by tuesday and will update this thread as soon as the entire amount has been refunded

however it is disheartening to know that the criminal responsible for this theft may get away with it sadly this is the unfortunate reality of living in california nonetheless i appreciate the effort and attention given to this matter by apples leadership team

to the apple subreddit community i would like to express my gratitude for the valuable comments feedback and advice provided your input has been immensely helpful and i sincerely appreciate your time and effort thank you all for your contributions

\update 02222023\

as of this morning my bank account has been credited with the total refund amount as per the commitment made by apples leadership team

i also wanted to highlight that despite the promise of two separate representatives asserting that the team responsible for handling losstheft of items would be reaching out to me within 2448 hours on the 16th 6 days ago ubereats never made any attempt to contact me regarding this matter"
