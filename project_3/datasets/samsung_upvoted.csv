"i have had every samsung flagship for the last 10 years s23 ultra stands with the goats note 4 and note 9 this phone is perfect i have had the note 3 note 4 note 5 note 8 note 9 note 10 note 20 ultra z flip 3 s22 ultra and now the s23 ultra

the note 3 was a great phone note 4 was a perfect beast note 5 was great note 8 was nice but not as good as the 4 note 9 was perfect from here things started to go downhill and what they improves in one area they downgraded in another eg speakers battery life processor etc

now i have the s23 ultra and i cant fault it amazing cameras amazing battery life great speakers my phone performance is amazing samsung have perfected and improved the s22 ultra what more could anyone want i am super happy with this phone  it stands out with the goats note 4 and note 9"

"after months of headache dealing with samsung customer service i took them to arbitration and won a fair settlement without going into too much detail my washer broke while still under warranty for parts but not repair labor or a refund  however every call over 5 months resulted in well schedule service when we receive parts but we dont know when well get parts  during that period i made a complaint to the better business bureau  i wasnt really expecting much to come of it because i always thought the bbb was useless 
 however samsung responded to them and after a lot of going back and forth with samsung and both of us updating the bbb on the case the bbb proposed arbitration to come to a final resolution 

samsung and i both agreed and we went through a legally binding arbitration teleconference  the arbiter decided that there was reasonable expectation that my washer would never be fixed and that i was entitled to a partial refund which samsung paid in a reasonable timeframe"
"i think i know where bixby got its name from  as far as i know theres no official explanation given nor sufficient information found online as to where samsungs voice assistant bixby gets its name from there are some suggestions that its chosen because its a unique name and does not bring any trademark issues so it was safe to be named as bixby so according to my research it was almost fully unknown well until now it might not be the actual case but im convinced its the closest guess to the origin of the name bixby 

in star trek the original series theres an episode named mirror mirror which is the fourth episode from the second season the episode was first broadcast on october 6 1967 and it was ranked as one of top ten must see episodes of the original series and one of the most celebrated ones 

in the episode we see the crew communicating with the ships computer and the computer answering questions and computing the commands given by the crew like a modern day voice assistant like bixby siri alexa 
it wasnt of course the first time computer appearing in the series so far but i believe it was indeed the first episode in which the communication between the voice assistant and the crew was this much advanced 

mirror mirror episode was written by jerome bixby a writer highly acclaimed by the critics and this was the first of the four episodes he wrote for the series 

and as a matter of fact the developers or the company was inspired by this computers advancement which was created by jerome bixby and samsung is paying tribute to him and his legacy 

im ready to be proven wrong go ahead "

"45w charger is actually worth it this year for s23 ultra 173 in 30min while the phone is on previous years the 45w was kinda not worth it  i even checked the benchmarks online the difference was literally 1 more charge in the first 30min lol  and 4 faster overall to 100 charge s22 ultra

my s23u results im using official samsung 65w charger although samsung s23u is limited to 45w

1 to 73 30min 45w charge it says supercharge 20 when plugged phone is turned onwifi

1 to 57 30min 25w charge it says super charge only when plugged phone is onwifi

sure its only 16 difference beats the 1 with s22u but mentally leaving the house with 70 battery is different than 50 p when you are in a rush

samsung is cheap though for not including it for free

edit  the full time to charge using 45w is 58min to me from 1 to 100 while phone is on

so yeah the last 27 charge takes as much as the first 73 kinda

"s23u is much snappier than s22u i recently upgraded from a note 10 to the s22u 8gb snapdragon and while the camera improvements were great everything else was underwhelming the device still felt slower than what i expected from a recent flagship

the jump from s22u to s23u 12gb is enormous everything is faster it feels like a powerful machine this is what i wanted from a smartphone"

"the truth literally no one tells you about android vs ios updates i was not sure where to post this observation but since i love samsungs version of android i would like to leave it there for people who are interested  


switcher here i was an iphone user for more than 10 years but in 2022 i switched to samsung for a second time partly because of being impressed by an old samsung phone from 2012 you will probably not believe but it still goes to internet uses latest chrome version or any browser of your choice and even installs most apps from google play and it is on kitkat 44 i mean it is the same age as the iphone 5 that already cannot open any webpage on its old ios 10 and install any app maximum that could have been installed original was ios 6 that is the same age as android 4  


generally one of the major reasons i switched was being tired of constant updates   
often i see people on the web and on reddit particularly writing that no android manufacturer has such software support as apple as an apple veteran i have went through 13 major updates on different devices ipad 1 ipad air 2 iphone 4 5 6s 11 pro and the way they serve the update didnt change throughout the years apple literally downloads it to your device without your consent when you plug the phone on charger and wifi then out of the blue often when you are very busy and do not have time for that they ask install update now or at night and you can only postpone it by clicking at night then you can delete it from storage but every time a newer version comes out  for example 1501 1613 etc it will download again  


most people will just hit install and it will download it is a hitormiss but usually every update is a slowdown comparing to the original version users often face bugs with every single update and there is no way back you cannot revert to the original version if you dont like the one that you had installed  


sure thing updates bring security better experience blah blah blah and also bring users to the store in search of a new phone it is a simple psychological trick everyone knows at apple and considering how hard it is to get free of the ecosystem users usually rush to get a newer iphone  


but what if you just do not update on iphone or ipad first two years it is going to be ok after that time sites usually start to lag and not open pages correctly or the load time increases significantly this is especially a problem of all banking apps due to them constantly updating all the site code in the same time this issue does not exist on android yes you get me right ios update means everything if you do not update you are out because all the browsers on ios are based on safaris webkit so literally if you download chrome it will change nothing except the skin sites wont open and there are gonna be even more slowdowns after 3 years developers usually drop support for older ios versions and require newer ones and 3 years literally means 3 major ios versions thus people on ios13 cannot get most new apps and app versions on their devices unless they update or buy a new iphone if their ones does not support the update  


in fact you are in matrix and are provided with two pills have a slow but uptodate iphone or have a fast but unsupported one

on the other hand on android you can install any modern app and browser even as it turns out on 44 kitkat which is the similar age as the ios 511 that is installed on my mentioned above ipad 1   


in fact getting no update on android phone does not mean you will have problems with apps and services it just means that you dont get newer os features and have a less secure phone but if you know at least something in tech does it even make sense modern android is already dummyproof enough not to allow the install from untrusted sources as well as you wont probably get anything if you use uptodate browser which you do  


in comparison how does it feel to have constant updates on apple you basically become a beta tester for anything apple wants to install on your phone you have to deal with lags bugs slowdowns and incompatibility issues and you cannot roll back to original app version like on android or just reflash the original os unless you have shsh blobs you surely wont have those at the moment you already updated and in the end you have to buy a new phone because yours does not work as you wish it to also you cannot just go and install old app apk ipa in ios from web because security and copyright unless you saved the ones tied to your apple id on your pc or mac  


i have lots of examples of how updates killed my idevices but will tell you only the recent one since 2014 i was effectively making music on my ipad i had even bought official apple lightning to usb adapter to be able to connect my midi keyboard after i installed the ios 15 update which i didnt want to do but had to one of the apps stopped updating the midi protocol stopped working synth does not connect and garageband and similar apps freeze when it tries to connect and nothing in the end like wtf i was making music and suddenly cannot and you know what is the worst i cannot go back and this device is now called obsolete so it does not get any updates or patches except some security ones that do not fix such issues now my only choice is to buy a newer ipad and hope the problem is fixed already yet i am sure it is not and the device itself is not worth it  


so next time you see anyone bragging that android has no updates show them my post and see their reaction because personally i would rather get no system updates than all these untested poorly optimised and useless yearly updates like it is on apple devices  


people who still have galaxy s3 s4 s5 and older than s10 i know you are here on this sub and i want to hear your voice please tell what is your experience in using the nonupdated smartphones is it a dealbreaker or something it is possible to live with"
