"Stolen MacBook delivery, filed a police report but Apples says I’m on my own **”Good” news: see bottom**

I ordered a MacBook Pro this Monday and I expected the delivery to arrive on Wednesday. Indeed the MacBook was _listed_ as delivered by both Apple and FedEx (the courier) but it never arrived at my apartment. Looking at the FedEx proof of delivery, it turned out that **it was signed for by a complete stranger** with no affiliation with myself or the apartment!

So I contacted both Apple and FedEx, and at Apple’s recommendation I filed a police report with the Baltimore Police Department. I called Apple again this morning in order to update them that I filed the report, and I was prepared them to give them the case number, but they said it was BPD that had to inform Apple, not me.

So then I called BPD asking if they’d inform Apple, and they said no, and I will have to forward the police report to Apple myself. I then called Apple _again_ and this time they said it was completely out of their hands, and that it was now the responsibility of local law enforcement to resolve the case. But knowing BPD…yeah good luck with that.

So now I'm $2000 in the hole and at this point the only thing I can think of that'll get me back that money is to call my credit card company to do a chargeback (or at least call Apple again to threaten one). I've seen that that's a way to get your Apple ID locked, but if that's the way a trillion-dollar corporation is willing to do with regards to their deliveries, perhaps it is worth it to be excommunicated from the walled garden.

I hope that this post highlights these sorts of issues with Apple, given that I am not the only person who has faced them (just search up ""stolen deliveries"" on this sub or on other Apple forums).

**Update (3/3/2023)**

The leasing office updated me about what they saw on the surveillance footage. At the time of the supposed delivery, there was no delivery personnel (FedEx or otherwise) going through the entrance.

I called FedEx in order to update my case with this information, as well as provide them with my leasing offices’ contact information. I also called BPD in order to let the office submit the footage as evidence in the police report.

**Update 2 (3/3/2023)**

The leasing office contacted me again a few hours after the previous update saying that a shipment to my name had arrived. And indeed, it was my MacBook - the tracking number and the serial number matched up, and the laptop had arrived in working condition. ~~I’ll still have to update FedEx and BPD about this resolution.~~ Updated both of them to close their cases.

That said, **this whole experience remains completely unacceptable.** Most egregiously, FedEx should not have let a complete rando sign on my behalf, then mark the package as delivered when it wouldn’t actually arrive for another two days. And Apple should not have been so hostile to the customer when the delivery of their item has failed.

Ultimately I expected a far better experience from a company that markets itself as a premium brand, and I had to waste two and a half days dealing with and worrying about delivery shenanigans and potentially having to initiate  chargebacks or legal action. Plus it’s not my own time that was wasted - I’m sure the leasing office, the BPD officers working on my case, and my friends who were helping me all had better things to do.

For present and future Apple customers, unless you have no other options (e.g. you live in a remote area), **do not consider Apple delivery.** Other Redditors have stated this advice in the comments below, and now I will join them in repeating it."
iPhone 15 Pro's Next-Gen Chip Capabilities Expected to Spark Upgrade Demand Among Current iPhone Owners ;
"Apple Should Support iCloud Drive Backups to Time Machine BLUF/TLDR: Apple should make Time Machine capable of keeping local backups of data that has been offloaded from your device due to iCloud Drive's Optimize Storage option.

Apple has Time Machine to support local backups.

Apple offers Optimize Storage with iCloud Drive for those who have limited local hard drive space.

Unfortunately, any files MacOS decides to not keep locally due to Optimize Storage will also not get backed up to Time Machine nor other backup solutions that I'm aware of thus reducing those files offloaded to iCloud in a ""one copy state"" and at risk of data loss that can be caused by a multitude of things including user error.  Also changes made to those files on other devices will never make it to Time Machine unless you access that file on the Mac connected to Time Machine causing MacOS to download the file again.

I understand there are folks who have data caps and can not spare the possible excessive data movement which could be caused by such a system but I'd love to see Apple offer an option to get around this.

Just give us an option, along with a warning that the feature could cause excessive data usage, where Time Machine can temporarily download a file from iCloud Drive to back it up then remove the temp file.  It would only need to do this once for the most part as any files you are actively changing after that point would be downloaded anyway.  For files modified on other devices iCloud could use a Modified tag just like local incremental backups use so Time Machine could grab the most recent update for backup.

I dunno, I know this is full on TLDR material for a lot of folks but I'd love if I could get more people to think about this and maybe the community can start giving some pressure that Apple could eventually respond to.  I'm going to submit my suggestions to Apple but one dude ain't going to change the flow of Apples development."

"Off my chest: Macs drive me crazy. /rant

I don't know what happened at Apple. They stopped caring about user experience on the Mac. They stopped caring about pushing the platform forward. Today, Macs are just a source of frustration, excessive barriers, half-baked features, strange workarounds. You name it.

* The macOS permissions system is a complete joke. Mac developers have to develop entire user tutorials just so average people can figure it out.
* <App> would like to send notifications.
* Stage Manager is a garbage feature on a desktop environment stuck with 2007 era window management.
* Bluetooth mice and keyboards still work like shit on macOS, unless they're made by Apple.
* Mouse scrolling acceleration is what could be considered, JANKY and BROKEN.
* Mouse acceleration in general feels like crap. Can't disable. 
* Why can't I set trackpad scrolling direction independently from mouse scrolling direction?
* How TF do I capture desktop audio without a kernel extension that breaks system integrity?
* Why is finder such a complicated PoS with obscure icons, strange workflows, disorganized views, complex and inconsistent states, and weird defaults?
   * Scrolling in gallery view doesn't scroll the gallery. WTF??! It's literally the worst view ever.
   * Why the heck is icon view always disorganized. It looks like a big pile of shit for most people, because they don't know how to use it. Or you change views and junk just moves.
   * If you open a DMG, it removes your sidebar and toolbar. Then when someone goes to open a Finder window, they find this useless DMG window where they can't navigate anywhere. Then they have to close the window or know the random hidden view keyboard shortcuts..
* Updates take FOREVER.
* Dragging stuff into folders on launchpad is frustrating and buggy.
* Full screen views and window decorations make no sense, because I swear there are 20 different implementations of window decorations (stop lights) on macOS alone, before you even install any third party software. Super inconsistent.
   * Multi-windowing is so janky on macOS. Some apps can be open without a window open. Some apps close when the window closes. There's no good way to organize the many window instances of a single application.
* All of the Catalyst apps ported from iOS are garbage tier second-rate software. Home app.
* There's a bunch of random hidden functionality with obscure keyboard shortcuts. For instance, they have hidden ""Save As"" behind the option key in all Apple software.
* No system-wide volume mixer. Why??
* The App Store is where software goes to die. Or rather, where it goes to charge $5/mo some stupid task. The App Store is useless. The number of good apps on the app store can be counted on one hand. Apple has caused the max exodus of the app store which makes it no better than Windows. At this point, the Microsoft Store is way more useful because it allows browsers and open source software. And, you know, despite all of the bragging about how Apple ""loves"" their developers, I almost NEVER see new interesting, high quality, curated software. Even Windows has a package manager these days, which makes macOS, second-rate, dated.
* External monitor support SUCKS on macOS, especially for MacBooks.
   * The HDMI ports on M1 Macs are janky, dated, and don't support VRR, HRR, or HDR. I don't know why. It is inconsistent.
   * macOS has all sorts of problems with waking external displays.
   * There is no way to use a MacBook with an external display and the lid closed unless it is plugged in. How hard is it to give a setting?
* Where TF are the sleep settings?
   * I only see two options in energy saver
      * Wake for network access
      * Start up automatically
   * Turn display off when inactive is not auto-sleep settings
      * wtf?
* Widgets are awful.
* If you're a developer, you probably know that installing Xcode Developer Tools tests anyone's patience. Downloading the compilers and supporting software for macOS is a PITA.

And so on...and on...

A while back I considered macOS a decent user experience. However, this isn't the case any more. 

Will Apple ever actually fix this stuff? Because macOS just feels like a legacy system bloated with all sorts of crap.

"Dont trust iCloud with your Data! (lost many files) First of all I know that its kinda my fault for storing all of my documents only in iCloud but I somehow trusted Apple to keep my data safe after an old harddrive broke and I didn't wanna get my own nas system.

Two days ago I realized that almost 900Gigabytes of my Data in iCloud was just gone.   
All Folders were still there, only the files in the folders were missing.

I immediately  looked into my ""recently deleted"" folder in iCloud but there were no file in there.

Since I didn't know when or how my files were removed from my iCloud (which only I have access to) I contacted Apples support.

The Apple support told me to go to [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) and try the ""Data Recovery"" thing on the bottom of the site.

The ""Restore Files"" thing on [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) found 5000 deleted files that were to be permanently deleted in 2 days. So i instantly got to restoring those files. The website wasnt made to restore many files at once tho, so i had to restore them in packs of around 100files.   
Every time I reloaded the website the counter went back up to 5000 since there were much more than 5000 deleted files on my account.

After 2 days of almost continuous file restoration i was finally done...  
But most of my files, especially the important ones were still missing...

The (very nice) person from the apple support created a high priority ticket for the technicians in America to look at my case and get my files back.

Sadly the support rep called me a few minutes ago with the information that the techs finished the restoration... which by itself would be great news if not almost all of my files were still missing.

&#x200B;

So to sum it all up, I was stupid and trusted Apple that iCloud is a safe place to keep my data and now have lost more than 900gigs of photos, memories, documents and have no way of recovering them. (state registration card, purchase contract of my car,  rental contract of my flat, childhood photos, photos/memories of deceased relatives, all of my programming work from school, and so on)

So please always save your important files in multiple places and don't trust big companies to keep your data safe.

&#x200B;

(they should definitely add the feature that OneDrive already has which sends you a notification if large amounts of data got deleted from your cloud storage)"
iPhone 15 USB-C Accessories to Have Limited Data and Charging Speeds Without Apple's MFi Certification ;
"Lack of accountability at Apple I'm massively annoyed by the lack of accountability. After an in-app purchase didn't work, the vendor recommended that I'd get in touch with Apple for a refund. Despite providing evidence of the vendor themself asking me to do it, Apple refused the refund. I appealed, same result.

You’re not getting a reason as to why they refuse the refund. You also don’t get to state your case. It’s complete bs.

I contacted my bank, who had their legal department review the case. They concluded that I was entitled to a chargeback. They then contacted my card provider, who again had their legal department review the case and conclude that Apple was wrong in withholding the refund. 

Apple then blocked my app store account without telling me, resulting in me not being able to update apps and close security vulnerabilities. After I got in touch with Apple support, they re-enabled my account.

My card, however, remains blocked; I can’t use it anymore in the App Store or with Apple Pay. Apple support isn't interested in the case. When I raise this issue in the community the posts get removed.


My learnings from this case:

1.	Avoid Apple in-app purchases wherever possible because Apple doesn't like accountability
2.	Use a throw-away card that I don't use anywhere else on Apple so that it quickly can be replaced."

I remember shortly after we took those photos she had told me she didn't like the live feature and I remember myself responding with something along the lines of ""I like to keep it on cause it might capture something special that I'd like to look back on later you know?""

It was honestly a nice reminder to never take anything or anyone for granted, and to cherish both the little and big things in life because they could easily disappear in the blink of an eye.

"What could Apple do differently for iCloud password resets There's been many recent conversations about the impact of a thief taking your phone and knowing your unlock passcode (either through shoulder surfing or forcing you to divulge it).  Apple needs to find a very difficult balance between: 
1.	Your data being kept safe from other people 
2.	You being able to get your data back even if you stuff up by forgetting or losing something 
3.	Respecting privacy and trust expectations, particularly with end to end encrypted data 
4.	Doing the above for the majority of the population that is technically incompetant, forgetful, often doesn’t read or follow basic instructions, and doesn’t plan ahead... 
  
Even with Apple’s current implementation we see many more people losing access due to forgotten passwords or broken/lost devices or out of date recovery info etc, vs the kind of theft being addressed here.  Forcing users to know the current password before changing it can’t be implemented without also removing the other password reset methods that trust the same device (eg. pushed 6 digit 2FA codes).  The net impact would be to significantly increase the number of people losing their data or at least being very unhappy at the delays of Account Recovery. 
  
While the obvious best move is for users to use longer alphanumeric passcodes and/or be careful who is looking when entering the passcode, most people won’t do this and the real world is messy (see #4 above).  I know, I know, personal responsibility and all that but it is what it is. 
  
Some PROACTIVE steps Apple COULD take, however are:
1.	More user education & warnings (eg. a “Security checkup” notification in Settings every 12 months - remind user about the passcode’s critical importance, check&update trusted numbers, recommend using Recovery Contacts, re-enter the Recovery Key to see if you’ve lost it etc) 
2.	When resetting the iCloud password or changing 2FA settings - *IF* a 28 digit Recovery Key is already set, require EITHER the current icloud password OR the Recovery Key to be supplied.  This enhances security for users who have decided to enable the recovery key, but some other people are going to lose their accounts by accident because they lost their recovery key and password... 
3.	[terrible idea] Add an optional separate passcode for the keychain.  This will lead to some people losing their keychains the same way people lose password protected notes and complain about it despite the warnings they’re given.  The extra passcode can also be extracted from you at gunpoint.  I hate this idea a lot - IMO its better to let people choose to add a separate password manager if they want, and remember this information can still be extracted from you by force - there is no way to avoid this. 
4.	[terrible idea] Add a “This device is trusted” setting. Disabling this blocks the device from changing iCloud security settings and receiving pushed 6 digit 2FA codes, or iCloud SMS 2FA codes being sent to it.  It can only be re-enabled via a different device logged into the same account, or with the Recovery Key.  I hate this idea too, its a nightmare. 
  
And some REACTIVE (post-theft) steps Apple COULD take are:  

5.	 Allow the Account Recovery process even if a Recovery Key is set, IF the recovery key was created in the last 1-2 weeks  
6.	Allow old (reset) Recovery Keys to be used for 1-2 weeks  
7.	Allow password resets via deleted Recovery Contacts, IF they were deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
8.	Allow use of an old trusted phone number for password reset or Account Recovery, IF it was deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
9.	For arbitration of 6/7/8, successful use of an old item invalidates newer items of the same type"

"Apple needs an option to ""trust"" certain Airtags Whenever I hang out with my friends one of us end up with a notification that an Airtag is moving with us.

Find My will only let us dismiss it for 24 hours and won't let you nickname them.

This is a big issue because we just ignore Airtags alert now, assuming it's about a friend's Airtag. So if someone were to actually track us with one, we would think anything of it.

"I'm a doctor and just released my first app – a responsive mindful breathing app for stress & anxiety Website: https://www.lungy.app
App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/lungy-breathing-exercises/id1545223887

Hey guys!

Lungy is an iOS app that responds to breathing in real time, transforming your breath into a playful, interactive experience. I started working on it in 2020 during the first UK lockdown as a way to make breathing exercises much more fun and engaging. It's initially a wellness app, but hopefully at some point it can be developed into a platform for people with breathing problems (asthma, COPD and long COVID). I think it really makes the most of iPhone hardware (it should run on iPhone 6S+), with real-time cloth, fluid and rigid body sims all running on the GPU. You can also even create your own music using a synth and sequencer (go to Settings/Create Music).

There are obviously lots of breathing and meditation apps out there, I wanted Lungy to be different - it's about tuning into your surroundings and noticing the world around you, so all the visuals are nature-inspired or have some reference to the physical world. I didn’t like other apps required large downloads and/or a wifi connection, so Lungy’s download size is very small (<50MB), with no geometry, video or audio files.

"What made you switch to Apple? I was seeing an Apple add in Reddit and I was thinking. Why Apple spends money in ads? Don’t they have a strong fan base? When I jumped to Apple was mostly to have a reliable ecosystem. Previously had a huawei ecosystem (laptop, cellphone, tablet and headphones). But the cellphone would get issues with bank apps too often, my smart watch would glitch, and really small details that just slightly annoyed me.

"What is the best alternative to guake terminal in macOS with the most closed-in look and functionality? Hi Apple Community :),

I came from Linux (ubuntu), and now I have macOS and am a software developer, so I use the terminal a lot. I have used Guake Terminal in Linux because of its functionality and looks.

I am searching for an alternative closed-in look and functionality to the Guake terminal in macOS.

Functionality:

1. Multiple tabs
2. Ability to customize switching to a specific tab with a keyboard shortcut (like in guake)
3. Top-down terminal
4. Keyboard shortcuts like F12 to open and close it

If there is any option also closed-in looks like the same design/theme as the image below, I will be happy: [https://www.tecmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Guake-Linux-Terminal.png](https://www.tecmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Guake-Linux-Terminal.png)"
Remembering Steve Jobs on his 68th birthday ;
Luxshare ICT likely to lead development and production of Apple’s first-generation AR/MR headset ;
"My hate-love relationship with the HomePod as a music enthusiast I hadn’t paid much attention to the HomePod since the initial release because it was limited to be an Apple Music streaming box. I started looking into it when I heard about the new release. But more importantly, the possibility of using a pair as a stereo AirPlay device in macOS.

It had been a while since I was looking for the perfect transportable audio setup, as I am always on the go. I like neutral sound; at home, I have KEF LS50 speakers with a NuPrime amp and the go Campfire Ara IEMs with a Dragonfly DAC/amp. Finding a good comprise that would allow good sound and the possibility of being transported in a suitcase by plane was challenging. I had been thinking of going with an Apollo Twin and small bookshelves from either PreSonus or Neumann. But it was still a lot of weight, and the setup would not go very low.

I went to the Apple Store for a listening session, but unfortunately, laying HomePods on a table 50 cm below the ears with ambient noise does not do the trick. I ended up coming back home with two.

After setting them up as pair and selecting the output in macOS, I opened the Audio Midi Setup to check the bitrate and depth. I was pretty sure I heard AirPlay2 was bringing lossless, but there are some nuances ([Apple AirPlay 2 supports 24-bit lossless audio, but you can’t use it | digitaltrends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/apple-homepod-24-bit-lossless-audio-airplay-2/)), and we are stuck at 16bit 44.1kHz. Figure out the logic behind being in the ecosystem (streaming from a MacBook or an iPhone) but still being software lock to the lowest quality. Cherry on the cake is bye-bye streaming the ALAC library, their own lossless codec.

Sound-wise, I admit it’s impressive! They sound way bigger than they are,  the soundstage is excellent. The high feels pretty bright, and the mids are clear. But when it comes to the base, although they are well-defined, they are way too pushed. I check the setting in the Home app to discover that there is an option to reduce bass. It sounds way better; it leaves room for the rest, but it feels like a straight cut below 70Hz. So we are stuck between choosing overkilled lows or no bass; it feels incomprehensible, given the potential of the hardware.

Even with these unpleasant surprises, I will keep the pair of HomePod because it corresponds best to my use case. It’s an unbeatable form factor for the sound, the DSP is great, and the setup is frictionless. It would not take that much to make the HomePod appealing to a broader audience with a software update that:

* Allow lossless streaming via AirPlay from any Apple device
* Add an EQ setting for the HomePod in Home app"
"Ecosystem question from an oblivious ex-user Hi,
I see so many YouTubers that just keep on saying the same thing over and over, that ""Apple devices just communicate well with each other"". I used to have some Apple devices back then, but I definitely did not see any ecosystem magic happening. My parents have the latest iPhones, Apple watches, Apple TVs but they apparently don't see anything either. But that may be because they aren't searching for it.
These days I myself am a Pixel user. The Pixel also has an ecosystem and I would like to find out how the Apple one is to compare, since I heard it's better.

So I decided to go here to ask for some nice examples of Apple devices working well together.


-----------
Update:
Thanks for educating me. Just to summarize what I learned, I decided to create a sort of ""Venn Diagram"" in text.

Apple only: using iPad as second screen, handoff (clipboard, files), stats from watch on AppleTV screen, using phone as webcam (although this is coming in Android 14), AirDrop with PC, signing phone documents on PC

Both: Headphone audio-switching, controlling TV, Find My, Synced texts between PC, phone and watch, ""AirDrop"" (in quotes because it's called Nearby Share on Android), Cloud sync, Password manager integrated into OS, Photos app syncing between devices, unlocking device with another device, AirPlay (Chromecast on Android), home devices automation (turning off TV when you're not home for example) - this last one requires set-up, continuing websites from computer on phone or vice versa, scanning documents to PC, transferring calls to other devices easily, starting maps on watch when phone navigation starts and vice versa

Google only: Headphone audio-switching on Windows, Synced texts on Windows, Touching 2 devices to wirelessly transfer files, being able to open Android apps on Windows and them syncing with your phone apps, USB tethering (extremely underrated, low-key amazing)

I think I put everything you guys mentioned in here. Thanks for clarifying, from what it seems, the gap isn't really big.

"Does Apple notify if if a pair of 2nd Generation AirPods Pro’s has been following you? 
Like, if someone’s trying to steal a car that costs tens of thousands of dollars or something, a pair of AirPods Pro’s seems like a small investment, which they’d also get back if the car was stolen, or, if someone is obsessed enough with a person, they could just use AirPods to track them. Yes, it’s not nearly as discrete as an AirTag, but it’s still not that difficult to hide if you try, especially in a car. The battery won’t last that long, but I’d still be creepy.

I haven’t lost my pair yet, so I can’t say if this is how they work, but Apple claims that they can be precisely tracked."
"I asked ChatGPT to summarize the changes in recent iCloud terms of service. Can finally be informed and not just blindly click accept. Edit:  **Read my update below before believing this.**

Thank you for providing the previous version of the iCloud terms and conditions. I have compared it to the current version and here are the key changes that I have identified:

* Section 1 (Terms and Conditions) has been updated to clarify that the agreement governs your use of iCloud and any related Apple services, products, and software.
* The previous version of Section 2 (Your Account) included a subsection on the use of Touch ID and Face ID to access iCloud. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your Apple ID.
* Section 3 (Use of iCloud) has been updated to include a subsection on iCloud Backup, which allows you to backup and restore data from your iOS or iPadOS devices.
* The previous version of Section 4 (iCloud Services) included a subsection on iCloud Keychain. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead includes a subsection on ""iCloud Private Relay,"" a new feature designed to enhance the privacy and security of your internet activity.
* Section 6 (User Content) has been updated to include a subsection on Live Photos, which allows you to share animated photos with others through iCloud.
* Section 10 (Apple's Intellectual Property) has been updated to clarify that Apple may use feedback you provide about iCloud to improve the service.
* The previous version of Section 11 (Indemnification) included a subsection on the use of Touch ID and Face ID to access iCloud. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your Apple ID.
* Section 12 (Dispute Resolution) has been updated to include a subsection on class action waivers, which prohibit you from bringing claims against Apple as part of a class action or consolidated action.

These are the key changes that I have identified between the previous version and the current version of the iCloud terms and conditions. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other changes that I did not identify or that are less significant.**

Later Edit:  **As embarassing as this is, I'm going to leave this up instead of deleting it. But I've learned a valuable lesson in AI being ""confidently incorrect"" or better more accurately, bullshit it pulled out of its ass.    I would have expected this to be a start to understand the terms better but in manually comparing them, there's not even the words ""biometric"" anywhere in the new terms nor ""face id"" and ""touch id"" in the old terms, to pick a simple but glaring example.**"

"Announcing Notifications Has anyone had any success getting their iPad or Apple Watch to announce notifications out loud?

I’ve been experimenting with this Announce Notifications. On my iPhone 14, I successfully got it to start announcing notifications from some of my most important applications. I went through the process of toggling on Announce Notifications, selecting those apps that I want it to announce notifications from, and then toggling on Announce Notifications on Speaker.

I followed the same process on my iPad Mini 5. Yet despite me toggling on the same buttons, etc. that I did on my iPhone, my iPad Mini doesn’t announce the notifications. Again, this is weird because I did the same thing on my iPad Mini, that I did on my iPhone, which now successfully announces the notifications I want it to.

Also, I toggled on the Announce Notifications button on my Apple Watch, and selected the apps I wanted it to do so for. But yet, my Apple Watch is not announcing the notifications.

Am I missing something here? Some steps? Any insight into why my iPhone successfully announces notifications but my iPad and Apple Watch won’t?

Thanks!"

"Voice to text recently became so bad it is unusable for business. My experience is that about five years ago Apple's voice to text was pretty good save for some minor fixes it needed.

Nothing has changed with my voice, though I did buy an upgraded iPhone.  But what has coincided with updates over the last two years is that its voice to text got a lot worse - then, very recently, it became garbage tier.

It's little wonder why I see so many drivers texting now - we can't rely on the phone to not make the other party pissed off.  But it isn't merely while commuting - it's also in the calm work environment.

And what's with it constantly trying to leave a space between the period at the end of sentences?  What's with commas placed in nonsensical places?  I'd much rather it skip trying to punctuate my voice than punctuating it badly."

I am currently on 50% left with ~4hrs SoT, which is roughly an estimated SoT of 8hrs. That's good I guess? 
I didn't have to recharge through the day yet. I go to bed with 30-50% left after a total 15-17h of activity and ~5hrs SoT.

"One of the rare times where a product leaves you amazed I have owned the AirPods Pro for a while and upgraded to the 2nd Gen when they were released. I haven't had any issues losing any gadgets in a long while (knock on wood!), so in early January when I was traveling for work and staying in a friend's apartment while he was away it was disappointing when I couldn't find my AirPods. ""Find My"" had listed them at my location a mere 45 minutes earlier, but they were nowhere to be seen. I figured my streak had come to an end and I went out a few days later to replace them (they never popped back up on the map and I had them okay a sound and never heard anything).

Skip ahead to 6-7 weeks later and I had just arrived back at my friend's apartment for another work trip. I always pay for a professional cleaning after I stay there and I walked in to find two earbuds sitting on the counter near the washing machine... ! I felt a pit in my stomach and searched the washing machine for the case and eventually found it in the dryer, sticking to the ceiling. *The AirPods had been washed and dried. * 

I reached in and, trying to look on the bright side (they weren't lost, after all), collected the case. I opened it up to take a look and was shocked to see the light go on... And then my phone vibrated and let me know that my AirPods had been located! Could it be, could they be functional? I put the earbuds into the case and plugged it in to charge. 

Thirty minutes later came the moment of truth--I unplugged them and put them into my ears. The familiar tone sounded and my phone connected to them! And then, I went to Apple Music and ... They sounded perfectly normal! After having been lost for over a month, during which time they were fully laundered, it was as if nothing ever happened!

Maybe I shouldn't be impressed... But I am. To go through that sort of ordeal and still work perfectly well could easily be luck (and it probably is!), but it still shows a level of quality and reliability that I don't readily associate with other brands or products.

Anyway, I don't know why anyone should care about this trivial story, but I thought I'd share so my positive experience is noted and in case it helps anyone to hear it."

"Flat iPhone with a good camera or Huge camera bump with a great camera? There’re some leaks that says the camera bump of iPhone 15 Pro will get even bigger.

If you’re into non-pro iPhones, what do you prefer the most?

1) 
Flat iPhone with an acceptably good camera (better looking iPhone without a huge camera bump)

or

2) 
iPhone with an exceptional camera but has a massive camera bump"
"Screen time for kids sucks Every day I have to set screen time for my daughter and everyday it shuts itself off and resets itself.

Every single day no matter what I do.

I have  attached a link for the video of it literally resetting itself the second I set times.

I'm convinced that I shoould switch back to Mac, but my question is: how stable is this software/feature? Does it crash? Does it cause the computer to lack or use up too much RAM?

"It sucks that Apple Pay Cash and Apple Card not in Europe With many online fintech companies in Europe that support Apple Pay, big banks like HSBC, and Credit Suisse. It remains still a mystery that Pay Cash at least isn’t available here. 

I would close most of my online bank accounts if I could just use Pay Cash. I understand that the Apple Card cannot come here as we are less keen to get credit cards and there are rarely any here plus the higher regulations they’d have to deal with. 

It’s my hope that one day Apple would decide to not leave any more untapped market on the table."

I would like to understand whether I am missing out on some features on LiDAR that some of you have been making use of. Currently I don’t have the iPhone or iPad Pro, so no LiDAR, but considering for te next model. 

I haven’t seen any articles or YouTubers talking about this, perhaps I am part of a particular bubble that just doesn’t seem to find this useful. I know that apple stock camera, the measure app and some accessibility functions make use of it. However more interested whether some applications that really depends on it, it’s a bit strange that such feature is made so mainstream but I don’t see any pone talking about it.

Thanks.




Update so far:
Beside what I mentioned the apple stock app above (camera, measure and accessibility), apparently used for

-	 extensive and maybe daily use by people that need to measure 3D objects
-	dimensions of an interior (floor plans, house or even caves). Mainly personal use, but also business use
-	medical profession to scan body part
-	drone scanning of grounds

Note: some shared some interesting info about LiDAR use in general, I was particularly interested for the iPhone/iPad, since I am planning to get one."
"Apple's Standard Warranty Surprise I purchased a 5th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro in November. Apple's standard warranty expires in August '23 for this unit. It was sold to me as excellent condition, which it was when I received it. It was much brighter than the 4th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro that I also have. I purchased a 6th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro recently. All purchased used, 'Open Box' on eBay. 

As I was synchronizing the settings of the 6th GEN side-by-side with the 4th and 5th GEN units, I noticed that the 5th GEN was much brighter than the other two. Now I realized that on the 5th GEN *True Tone,* a feature of these iPads, wasn't activated yet. But it was! That's when I realized it wasn't functioning! I called Apple and the result was that it needed a repair that was covered under the standard 12 month hardware warranty. So I sent it in to Apple.

I was just informed by Apple that the repair could not be made because there was another problem with the device. The USB plug receptacle was damaged and that it needed to be replaced. That type of damage is not covered under the standard warranty. My choices were to not have the repairs done, or to let Apple keep and recycle the unit or, cough, pay $799 for the repair.🤮

I used that unit daily since November. I experienced no problem with the USB plug receptacle. Yet here I am. This is not a complaint. My days of complaining are over. I will accept the unit back of course. I'm curious to see what, if any, difference there is with the USB plug receptacle when I receive it back! If it is returned as I sent it in, I can do without *True Tone.* When the 7th GEN iPad 12.9 is released, I'll get that one too.

I always get AppleCare+ but the unit needs to be within the time frame that one would qualify to purchase AppleCare+. This unit was beyond that time period.

Warranties of any kind, from any company, are not black or white. They are gray. In this matter, for me, it is insignificant. But for a hard-working young person who struggles to get along in life, I believe this would be a big disappointment. My purpose for this post is to make readers aware, to expect the unexpected; to always be prepared."

"Iphone 8/plus is peak design Hear me out. 

Even though I'm usually an android user, I always tried out some apple products, including iPhones (I'm a tech fan, I do not stick to only one company) 

But the early iPhones always kissed my eyes tbh. 

I'm currently rocking an iPhone SE (22) next to a P6P, and I may stick to the iPhone for a longer period. 

I LOVE the Design with homebutton. It feels and looks so timeless and elegant. 

My biggest wish would be that apple keeps doing the SE lineup in this design or even add one in the Plus-Size like the 8 plus. Maybe put an OLED in it, but I'm fine with the IPS retina as well. 

I love that you can hold this phone without being on the screen instantly, I don't know what it is, but I prefer this sleek look with a square display over the modern, almost bezel-less designs. 

I can't be alone with this"

"beware ordering same day delivery I ordered a new macbook pro for my company. It was to be delivered to my house by postmates/uber within a few hours. I received a text saying get ready for your delivery. Then a text saying your delivery is arriving. A guy came to my door w/ an apple bag, showing my name and address and order #, and my new computer was taped into the bag. He asked me if my name was ? I said yes. He had me sign for the delivery. I took the bag and shut my door. I received a text saying my order was delivered. A few minutes later, he rang my door again. I don’t know why I answered. But I answered, and he said he had delivered to the wrong address and he must take my computer back from me, please hand it over. WTF? I said no, this is my computer, I paid for it, I signed for it, I have all the payment and delivery receipts. He kept insisting and implying that I was a thief. I got my husband involved. My husband tried showing the guy the bag proving this is the correct address and he needs to leave. The guy kept threatening saying he’s going to ask one more time then he will call the cops. I told him to call the cops then, and shut the door. 

He called the cops, I called the cops, they came, were super bored w/ the whole thing, it was clear the delivery guy was in the wrong, they showed him the actual bag he gave me that the computer was in, that listed my name and address and order#, proving he was at the right address. The cops said the guy then apologized to them and drove away. 

But I was left shaking and nerves a mess. So I called apple to let them know what happened w/ their delivery. The lady on the phone was horrified and apologetic, said that should never have happened, told me I did everything right disengaging and contacting police, that the guy handled it wrong. She said he is not law enforcement so if he thought he made a mistake he had no authority to go demand my computer back from me, he should have contacted apple and they would have easily and quickly confirmed that he delivered to the correct address. 

So going forward I am going to just pick up my orders myself rather than trust Uber drivers, and highly recommend for others whenever you can."

"Just released a major update to Dime, a beautiful and intuitive personal finance tracker and budgeting tool. Now with income tracking, overall budgets, UI redesigns and more! Hey r/apple! Hope you’re having a great weekend.

TLDR: [Dime 2.0](https://apple.co/3ANcqCN) is here with income tracking, overall budgets, a UI makeover and more! It is a beautiful, intuitive expense tracker built with iOS design guidelines in mind. And, it's 100% free with no ads or paywalls.

Nearly half a year ago, I launched Dime 1.0 as a project to kickstart my programming journey, and was taken aback by the response. I am immensely grateful for all the comments, reviews, and feedback I have gotten ever since, majority of them being from this subreddit!

The most requested feature by far had got to be income tracking. I was initially rather reluctant to add this in as it would essentially require a complete overhaul and migration of existing data models and the UI built around them. Additionally, I felt it would diminish the simplicity of the app that many users had grown to love. Nonetheless, with the help of the 300 beta testers on TestFlight, I was able to experiment with different integrations of this new feature, and eventually landed on one I was really satisfied with.

Today, I’m proud to present Dime 2.0, its biggest update thus far. And of course, no changes to the pricing model - still a 100% free with no ads, paywalls, or data collection.

💥 What's New in V2.0!

-	The feature requested in almost every support email - income tracking.
-	Redesigned input interface that minimises excessive swiping if you have many categories.
-	Redesigned category list with category suggestions and the ability to reorder categories.
-	Rebuilt the Insights page to minimise lag and crashes.
-	Lock screen widgets for iOS 16.
-	Overall category-less budgets!.
-	Added interactive line graph to the Home page (turned off by default, can be accessed via Feature Lab in Settings).
-	Insight filtering configuration now persists between sessions i.e. if you configure your Insights page to show monthly statistics, it will stay that way from then on (and not revert to the default, which is weekly insights).
-	Added triangular indicators to the budget bar graphs which show the optimal spending percentage.
-	Option to have a more compact Budgets page by swapping the grid for rows.
-	Custom time frames (e.g. 3 days, 5 weeks, 7 months) for recurring transactions.
-	Swipe to delete transactions.

🥰 Why You’ll Love Dime

-	100% free forever, with no paywall or ads.
-	Beautifully iOS-centric design, with simplicity at its core.
-	Insightful expenditure breakdowns over various time periods.
-	Create budgets based on expense categories and stick to them.
-	Create recurring expenses with custom time frames.
-	Sync your expenses, categories and budgets with other devices via iCloud.
-	Custom reminders to input your expenses.
-	Biometric authentication to protect your data.
-	Home screen quick actions make capturing new expenses a breeze.
-	A gorgeous night theme for dark mode fanatics.
-	Informative home and lock screen widgets keep you updated at a glance.

I genuinely hope Dime will be able to help you cultivate prudent expenditure habits. Any feedback or thoughts is welcomed, and appreciated. Moreover, if you have found Dime to be useful, it would be incredibly helpful if you could give it a great review on the App Store. Am unable to afford marketing for a free app, so ratings and reviews are my best bet at spreading the word about it.

A special thanks to all those who have generously tipped the app, all proceeds will go towards my upcoming Apple Developer subscription cycle payment 😊

Have a great week ahead!

"iOS 16.3 can delete data on your iPhone/iPad without asking - I've lost 2500+ books Hello,

In Feb iOS 16.3 has deleted all my 2500+ books from Apple Books on iPad. ePubs and articles in PDFs, which were sorted in many categories.

Probably, it has happened because my iPad's storage was full and iOS had decided to delete books instead of caches, offloading apps or deleting iCloud photos (which can be re-downloaded from the cloud).

Without informing the user, of course. iCloud wasn't enabled for Apple Books. No JB.

Here is the story:

I was browsing in the evening, when my iPad has turned off - the battery was empty. I've connected the charger and left it till the morning. In the morning iPad was up and running, I was using it as usual. Few hours later I've opened Apple Books and it was empty: no books, no covers, just empty collections. Checked iPad Storage tab - 50Gb free space (this space was occupied by Books) and Apple Books with 0MB for Documents.

Ok, going to logs - nothing unusual. Silence. Ok, I have a full iTunes backup, not the freshest one - 6 months old, but better than no backup at all.

I was able to get into my iPad to make as low-level examination as possible.

What I've checked:

    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases - empty, all books were deleted
    BKLibrary - empty, only categories
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases/Purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases/Backup-Purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Sync/Books.plist - some titles and filenames, but not all

I've identified when books were deleted - at 03:52:

    BKLibrary (recovered records):
    Table ZBKCOLLECTIONMEMBER
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;

    .....................................................
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;

Then I've spent almost 1,5 weeks digging in iOS internals and I was able to identify the key suspect - some sort of ""experiments"", which iOS executes on user devices:

database of AppleMediaServices was cleaned by iOS, so traces were hidden, but I was able to recover some data:

metrics.sqlitedb was hiding this (50+ events when my books were deleted):

Bingo! Time is the same as in BKLibrary when records (and books!) were deleted.

So, iOS has silently deleted all books.

Later I have written a custom parser, which examined 2 600 000+ rows of raw data of some internal indexes, which iOS uses and it helped me to recover some info: titles and file names.

Still a long way to combine all findings for recovery.

Findings:

* iOS 16.3 can delete all books without asking
* iTunes Full Backup is not backing up sideloaded PDFs & ePubs in Apple Books
* When Apple Books app is backed up via iTunes, BKLibrary database is vacuumed, so no deleted data inside.
* No info is logged about deletion - but I'm checking for extra evidences
* Logs are clean: no suspicious activity
* There are no single place with metadata for Apple Books - I'm assembling info piece by piece from many places in iOS: databases, logs, activity data, thumbnails etc. 90% manual work.

I'll make a new post later, including all details related to my Apple Books forensics and recovery.

&#x200B;

P.S. Keep in mind that iOS can delete any data anytime - do manual backups. iCloud can fail as well - imagine losing years of private photos..."

Hi all, I thought it would be cool to use AI for something fun, so I made an [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jester-ai-caption-writer/id1661372840) that writes **Instagram captions for you using just an image**—including puns, jokes, and hashtags. It usually gets the captions right and I’ve been pretty astonished by how funny some of them can be.

How it works is you pick any photo (no sign-in required) Jester generates four unique captions. From there, you can choose your favorite and edit it as you wish. If you're not happy with any of the captions, click the retry button to generate four more. You can also add context, use the photo location, or generate more variants of any caption. When you're happy, you can copy the caption, share it, or post to Instagram.

Captioning 5 photos is free every day and there's a paid subscription for Unlimited captions (because running AI models is expensive), but I will share a promo code for a **free year with the first 5 people who comment** with a caption written by Jester! If you're not one of the first 5, don't worry because you can have 1 free month using the code [SUNDAY](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY) which can be redeemed at [https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY) (on iPhone or iPad)

P.S. I understand the importance of privacy for people's photos, so Jester does not keep or store any images at all."
"Why is changing the display refresh rate so difficult?? Changing the refresh rate for an external display is so g\*dd\*mn difficult... literally have to hold down the 'option' key to bring up some kind of 'hidden menu'. And half the time it doesn't even work!!! 

Apple--why do y'all do this?? What is the point of this hidden menu that has to be activated by holding down some key--and it doesn't even work half the time!! It just seems like a really silly UX decision... super unintuitive. What could possibly be the logic behind building a hidden menu that is only visible while holding down some random key? Is this another example of Apple hating on power users and treating their users like children? I mean really... the only reason I can think of is aesthetic, they must not want the preferences window to be too cluttered. If this is the actual reason, lord help us...

This is what I'm talking about: [https://www.makeuseof.com/change-display-refresh-rate-mac/](https://www.makeuseof.com/change-display-refresh-rate-mac/) This sh\*t only works about half the time, the other half, the refresh rate doesn't even get displayed after holding down 'option'"

"What is the best application for customize keyboard shortcuts for macOS? Hi Apple community :),

I am new user to macOS system, I came from Linux (Ubuntu 20) and Windows 11, and I saw macOS keyboard shortcuts are different and also not all the keyboard shortcuts that available in Linux or Windows can be done with macOS, and hence I ask you what is the best third application for customize keyboard shortcut for macOS for my following needs:

1. Launching application from the dock by keyboard shortcut 'Windows key + number' (like in Windows 11)
2. Selecting text and paste it with mouse wheel click (like in Linux)

I believe in the future I will use much more keyboard shortcuts, I really love productive tools.  
I will be happy to hear from you on recommendation apps.

Note: I don't have problem to purchase an app, but this is must worth it."
"Clean installation of Ventura appears to automatically enable FileVault -- no recovery key supplied? When setting up a new machine or updating to a major release, one of the first things I do is enable FileVault. In the past, it has always thrown up a modal dialog giving me the option to copy the recovery key, which I always do.

I upgraded two machine this week. Using a USB installer, I wiped the SSD clean and started from scratch. Upon first login to Ventura, I went to enable FileVault. It was already enabled, and at no point was I ever given the recovery key. Apple Support has no answer other than ""turn it off, then turn it on and get a new recovery key"".

Great that they are trying to strengthen data protection on macOS; bad that they have left people in the dark on how to recover if something going wrong. Disabling/re-enabling is bullshit.

Anyone else seen this?"
"iPhone Upgrade v. Trading In This question has been asked many times, but I haven’t seen anyone mention the trade in specials that seem to happen every time a new iPhone comes out. With the iPhone 14, I think (may be mistaken) every major carrier offered it free if trading in an iPhone 13 Pro. Presumably something similar can be expected for the 15. So doesn’t it make the most sense to just always buy the newest iPhone and trade it in for potentially 100% off the next one, rather than enroll in the IUP? A bit of risk but it seems minimal, and you’re probably going to get a good trade-in or sale value even if not 100%. I must be missing something here - anyone have any input?"

"iCloud backup overrides whatsapp in app backup so what’s the point in of people backing up both? By making a iCloud backup your saving everything on the iPhone - a copy 

If you were to make a WhatsApp in app backup a couple of days AFTER your latest iCloud backup, then have to reset or transfer your device and install from that said iCloud backup it would load the iCloud WhatsApp backup that’s 3 days old ? Not the newest in app backup that was made in WhatsApp that was made 3 days later ? Because it’s saved on the drive itself ? 

So essentially iOS will always load the iCloud backup before the WhatsApp in app backup ?

Edit - so turns out if you disable the icloud backup from the old backup delete the app then reinstall it it lets you load from the new manual backup"

"I got ask to set up a recovery key but I already have one (Advanced Data Protection) - Anyone else having issues with ADP and recovery keys? I've enabled Advanced Data protection about two weeks ago and set up a recovery key before hand. The recovery key setup was always extremely buggy. After creating one, most of the time it would still say that I haven't set up a key yet. Sometimes it works for a day, and then it shows ""Off"" again for the recovery key in the settings. After some time I was finally able to also enable Advanced Data Protection (always got the error ""Unknown error occurred while enabling Advanced Data Protection"").

Now about two weeks later, with Advanced Data Protection and Recovery Key both enabled, I suddenly got a notification on my Mac saying ""Account recovery method needed"": [https://ibb.co/8rpnCkQ](https://ibb.co/8rpnCkQ)

I clicked on it and it created a new recovery key instantly, without asking me again.

What is going on with this whole Advanced Data Protection and Recover Key mess? Anyone else having issues with that?

Honestly I'm at a point now that I don't even trust the Recovery Key to actually work when I need it. Since something must have triggered the message in the screenshot above, even though I already had a key set up. And all the issues before with having set up a key but not being able to activate Advanced Data Protection or showing the status of the recovery key as ""Off"", even though I had it enabled."

Apple flexes lobbying power as Apple Watch ban comes before Biden next week ;
"Apple Watch 7 compatibly I had to downgrade my phone from 11 to a 6s. On the apple forums it said this phone was compatible with a watch 7. But when I went to pair it with the 6s it said I didn’t have the right version of iOS on the phone. It’s been updated to the latest version it can.

Was going to try and pick up an iPhone X on the cheap but now I’m concerned it won’t work.

Does anyone know first hand if the X will work. The info on the internet doesn’t seem to be reliable.

"Has anyone else noticed a huge increase in the amount of spam they get in their iCloud email addresses? I keep an Apple/iCloud email address because I've had it since the days of [mobile.me](https://mobile.me) and, in fact, have a tiny little user name on it. So I use it for the sole purpose of whenever anyone says ""what's your email address?"" I can say ""I'm [pdc@me.com](mailto:pdc@me.com)"" instead of ""I'm P O R K C H O P UNDERSCORE D...""   


But, recently, I've noticed I'm getting a ton of the worst kind of spam from that email address - obvious phishing spam, obvious ""Congratulations! get your free Harl3y-Davids0n motorcycle"" type spam.

"Apple Store Repair and Service is Really Dissapointing This is a bit of a rant, 

I spent a large part of today driving to and from the Apple Store to get my companies older 2015 15” MBP looked at. Random shutdowns on battery have been happening for a number of years but it hasn’t been a priority since it has been plugged in most of the time. We’ve recently brought someone new on and wanted to give them this Mac to use - but they need something reliable while being away from power. 

I was pretty sure the battery was the issue, but I did not want to get it replaced only for it to be something more serious like the logic board. We’re a small company and need to be smart about our expenses. The battery cycles are 280-300 for a 7 year old computer. I spent 30 minutes on Apple Chat last week and they recommended going in-store to get it looked at where they can do more in depth diagnostics. It’s a 40 min drive each way, but if it helps illuminate the issue then its worth it. 

First off, everyone at the Conestoga (Canada) Apple Store was very nice. My complaints are not about their direct service but the corporate policies they have to follow. 

They ran a diagnostic on the laptop and it came back with 80% battery health. They ran the diagnostic plugged in. I had it unplugged a couple of times at the Apple Store and it would shutdown as it usually does when the battery is sub 60%. In the rare cases where it does not shut down the battery drops really fast. 

I am more than willing to pay for the battery to be replaced. But, in order to replace the battery on the 2015 models they need to replace the top case (keyboard, trackpad). **Because the battery health is at 80% (and not 79% or lower) - they can’t replace the battery without charging me for a top case replacement! **The battery fee as quoted on their website is $250 (all prices in Canadian dollars), but with the mandatory top case replacement it jumps to around $700. Not worth it for a 7-8 year old computer. 

What frustrates me is, the Apple Tech in-store had no agency in the matter. It was clear as day the battery was failing and leading to restarts. Yet his own system would not let him order the battery replacement without the top case charge being applied because it was 1% over the required number for it to be eligible. His best solution was to use the laptop on battery as much as possible until it hits 79% and then to come back to get it fixed. Driving 40 mins each way again in the hope that they will replace the battery seems like a bit of a fools errand.

Over the last couple of years I have had other repair needs (Apple Watch battery, AirPods Connection issues) and the experience always ends up being the same. The people at the store can see the issue, but have no agency to get it fixed. 

This laptop in particular, was purchased at the Apple Store for $2500+ CAD, plus Apple Care +. We never used Apple Care before it expired and now we’re being denied a battery replacement (without paying the extra fee) because the health is 1% off replacement level according to their diagnostics. Yet the real world performance is clearly failing at a basic level. 

I am a little late to the game in getting Apple Devices, but my impression was that Apple had the best service and while they charge a lot for their tech - the support is top notch. That simply has not been my experience in any interaction I have had with them in the last 3-5 years. I don’t know if this is a Canada issue, or all Apple Stores. But I am just do disappointed in the entire process. I don’t have a lot of free time and to waste it on something like this is really frustrating."
"iPhone silent switch should be able to switch to a focus instead of just silence. Would love if I could set the silent switch to change to the “Do not disturb” focus for example. Switching between different focuses would be really great.
This would allow for some people to still call through while everything else is silenced.

Sadly the only options that silence has is whether haptics are left on.

"what happens if i downgrade my icloud storage, and what is the difference between not paying/not downgrading and downgrading? first of all, here are some key points of information that you'll have to remember in my case  
1. i'm currently using the 200gb icloud storage plan, but i plan to downgrade soon (within around a week) in order to not have it required to be paid monthly (due to financial reasons)  
2. my iphone only has 64 gigabytes of storage; it is a pre-paid phone (which cannot be returned) and i do not have any other devices that are able to fully download all of my icloud storage  
if i were to downgrade my icloud storage from 200gb back to the default 5gb, what will happen to the rest of the data that exceeds it? (keep in mind that my iphone only has 64 gigabytes, and none of my devices have enough storage to download all of my icloud storage) if my photos won't sync to my icloud storage (uploading), will it still load the full-resolution images (downloading) when i view an image on my iphone that has been shrunken down to the optimized size?  
i read an article that said:  
""if you stop paying for your icloud storage, you will receive a pop-up on your phone telling you to pay. if you refuse, you will have 30 days to get your data from the cloud before it's erased permanently. if in those 30 days you decide to keep paying, all your stuff will remain there.""  
i have questions about this:  
there are 2 routes that are in question:  
1. the route where you simply do not pay for icloud storage and do not downgrade (which has already been specified that one will have 30 days to download all of the data before it gets wiped)   
2. the route where you downgrade your icloud storage to the default 5gb (which it is unknown to me what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb) to not have to pay monthly anymore  
for the second route, i wish to know what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb once i downgrade my icloud storage; what will happen to my backups? will my photos still be read from icloud storage (for full resolution)?  
tl;dr: i have very valuable data on my icloud storage that, due to financial reasons, cannot be kept paid monthly, so i plan to downgrade my icloud storage, and i can't download all of my icloud storage to any of my devices because they don't have enough storage either, so i ask 3 questions:  
1. what will happen to the data that exceeds the default 5gb?  
2. what will happen to my data backups?  
3. will my photos still be read from icloud storage (meaning that will the optimized saved photos on my iphone still read the full resolution videos and images placed on icloud)?"
"Genius Bar is a horrible experience and a complete waste of time. Unfortunately I've had a lot of issues with my apple products this year and have had the unpleasant experience of dealing with apple support.

In early January, my M1 iPad Pro 12.9"" stopped charging about 16 months after purchasing. Now I am an electronics hobbyist and I know a thing or two about troubleshooting and I did all I could without opening the iPad. When I contacted apple support they told me I needed to make a Genius Bar appointment and the only ones available in a reasonable timeframe were during the work day. So I took a couple hours off to drive out the the apple store only to have to wait an extra 30m after my appointment time for the ""Genius"" to check the USB port for dust and verify it wasn't charging (Something I already did before) before telling me I was screwed and a replacement would be $800. I ended up taking it to a third party repair shop and they replaced the USB C port for $200.

Recently I noticed my AirPod Pro 2 case battery was draining about 20-25% per day without even using the earbuds. Apparently this is a common problem that multiple people report having. I called Apple and they guided me through resetting the device and told me to call them again if the problem persisted, so I did. When I called them again after testing, they told me I could schedule a Genius Bar appointment and get a replacement. So I repeat the process and drive out for the appointment and the ""Genius"" takes my AirPods to the back to run some tests. When he comes back out after 20m he tells me he could not find anything wrong with them and that my options were to live with the problem or send it in to an Apple repair center. I opted to send them in. We'll see if Apple lives up to their warranty or not...

Either way, each of these appointments took about 1h30m of my time only to have Apple's Genius representative to tell me to pound sand. In both of my experiences, the in-person representatives I met were unhelpful, uncompassionate, and slightly rude. Apple products cost way too much to have this poor of a support experience

&#x200B;

Edit: I forgot to mention. Apple will not ship my AirPods back to me from their service center. I have to spend another 60-90 minutes in order to go to the Apple Store to pick them up again"

"Apple's $3000 Laptop: A Heater or a MacBook Pro i9?  Hello everyone,

If you're a MacBook Pro user, you may be familiar with the issues that have plagued the 2018 i9 models. Despite the significant price tag, these laptops suffer from severe overheating and throttling issues that can make the computer nearly unusable.

Many users have reported that their MacBook Pro i9s will overheat and then slow down or shut down to prevent damage to the system. This problem can occur even when the laptop is not under heavy load, making it difficult to use for even basic tasks.

What's even more frustrating is that Apple has remained largely silent on the issue. Despite numerous complaints and even a petition signed by over 11,000 people, the company has not taken any significant action to address the problem or compensate affected customers.

It's not right that users have to spend so much money on a product that fails to live up to its promises. It's even worse that Apple hasn't faced any consequences for this issue, leaving users feeling frustrated and unheard.

So I'm asking you, fellow MacBook Pro i9 users, do you think it's right that Apple hasn't faced any consequences for these issues? What steps should the company take to address the problem and make things right for affected customers?

Let's raise our voices and demand action from Apple on this issue. Our hard-earned money deserves a laptop that works properly. Thank you for your time and attention."

"Recommendations to improve Apple Health's Medications feature # *TL;DR - Let's create a singular master thread of requests, to send to Apple, for Apple Health's Medication functionality.*

I was so excited by the new Medications offering in Apple Health. As a chronically ill person who has more than 12 medications to track (and often change) every day, I was relieved that Apple would finally offer us something that I wasn't getting from 3rd party apps, as well as the bonus of smooth integration across my Apple devices (really important for my physical disabilities). 

The initial offering is ok, but it has HUGE potential. I've no doubt Apple already has a long list of features and changes they plan to make with the functionality but I know from a product development standpoint, it's really important that they hear from the consumers which requests are most vital. I'm not entirely sure if they have, or plan to, consult with people who have chronic or complex health issues, but I do feel it's important we let them know they could really help improve our lives with a few tweaks. 

This realisation led me to start submitting through their [Health feedback form](https://www.apple.com/feedback/health/). Unfortunately there is a character limit and I know that most people will not submit a form for every single suggestion. I personally gave up after the first 5. So I've come to the conclusion of creating a master thread that can be shared with them directly. That's what I'm hoping to achieve here. 

If you use the Medications feature, or even just tried it but didn't continue, please have your say. If someone has already made a suggestion you agree with, upvote it! Please also include your country, as functionality currently varies and will be helpful to give context to your feedback/suggestion.

Thank you in advance 😊"

"Apple and Uber have left me empty-handed and out of pocket - $2,098.04 dollars worth of apple products stolen from an Uber Eats driver I recently had a terrible experience with Apple and Uber that I wanted to share with you. I ordered an iPhone 14 Pro Max and an Apple Watch Ultra GPS watch through Apple's website, which were supposed to be delivered to me by UberEats. I paid extra for the items to be picked up from a local Apple store and hand-delivered to my address. The Uber driver assigned to the delivery falsely marked it as delivered and never showed up, despite my clear instructions and follow-up text messages. I waited outside the entire time and the delivery wasn't ever made.

I contacted Apple Support, and although they initially agreed to replace one of the items, the watch they later decided to cancel the replacement order, and denied me the replacement for the phone. The result of this has left me with a $2,098.04 hole in my pocket and leaving me with no other recourse. To add insult to injury, unfortunately, the police department is unable to file a report for civil matters.

I am deeply disappointed by the lack of assistance and resolution from both Uber and Apple. I have evidence of the conversations with the driver and video footage of me waiting for the delivery outside my building. My question to the community is, has anyone else ever experienced anything like this with Apple, and if so, do you have any recommendations on how to best address this matter?

I hope that my experience will serve as a cautionary tale and that both companies will take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. I realize that this is an unofficial community site for Apple and while I have no expectations of this message being seen by them, I wanted to raise awareness to everyone making purchases directly from the Apple store, especially via the use of third-party delivery services such as uber-eats and postmates.

**\*Update 02/16/2023\***

Today, I spent several hours speaking with various Apple representatives from the escalations team. Eventually, I was connected to a ""Senior Manager of the Online Store"" who informed me that the investigation into the matter has been closed and that Apple will not be pursuing any further investigations. According to Apple, a delivery was made, and they will not be compensating me for my losses. I requested evidence that the delivery was made to me personally, but the representative stated that information regarding the internal investigation could not be disclosed to me.

After my attempts to contact Apple and resolve this amicably, I feel like I have hit a dead end, and unfortunately, the criminal who stole my $2,098.04 worth of Apple products appears to be getting away with the theft. I am utterly speechless.

I made contact with a second police department in my area who was willing to make a police report and filed this under ""Grand theft"". I now have this along with the other evidence I've collected.

**\*Update 02/17/2023\***

I am pleased to inform you that a member of Apple's leadership team contacted me and has agreed to issue a full refund for the total cost of the stolen items.  I am thankful for the opportunity provided by Apple to resolve my issue. However, the refund process to my original payment method is still pending, which might take a few days considering the holiday on Monday in the US. I remain optimistic that I will receive my money back by Tuesday and will update this thread as soon as the entire amount has been refunded.

However, it is disheartening to know that the criminal responsible for this theft may get away with it. Sadly, this is the unfortunate reality of living in California. Nonetheless, I appreciate the effort and attention given to this matter by Apple's leadership team.

To the Apple subreddit community, I would like to express my gratitude for the valuable comments, feedback, and advice provided. Your input has been immensely helpful, and I sincerely appreciate your time and effort. Thank you all for your contributions.

**\*Update 02/22/2023\***

As of this morning, my bank account has been credited with the total refund amount as per the commitment made by Apple's leadership team.

I also wanted to highlight that despite the promise of two separate representatives asserting that the team responsible for handling loss/theft of items would be reaching out to me within 24-48 hours on the 16th (6 days ago), UberEats **never** made any attempt to contact me regarding this matter."
Apple Exploring Viability of Foldable Devices With Touch-Sensitive Chassis ;
"I am going Watch Only in my Day to Day Life. If Apple gave us iPad and/or Mac integration I would throw my phone in the trash. Feeling the fatigue of Smartphone addiction I got a cellular Apple Watch Series 8 and put it in the Drawer for the last week.

EDIT: Put the Phone in the Drawer Last week. Sorry for being vague. 

I love it. There is something liberating about being able to go out in public and not having the whole wide world of the internet in your pocket. If you are careful the watch battery will last all day and you get your calls, texts, as you would on your phone. Apple really should lean into the Watch being the Phone for people who are sick of their phone. I use my iPad when I ""need"" apps. But otherwise I do not think that I will return to full time smartphone usage again.

EDIT: to save on battery I actually found that Sony still makes dedicated MP3 Players not connected to the internet to offload listening time. Its like its 2005 again."

"Optimized Battery Charging I'm considering taking the free iPhone my company offers - which I previously always declined.

Right now im looking into it again and am checking for the features and apps/ workflows that apparently don't ""just work"" with iOS.

One example is the smart charging. There seems to be a feature for determining how one uses his phone and then charging it till 80% and only completing the charge once the used algorithm deems it the right time. Right not I only charge my android for a few minute a day so that i reaches about 80% and have hard capped it there. Due to the slow charging speed iPhones I would charge it overnight and therefore need this feature to work properly.

From what I found online this system doesn't seem to work that well and on my girlfriends XR it deems 3AM the perfect time to be fully charged... 

So why is there no setting to set a specific time for the phone to be fully charged or even better, have it depend on the set alarm time of the next day? Is there a way to set these obviously needed settings and I just didn't find them?

Are there other ways to fix this?"

"iCloud removing metadata from photos So I recently decided to download a bunch of old photos from my iCloud account to my hard drive, going back years. You can only download 1000 photos max at a time, so this took awhile. Anyway I finally get my photos going back years and to my surprise, all of the metadata for location and time has been stripped! 


Instead of having the time the photo was taken in the metadata, it just shows when they were downloaded from iCloud now. Totally sucks. Is there a fix for this? I’m assuming not."

"Whats the point of 2FA if you can just change your password on your iPhone without it? (Medellin gunpoint robbery) Just read a terrible story in Medellin Reddit of a girl in a city park getting tossed down a hill and robbed.  They made her write down her Apple password.  Then of course they changed the password on her Apple account.  Apple is of no help recovering her Account and of course the phone is gone, etc.

After being glad the girl is OK, I thought for sure that I was protected from something like this because I have 2FA.

Nope!  When you head to settings, it says, ""Because you are logged into iCloud, you can change your password.""  No 2FA!  Then it says ""you want to log out of all your other devices?""

Every other little thing I log into, for instance the New York Times that I signed up for using Apple's anonymous email service, requires me to use 2FA.  

So why when changing the password am I not required to do any 2FA?  Is it because if you lose your password they could just send it to your email which is on your phone anyway?  

Is there a way to truly theft-proof your phone?   Because when a gun is pointed at you, its a good idea to fork everything over including passwords."

"Inconsistencies with ""the ecosystem"". The integration between Apple devices is really great. Notes, reminders (more on that later), unlock your devices with the watch, airDrop etc. It would be really hard to switch back to PC/Android as it doesn't really have any of that. However...

Apple watch can unlock my iPhone and MacBooks but not my iPad. One of my laptops is 7-8 years and my iPad is the latest pro with m2.

The Books app knows my position in ebooks across devices but for audio books (bought in the apple store) it doesn't sync. Also, if I'm listening to an audio book on my iPhone there is no indication of this in ""playing now"" on my Apple watch.

If I leave my computer somewhere that isn't my home and then leave I will get a notification on my apple watch that I left it behind. If I leave it at home I don't get that notification. So far so good. But even if I go out for a walk with the dog I will always get a notification that my iPad is left behind.

If I listen to a song on Apple music on my phone and pause it then tell Siri on my watch to continue playing music it will play whatever I played on my watch before.

Alarms set on my phone will sound on my watch. Alarms set on my watch will not sound on my phone. This one I actually kind of like but it would be nice if there was an option to only have the alarm ring on certain devices depending on focus model. I probably shouldn't get started on Siri since she really suck, but a small thing like ""set an alarm on my iPhone"" get the response ""set the alarm for when?"" ""1 minute"" ... alarm is only set on your watch, not your phone. 

I never get any reminders on my iPad. iPhone, Apple watch and macbooks all do.

Is this intended behaviour and I'm just not ""getting"" it? Are there any workarounds for any of my niggles? I'm open to third-party apps, especially for audio books since I really dislike the Apple audio book interface in general."

"There is something wrong with the Mouse, Cursor, and Magic Trackpad 2 in M1/M1*/M2 Macs. This is gonna be quite a long post but **if you are also affected by the mouse cursor stuttering and jumping, either with the internal Trackpad or with the external Magic Trackpad 2 feel free to chime in and share your results, experiences, workarounds etc.** Anything that would help the community to overcome this issue.

&#x200B;

# Background

I bought my first arm-based Macbook Air 2 years ago as a backup device. My main workstation was still my Intel Mac. Whenever I used the M1, I noticed some cursor stutter after about 20 minutes of working or so. It's like the refresh rate for the cursor suddenly drops to like 24fps.

This is NOT the general slowdown that you experience when the CPU is busy or the memory is full. It can happen when doing nothing but clicking through items in the finder with nothing else ressource-hungry going on in the background,

What ""fixed"" it for a few minutes was to close the lid, open it again, maybe repeat that a few times and the cursor was back normal. This has already been discussed a lot in threads on Reddit and I'm surprised to find the exact same issues still being present after more than 2 years of arm Macs.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago I had to upgrade my main workstation (Intel MacBook) to an ARM-based Mac. I set up my Magic Trackpad on it. Of course, each new device can feel weird at first but after the first hour of using I noticed that I am still kind of unsuccessful at hitting buttons, marking text etc.

\- Everything felt imprecise,- the refresh rate would randomly drop like I know it from my 2020 backup mac,- additionally, the cursor would take random jumps of like 5cm/ 2 inches across the screen.

My productivity dropped as I had to second-guess and correct each cursor movement to get there where I wanted to get. My wrist started hurting on that very day (wrist joint issues were the reason I had to purchase a Magic Trackpad 2 a few years ago in first place and I absolutely loved the Trackpad ever since).

&#x200B;

# Radio?

I had somewhat similar issues when first moving to a USB-C Mac (the first Intel that required dongles for HDMI, USB etc.) when using a third-party dongle as this has disturbed the radio on the Mac. So back then I bought the original Apple dongle as well which solved these radio issues (also discussed in great extent across reddit).

This case here is not about radio tho, I also experience these issues when not being connected to an external screen, and not having the dongle plugged in.

&#x200B;

# Third party apps?

Some forum post said that third party apps cause this, so based on Apple Support's advice I went into safe mode and only used Safari for my work, no external screen, no other apps opened: Same results.

&#x200B;

# Comparison with Intel?

Thinking I'd go crazy I placed my old Intel mac at the exact same spot on my desk to see if this suffers the same problem. I was blown away at how smooth the Magic Trackpad cursor was on my Intel Mac. It felt like it had twice the refresh rate, twice the precision and none of the pain that comes with using the arm Mac. I need to mention that the Intel and the ARM Mac have the same apps installed because I transfered the whole installation from the Intel Mac to the ARM Mac.

&#x200B;

# Comparison with other Macs?

As I know the next step would be a replacement device, I was curious whether that would fix things. To cancel out any issues with apps on my ARM Mac, or with my ARM Mac's hardware even further, I've tried a few friends' ARM Macs (these friends also all know the cursor refresh rate issue on their ARM Mac but don't use a Magic Trackpad). Needless to say, the exact same issues started happening with my friends' computers as well. I attached my ""old"" arm backup Mac and the issue happened on that device as well. To give a short summary:

&#x200B;

\`\`\`

M1 Air 2020 on macOS 12.6: Problems

M2 Air 2022 on macOS 13.1: Problems

Intel Pro 2018 on macOS 12.6.2: NO Problems, smooth cursor

\`\`\`

(Tested with more devices too but this cancels out any macOS version issues)

&#x200B;

# Radio part 2 - connection via cable?

Then I found this thread:

[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363) (21 “Me too”)

For testing, I’ve connected the Trackpad via a lightning cable. It is way better that way. Is it possible that the radio in the MacBook Air M2 is much weaker or placed unfortunately? It really isn’t usable with the arm-based MacBooks.

However, the connection via cable isn't perfect either - While working, after a few days suddenly the cursor was unresponsive, the Trackpad couldn’t move or click for a few seconds. After that, it went back to being so wonky again, as if the cable wasn’t attached. Frame rate of the cursor also seemed lower and everything felt indirect. As if the mouse driver went into some kind of compatibility mode that doesn’t do any of the magic that cursor tracking usually involves. Like toggling mouse acceleration in Windows, it feels completely different and weird suddenly. As soon as that happened, I started mis-clicking buttons again because I constantly either overshoot cursor positions (like going past the button that I intended to click) or undershoot them (not reaching the desired cursor position in the first move). Temporarily moving to the Intel Mac, I hit everything as precise as I used to do. To cancel out any bias, I also did tests where I didn't know which device I was connected to and I could always tell the smoothness of the Intel vs the awful navigation in the ARM.

&#x200B;

# Internal Trackpad?

Apart from that, as mentioned in the beginning I also often see the cursor stuttering even with the inbuilt Trackpad. It’s like the refresh rate of the cursor drops:

[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253713321](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253713321) (221 ""Me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253395232](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253395232) (173 ""Me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252777347](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252777347)[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252957160](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252957160) (91 ""Me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253672108](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253672108) (64 ""Me too"")[https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/qj77mq/cursor\_lag\_continues\_on\_monterey\_m1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/qj77mq/cursor_lag_continues_on_monterey_m1/) (109 upvotes)[https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/u486mi/macbook\_pro\_13\_m1\_trackpad\_cursor\_lag\_issue\_no/](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/u486mi/macbook_pro_13_m1_trackpad_cursor_lag_issue_no/) (125 upvotes)

&#x200B;

# Trackpad / Radio / Cursor delay?

Additionally, I've taken slo mo recordings to measure the delay between my finger moving on the internal Trackpad + external Magic Trackpad and the cursor moving on screen with both processor architectures - I can't find any significant delays that way either. So it doesn't seem to be a latency issue.

&#x200B;

# Verdict

My best guess till now:

* ARM Macs have another set of mouse drivers, causing the refresh rate to drop
* ARM Macs have another set of mouse drivers that have different curves for interpolating and accelerating signals.
* ARM Macs have some additional radio issues, that don't cause all of the problems, but add to them

In any case, my wrist hurts. Doing the lightning cable thing already helps a lot but I still need to restart the computer every few days due to the above-mentioned issue of the cursor messing up even on lightning. Also, even with the cable attached, it still doesn't feel as direct and smooth as on the Intel Mac.

&#x200B;

# How to go from here?

I've spent way too much time on this problem already but I'm required to use a macOS device for work and right now it looks like I will have some bad time ahead in the next few years if there is no solution in sight. If you have any info to share, let's work together to be either to either find a workaround, or gather enough information so Apple can finally acknowledge the problem and address it."
"iPhones are not the same anymore I am a long-time iPhone user. For the simple reason that it comes with software that simply works. But somehow that was apparently the case. In my opinion, this is no longer the case. Since IOS 16, I have noticed that the iPhone has more and more bugs in everyday life. I can put on my Beats headphones and my iPhone can't wake up for like 5 minutes or so. Widgets are not displayed correctly or partially not at all, once I couldn't even open apps anymore, only one key combination helped to force a shutdown. This is very annoying, as the devices are really very expensive.

I have similar problems with my iPad.

What are your experiences? Are Androids now more stable than iPhones?"

"There are few things more frustrating than getting to the gym, putting your airpods in to find that one is dead and the other is low I realize this is a first world problem, and that you could say “well, you should have charged them”, but how hard would it be for Apple to implement a notification that triggers when you place airpods into their case but the case doesn’t have enough charge left to bring them to 80% or more?

Seems like a simple solution."
"Elephas - Personal AI Writing Assistant for Mac, iPhone, and iPad (Ver 5.3 released) Hello [r/apple](/r/apple)

I am an independent developer from India.

I have built an app called [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-promo-sunday-1202-01), a personal AI Writing assistant that works seamlessly across all your Mac apps, as well as an AI-enabled keyboard for your iPhone and iPad.

Just released a new version of the app last week.

Update: Elephas and ChatGPT are not the same; they have slightly different use cases. Elephas applies an AI layer on top of your Mac while you continue to follow your workflow.

**Version 5.3 Updates:**

In the latest version, I have released features such as -

**Snippets -** Configure shortcuts to perform day-to-day tasks with the help of AI. It supports all popular languages. You can do tasks across your apps, including editors and spreadsheet tools.

**Tones** - To personalize text output and write in your own unique style.

**Preserve Formatting** - So that the generated text maintains the format and styling of the original text.

And many more tiny improvements and utilities.

# A brief overview of the tool -

First off, very pleased to share that now 500+ professional users use the app every day :)

Elephas helps business professionals use AI to save time on day-to-day tasks. Emails, documents, blogs, JIRA stories, social media posts, etc.

Our users praise it as a Swiss Army knife for their daily productivity.

**""An AI tool that they actually use in their daily workflow""**

It differs from other AI tools in that it works on top of your favorite apps, so there is no need to switch between windows or work in a browser window.

You can get the power of AI within your favorite Mac apps like Mail, Pages, Docs, and any other apps built for the Mac.

With Elephas,

*   You can rewrite your content, improve it or even generate new content on a topic.
    
*   You can use it to quickly reply to your emails, messages, and social media posts.
    
*   You can even use it for creating presentations and generating excel formulas.
    
*   And now you can even define your own tasks with the ""Snippets"" feature.
    

Based on our user requests, I introduced the AI assistant to iOS devices (beta).

It follows the same philosophy, wherein you can use the writing assistant without leaving the app you are writing on.

So you can use an AI keyboard within Whatsapp, Mail, iMessage, etc.

Here's the demo of how the AI keyboard works -

[https://youtu.be/Y5vrH3Clgyo](https://youtu.be/Y5vrH3Clgyo)

There is a wide range of utility features built into the app to make your daily workflow smooth and fast with the power of AI.

**One last point**

The app is privacy friendly. You can use your own OpenAI keys, and none of your data is stored on our servers.

You can check out the tool on the website here -  [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-sunday-promo-1202-02).

There are a whole lot of videos here in this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpv207Ven3s1Hmfcq9lqG74eRzJicbmoy).

**You can try the app for FREE for 30 days.**

I will appreciate your support and feedback.

Thanks."
"Switch from all Apple apps? I’ve been thinking of switching from all Apple Apps to something I can access from all platforms. I was looking at platforms like Google Drive/Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, Todoist, etc. This would enable to me to access my data regardless of what device I’m using.

Thoughts? Do you use services from other companies? Which ones and why? Do you use just Apple? If so, what keeps you there?"

Hey, I upgraded my iPhone 12 Pro to iPhone 14 Pro Max. 

Bluetooth gets stuck pairing (It shows loading near the gadget) every time I need to pair my iPhone to a Bluetooth device(AirPods or a PC…). I need to turn off the Bluetooth and turn it on again. I experienced the same issue on all my iPhones.

There is some stuck command in Bluetooth, and iPhone does not proceed with the following pairing requests (Bluetooth commands) because it is busy solving the stuck thing. The issue remains until I re-toggle (turn off and on) the Bluetooth."

"App Store review dates are sorted by Most Helpful by default (which is usually too old, at least >2 years) I'm not sure whether it's intentional or it's a known bug. But by default App Store sorts reviews by Most Helpful. So this is really annoying. When I decide to install an app, I usually see the top 1\* to 3\* reviews from at least 2-4 years ago. Which absolutely doesn't make sense to me. Those comments could be outdated and obsoleted. For a concrete example, jumped to the Subway Surfers page and notice the latest update is 2d ago. But the top comments are from 4 years ago. I DON'T say ""Most Recent should be the default"", but more than I'm looking for much smarter sorting like how Play Store do with ""Most Relevant"" option. Also there is no option to filter only ""latest version"" reviews. Could you please enlighten me? Thanks."

What Apple learned from skeuomorphism and why it still matters ;
"I hope/suspect Apple isn't letting another AI opportunity slip **Generative AI**  is here to stay and change our way of living once again. They’re in their infancy, but getting better very rapidly. Big tech companies understand this new AI as a massive part of all our futures. Staking a claim and building a leadership position is as important as dominating the web was in the 90s.

Microsoft announced a new conversational search feature you can start using right now in Bing AND the Edge browser. Google on the other hand just shot themselves in the food with panicking and rushing their Bard thing. 

**Where is apple in all of this?**

Apple has the tools to build its own generative AI with the Neural Engine built into iPhone and Mac chips that is capable of up to 15.8 trillion operations per second, along with Core ML and machine learning APIs. After all, apple spearheaded AI once with Siri....But we haven’t seen any movement jet

***Conclusion:*** Apple has positioned itself as a technology leader for years now. I don't think they are so badly lead, that apple will give that up! Of course, Apple is one of the most secretive companies in tech, especially when it comes to software. Apple could have big teams working hard to bring generative AI features soon. (They bought at least o ne generative AI company: AI Music) I hope we get a surprise at a coming WWDC: World-class generative AI all over Apple’s products! (I really hope that’s the case, because if they are late to the game on such a transformational technology, it’s going to doom its software to being years behind its competitors)

**What do you think?**"
"iPhone users - do you want RCS? If Apple were to adopt RCS would you find it beneficial? Do you text enough friends/family with Androids that it would excite you? 

Genuinely curious if iOS users have any desire for the feature. Clearly Tim Cook doesn’t think so.

Edit 1: Results:

So based on the feedback we have a pretty mixed bag. 

1) Majority of folks are open to it as long as it’s not overseen by Google (none of you use a Gmail already??). Which makes the most sense to me, Apple will always do it the Apple way and would find a way to have full control over it as they always do imo. 

2) lots of you (mainly Europeans) who could care less either way. I envy you, it would be nice if this didn’t even need to be a conversation. Please feel free to convince anyone in NA to download 1-2 messaging apps to accommodate android users… you’ll understand our pain. 

3) smaller portion of the crowd are in the hard no camp. Main reason seems to be Googles involvement or no reasoning given. 

Interesting spread of results. I sit in the camp of why not improve the experience for all users regardless of platform if there is a clear roadmap on how to do it? Not saying RCS in its current form is the final best option, but it’s a foundation that can be built on."

The menu bar Spotlight produces way too many (shitty/far-off) results for it to be useful. I thought Apple improved Spotlight quite recently?

"Apple Names First People Officer, Shifting Role From Retail Head ;"
"Will Siri ever become more intelligent? As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, one question that has been on many people's minds is whether or not Siri will ever become more intelligent. Apple has been quiet about their releases and advancements, but with Microsoft and Google both releasing advanced AI models for search, it begs the question: what could Apple be working on?

There are several probable scenarios in which Apple has a chance to take the lead in the AI race. For one, they have already made significant advancements in on-device processing, which could serve as a foundation for further improvements. They have also announced an AI Summit event later this year. Additionally, Apple has a reputation for keeping their cards close to their chest, so it's possible that they are silently working on something revolutionary.

The competition in the AI space is fierce, with Microsoft and Google both making giant steps forward in recent months. It's not just a battle between these two tech giants, though, and many people are hoping that Apple will soon join the fray. Bing's reawakening and Google Bard's offering coming up to everyone. 

The future of AI is uncertain, but one thing is for sure: the competition is heating up. Whether or not Apple will be able to go to the next level remains to be seen, but the advancements being made by other companies serve as a reminder of the gigantic steps that companies have to take in order to stay ahead of the game. It kind of feels like 10 years ago when we had a new smartphone release every week... we tried all kinds of new UI features, and the iOS vs Android war was full steam, I'm excited to see what's gonna happen!

What do you think? Will Siri ever become more intelligent? How do you see Apple fitting into the AI landscape in the future? Let's have a discussion!"

"Heads up: New iPhone and Watch trade in boxes can cause confusion I just wanted to share here a new issue that I dealt with this year, that I haven’t previously experienced, to hopefully save someone else the trouble.

Previously when I had traded in my iPhone and Watch, I recall the boxes being a bit different. This year I traded in both, and I received two boxes that to me were identical. They both had instructions for the phone and watch, I recall no clear marking to indicate which was which. I’ll tell you why this mattered.

I accepted a trade in of my phone for $550, and $155 for my watch. Apparently, I mixed up the boxes (still not knowing how I could have known the difference). This resulted in my phone being sent as trade in for the watch, and my watch being sent as trade in for the phone.

Now since I had sent a $550 device in place of a trade in for a $155 device, Apple sent me a gift card for the difference. Since I sent in a $155 device in place of a trade in for a $550 device, Apple had to charge me the difference.

So I ended up having to pay extra out of pocket than originally planned, and the only saving grace is that I now have an Apple gift card for the difference. Which isn’t really what I wanted, I wasn’t planning on spending any more money in their store for a few months.

I apologize if this is hard to follow, but the PSA here is this: If you trade in a phone and a watch at the same time, be VERY sure you know which box is for which, because if you get it wrong the whole process is super confusing and you’ll pay more than you intended to."

They’re just all over the place it seems like, between being unsure of what color schemes to stick with (see Mac desktop models in primary pastel colors vs. iPhone/iPad/watch/Macbook colors remaining pretty much neutral/industrial) and the fact that Apple cannot decide on what screen bezel design they want to move towards, where is the consistency?
Like most of the industry at this point, they are trying to move away from notched phones and towards fullscreen-ish designs, but while introducing the dynamic island design to iPhones/just starting to move away from the notch, they’re now implementing the notch in previously-fullscreen Macbook models—all while the iPad has moved to a bezeled fullscreen design. Additionally, Apple is still pushing the square-edged iPhone/iPads while the watch line still retains the pill-shaped bodies of older iPhone models, seen from the iPhone 6 to 11 models.

"Apple Health & Fitness future? Hey everyone,

As someone who recently switched to Apple ecosystem, I am trying to learn more about the products and how to build up my ecosystem with meaningful additions. The way I do it is that I search for the products and examine their current state / features and what is coming. In general I am really satisfied with my MBP and iPhone.

However, as a pervious Garmin Epix2 owner (now AWU), this is where I feel Apple lacks the most and thought it wouldn't be the case. I am not an extreme athlete, I don't need GPS tracking or outdoor stuff trackings - I am dude that goes to gym, doing strength training. So in terms of 'workout' support, I am not that interested in that.

What I find Garmin does way better is the features like: Stress Management, Body Battery, Readiness Score , Morning Report, Step counting, and ..  most interesting to me, Insights. 

At the moment, I have following Apps: Autosleep, HeartWatch and Athlytic (+ Centr for Fitness App). There is no Fitness+ in my country. I did pay for the premium, but I still find it lacklustre, compared to Garmin or even Fitbit (I tested Pixel Watch for a while). 

I do not like the idea of having soo many third party apps, but if they would provide me with data the way I imagine Apple would do (nice UI/UX, straight to the point, no need to be data scientist to understand insights, etc.), I'd be completely fine with that.

So I came here wondering, if any of you have any info on what is Apple's plan in regards to Health & Fitness features? I learned that they have a dedicated executive role for Apple Health, so I would assume they would make big leaps here - but couldn't find any info on roadmaps or future features.

Did I do my research poorly and the apps I chose are simply not the best for this? Then I would be happy to test some you would suggest for me. For me, I don't need lots of raw data, but rather explanation of data and what can I do about it or what does it tell me about me / my pattern.

  
Examples:

\- You had only 10min of deep sleep. It is advisable to have X amount for your age and goals. Try going to sleep at Y time and do \*this\* before going to bed.

\- You did only 100 steps so far. It is recommended to do at least XXXX steps per day. To target that goal  you need need to do 250 steps per hour. Get moving now! (And it would actually track steps, not the 'Stand Time' like Apple Watch does).

\- Your HRV was quite low during the night and your RHR was a bit increased. It seems you did not get enough rest during the night, so track your readiness score throughout the day. If you would like to exercise today, try having a nap in afternoon.

\- etc.

Now it could be AutoSleep  / Athlytic / HeartWatch does say that SOMEWHERE amidst tons of numbers and data, but I would like to have it as an 'Insight' section or a Push notification."
"Hello from /r/Android! Where do you see the industry going? As a Pixel owner, I'm seeing the subreddit on team green grow incredibly stagnant. Personally l use whatever gets the job done, and it feels like that is such a low bar now be it Windows vs Mac or Android vs iOS. Cheap and expensive devices alike are incredibly powerful, versatile, fast and efficient.

On the Android side all anyone seems to care about are foldables, and now each OEM is really trying to make their own ""thing"". Pixel wants AI, computational photography and automation to be its thing, and these are useful, but far from earth shattering. It all just doesn't feel as exciting as it once was, everything is plateauing. I'm so bored looking at benchmarks and tiny little tweaks to numbers.

I'm curious to see where you all think the industry is going? Are phones simply an upgrade every 2-3 years now thing or is the industry going to rock itself again? Has the industry matured and have we reached (or are near) peak smartphone?"

"What do YOU do with your MacBook, and what can you teach me? My M2 Max got delayed so I thought to make this post to help fill my void. I’m looking for a bunch of ideas and suggestions on what I can do with my new computer. For some context, it’s my first Mac. I had a PC like 10 years ago and finally needed to update and since everything else I have is in the ecosystem I went with a MacBook this time. 

I’d love to learn new things such as coding, whether it be in app development or in data science. I have friends that do both and it seems interesting and fun. I have started to get into photography as well, I have a 13 Pro and I love taking photos with it. I do a lot of cooking and frequently write down my recipes and take photos in case I ever want to create content. 

What do you guys use your MacBooks for? What programs do you recommend? Any specific courses for improving my skills or learning new ones? I’m in my mid-late 20’s, don’t even work in my degree, and might be looking to move to a new city, so if I get good at any of this stuff I’ll definitely switch it up haha. 

Thanks for your help everyone!

Edit: To everyone telling me to cancel the order, half the cost of this was covered so I’m paying 2 grand for a 4k machine. I’m not cancelling, I’d rather have an overpowered machine that I can learn to utilize in time rather than one that I’ll need to upgrade again later. I appreciate you guys looking after my wallet all the same."
"I created a Smart Diary that allows you to have your own AI. Called Moolight - Smart Diary [Download Moolight - Smart Diary](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/moodlight-intelligent-note/id1631169735)

Instead of writing a long journal, I love taking short notes throughout the day, in a bullet point format. In this way, I could better record the thoughts that could otherwise be forgotten.

My girlfriend writes diary every day. The problem she had is that after writing for years, there is no good way to see the changes in yourself, even though all texts are there.

We tried very hard to search for an app that could fit our need. But failed. **As a result, we took a lot of time to learn and develop our first take on this idea. Of a smart note app.**

**Moolight** is our answer. It features an on-device AI that could help us organize the piece of ideas into 15 categories. And try to provide some insights and feedbacks from all the notes automatically.

We don't want to sacrifice any privacy, as a result, a decision is made to keep all data to yourself & your own iCloud. After tested out the idea, we found a way to make it even smarter and fit your own record style. As a result, you could train your absolutely unique AI on your device in Moolight.

The more you write and correct the category, the better your own AI gets. In our own test, with the default AI, the accuracy is about 70% correctness. If you write for about 20 days with 5 bullet points per day, and correct the category. Your could own a unique AI that do chores sorting out your notes 100% categories correctness for all your notes.

&#x200B;

**Why bother creating another note app?**

Complex tools makes it's easy to get lost. When using simple tools, the notes could easily scattered everywhere. Why can't software help? We live in an age when technology advances every day, yet the software for notes seem to become unchanged since long time ago.

That's why we spent long time, realizing this idea. And had great fun developing this product. The idea is about writing without being disturbed. Enjoy the ease of use brought by technological advances while having absolute privacy.

&#x200B;

**Design Thoughts**

My girlfriend is a data scientist, and I had background in software and design. We wanna to combine our experiences, and attempt to give this idea our best effort. Since day one, we discussed and settled on the following ground rules:

1. We believe everyone should be the sole owner of our data, especially in a case for note or diary. So data never leaves your device or iCloud. All data should be processed on-device with neural engine. It should be 100% functional when offline.
2. We wanna it to be smart, to make life easier. To do this, it should know how we feel when we write; It should know the realtime weather so my gf don't need to type in manually; It should know I'm writing about food, without specifying the category. It should be able to track anything that we ever want to know if we wrote about it.
3. We wanna it to be able to think. To write a short headline each day and help us recall. It should know the top content I'm constantly writing about, and use my data to give us some feedback. We wanna it know them all, yet do not ask for any information besides what I actually write.

&#x200B;

**Why there are three tabs?**

Today, Gallery and Insights.

The idea is that whenever you want to write something, it's in the Today tab, this is where you focus on the moment. When you want to have a look at the past. All the information is well organized and truthfully present to you in Gallery tab.

We can't predict the future. However, in some way, we could also get a glimpse of idea about future based on what we were doing in the past. This is what Insights tab do.

▶ Today ◀ • Bullet Based Input • Automatic added Weather & Location • Mood Lights to Know Your Feeling • Time Travel to Past and Future • Dynamic Background that Flows.

▶ Gallery ◀ • Refined Card with Mood Color • Daily Auto Headline • Auto Classification for Each Input • Powerful Search by Time and Types.

▶ Insights ◀• Cumulative Days, and Inputs Count • Weekly Glance to be Surprised • Keyword to Know What Mattered • Track Anything as Tags • Know What made you Happy with Mood Trend • Random Show to Recall Memories • Mapped Journey to Mark your Path • Liked/Web Records to Shortcut • Customize Modules on Your Preference.

• iCloud Sync and Backup for iPhone/iPad/Mac • Face ID for Additional Safety • Customize Color, Typography, etc • Recycled Bin for Accidental Delete • Automatic Light and Dark Mode.

&#x200B;

**What can it do?**

**• Intelligent Classification**

Declutter the life events. Work, Food, Study and so on. It just knows.

**• Understand Your Mood**

How’s your day? Moolight will do the best guess.

**• Multiple Organizers**

Event, Emotions, Keywords, Maps, etc. Multiple ways to visualize the data.

&#x200B;

Since it's unlike any existing note or diary product in the market. It takes time to get familiar with Moolight, and once you get familiar with it, hopefully you'll grow the love of it like we did. Moolight is released to the App Store on the first day of 2023. And we're still trying very hard to polish it.

Would love to hear your thoughts about it."

"Have the M series Macs killed the “replace a Mac with the iPad” movement? I know personally, I went from wanting to try and get an iPad Pro 12.9 to use a travel laptop to getting the M1 MacBook Pro as soon as I could. 

Now I don’t particular need/want a large iPad as the MacBooks now have the battery life and speed to match what I wanted. Anyone else think this applies to the whole “iPad as a computer” movement?

I think the only thing Apple is missing is some kind of entry level MacBook like the old style plastic MacBooks from circa ~2008"

"New HomePods vs Original HomePods Has anyone else got a chance to set up their new HomePods in a pair?

I bought 3 today and used 2 of them to replace the pair in my Bedroom. 

The audio quality is unbearably worse than the originals. They have harsh mids that are not present on any other speakers. It’s around 1.5khz -2khz. 

The bass is also very lacking. I am going to have to return these two because the sound isn’t just not as good, it is harsh on the ears. 

Just looking for input from anyone else that is hearing this right now."
Apple sales in biggest fall since 2019 ;
"PSA: Don’t let Apple deny your request to update Date of Purchase for a brand new previous-gen product. Had to escalate to manager level to get them to do it. Just got off the phone with Apple in what was an super frustrating experience from a company that brags about its consumer-friendly policy. 

I just bought a Series 6 from an online retailer just last week and set it up today. After set up, I noticed that it said “Coverage Expired”. Weird but no biggie, I’ll just call Apple and it’ll be sorted out soon. Or so I thought. 

First CSR asked me to provide proof of payment which I gladly did. I even screenshared my phone to show the receipt in my email. He asked me to upload my screenshots. No problemo. He then transfers me to another CSR.

I’m 20 minutes into what I thought would be 5 mins. The second CSR informs me that due to the fact that it’s a Series 6 they can’t update the Date of Purchase. Excuse me? I bought it brand new from a reputable retailer (Sportchek). It wasn’t open box or anything. The box was sealed. The CSR gives me this gem: because the AW was shipped to the retailer in 2020, they cannot update the Date of Purchase. 

This was shocking to hear. I told her that it doesn’t matter to me as the end consumer when a product was shipped to the retailer. I bought it new and they have to honour the manufacturer’s warranty. She transfers me to her manager. 

I’m now 45 minutes into this call. Manager gets on the phone and asks me what the issue was. I explained how I’m being told that Apple does not cover its own new products just because of when they were shipped to a retailer. She apologizes and agrees with me and goes ahead and approves the update to the Date of Purchase. Finally!! 

Took me almost an hour on the phone to get done what should have never been an issue in the first place. So DO NOT let Apple reject your request to update the Date of Purchase if you bought a NEW Apple product. Consumer laws exist to protect the end users from this sort of bs."

"Discussion: The friction between using an iPhone and Windows Computer I have an iPhone. I also have a Windows PC at home and use a Windows PC at work. I use the Windows PC at work because I must, and I use the Windows PC at home because it’s a requirement for my online Business Administration Degree. Additionally, I've always liked Windows because it's what I'm used to. 

Most of my personal life is on my iPhone. The native calendar, reminder, and notes app all seamlessly connect to help me manage my life and be productive. I have notes integrated with the reminders app and reminders set out way into the future. This runs my life.

I’m really loving using Windows more and more every day. Whether it’s for school, work, or for personal use. The programs I’ve used are so feature rich. They’re a pleasure to use and find out all the possible capabilities that can help me be productive. Lately, I’ve been learning more and more about Excel and OneNote. It’s honestly been fun and I’m enjoying myself quite a bit.

This leads me to a point of friction. I love using Windows App’s on my PC, but my whole life is wrapped up on an iPhone which I also enjoy. The webpages for iPhone apps are quite garbage (looking at you Apple Notes). I’m considering making the switch from Apple to Windows and migrating all my notes and reminders to Windows apps. 

My question is this: Is it worth it? For those with an iPhone and Windows PC, which apps do you use to manage your personal life? Are you frustrated with the limitations? More generally, what is your workflow?"

Recently I was using the Air 2 again, and realised it had such a better battery life vs the Pro. Despite being several years older (battery deterioration), it has crazy good standby time and lasts longer whole browsing or watching videos. Have Apple optimised their newer iPads for more power vs battery life? 

I have to say I feel like I need to charge my iPad Pro quite often. While only browsing and consuming media."

"I’m in love with my M2 Max I’m a software dev doing mobile development and web development. My previous machine was a 2019 MBP with i9 and 32GB RAM - so quite powerful IMO. 

I just made the switch to Apple silicon with an M2 Max MBP and holy moly am I not disappointed! On the contrary. I can do Android builds, iOS builds, typescript builds, you name it, and this freaking machine doesn’t even get warm!

I also use a high resolution ultra wide screen and that alone was heating up my previous MBP due to the strain on the GPU.

Before, even video calls would have the fans blow like crazy. Now I have yet to find a task that makes the M2 sweat even a little bit.

"If you travel often using public transit you might find Glarm useful. It’s an app that notifies you whenever you’re closing in on your destination and it’s been recently updated for iOS 16! [Glarm is available for free in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/glarm-location-based-alarms/id1523237367)

If you’re like me and you travel a lot by train, or bus you might not always recognize railway stations or tell quickly how far is your stop, so you start nervously checking the time and position on the map.

With Glarm you can set alarm to ring, let’s say 5 kilometres from your destination and in the meantime, take a nap, or watch a movie without worrying about missing the stop.

**It was recently updated with support for Live Activities on iOS 16** so now you can track the distance from the destination on your lock screen.

Let me know what you think about it and have a wonderful Sunday!"
"I've just released Pestle 1.4 with Smart Folders, PDF Import, Image Import and more! Hey r/Apple! 

I'm Will, a 20-year-old developer from Adelaide, Australia. I build [Pestle, an intelligent recipe manager for iPhone & iPad](https://apple.co/3sWeyWl) (The Mac version is coming along well, and it will be worth the wait!).

If you're not already familiar with Pestle, [checkout the launch post from 6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/sgctww/ive_just_released_pestle_transform_any_recipe/). But in short, Pestle is a Recipe Organiser that lets you save recipes from any website.

# Smart Folders

This is one is really cool! Pestle now has 'Smart Folders', which fill themselves up based on the criteria you set. Want to filter your 400 recipes down to just 4-star or higher desserts that aren't alcoholic beverages? Easy! As you save new recipes to Pestle, they'll automatically be added to your Smart Folders.

# PDF Import

This one is for those of you with Cookbooks as PDFs. Pestle can now show you your PDF Cookbook and will guide you through adding your favourites to Pestle. Once saved, Pestle will use its smarts to enable you to scale recipes, convert them, and more. 

# Image Import

Much like PDF Importing, Pestle can now handle photos you've taken of recipe cards and the like, with Live Text on iOS 16, scanning photos into Pestle is a breeze.

### Search Improvements

This is a smaller one, but worth a mention. Sometimes when searching across your large collection, exactly _why_ a recipe shows up might not be clear. You may search for ""Italian"", and a recipe with ""Italian Herbs"" will show up. Now search results will show in the top right exactly _why_ they're there, like ""Matches Ingredient"" or ""Main Course"".

# Privacy First

Frankly, it's none of my business what you cook with Pestle, where you share it to, etc etc. That's why the [Privacy Policy](https://pestlechef.app/privacy) is so short, there's very little for me to say. First and foremost, **Pestle does not collection identifiable information** (with the only exception of your email, if you even consider that identifiable, and also only **if you use email signup**, if you use Sign In with Apple/Google, then this doesn’t apply. For analytical purposes, I do track daily active users, version breakdowns and such. **But none of this information is tracked back to you, it is 100% anonymous**. I use [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com), a privacy-focused platform use by many other popular apps, such as Apollo for Reddit.


That sums up this update, it's my biggest update since releasing Live Activities (among other things), so I hope you like it :)

I would love for you to give it a try, so go get [Pestle on the App Store](https://apple.co/3sWeyWl)!"
"I just released Oolong v2, a ""future forward"" budget app that can help you control the ""shape"" of your money! Hey /r/apple, 

Just launched Oolong *v2* after two years of doing other... stuff 🙈

#### [GET IT HERE](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1549289924)

---

**TL;DR:** 

Oolong is a ""future forward"" budget app that helps users control the ""shape"" of their money. Whereas other apps like Mint, YNAB, and [Envy](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/q5dd4a/i_created_a_budgeting_app_that_doesnt_collect_any/) are great at helping users understand ""what happened"", Oolong is all about predicting ""what *will* happen"" so that you can make smarter financial decisions **today**.

---

**What's New?**

Oolong is the reason I picked up iOS development 3 years ago. The [original app](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/) was, admittedly pretty basic, but it got the job done! This latest version is everything that I've learned a lot about building enterprise apps over these last couple years along with: 

- Completely new design (as requested by [/u/Darpyface](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glj008n/))
- Balance Sheets and Income Statements
- Multiple Accounts (as requested by [/u/John-McAfee](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glicfor/))
- Decimals! (as requested by [/u/lizadting](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/gli07qb/))

---

**Use cases**

I've been using the Oolong methodology for over a decade (then just an Excel spreadsheet). It's the singular tool that I use to manage my money. Hearing from several v1 users, many have used Oolong to: 

- Figure out how much to allocate to savings/investments
- Plan major one-time purchases
- Figure out ""how much apartment"" to rent/buy

---

**Freemium**

Oolong is free for the first 3 accounts (assets/liabilities) and 7 plan items (incomes/transfers/expenses). An ""In App Upgrade"" can be purchased to unlock unlimited accounts and plan items, as well as remove ads.

I really think that Oolong can help users escape the ""paycheck-to-paycheck"" trap. So, if you use and love Oolong, but can't afford the upgrade right now, please send me a quick email at oolong@bracket.ltd with a little explanation about how you hope to use Oolong to improve finances and I'll endeavour to send you a code!

"Is this the Mandela effect, or did Apple announce wireless Bluetooth or NCF tags for retailers around 2015?  I've tried looking into this for a little while and I can find no trace of it on the internet.

I swear I have a memory from probably around 2015 of a WWDC video where Tim Cook was advertising NFC/Bluetooth/similar devices to brick and mortar retailers. I cant remember what their value proposition was, but it provided some digital services to customers.  Maybe you download apps, order online, or similar - basically a glorified QR code. Sorry, my memory is very patchy.

Outside of the mention at the WWDC, I have no other memory of it (never saw it on their website, in person, etc). That, plus me being unable to figure out an actual use case for this product, plus not being able to find anything about it on the internet is making me thinking I've just made this up!

Does anyone else remember anything like this, or have I lost the plot!?

(PS - to confirm, I'm not referring to AirTags)"

"What is the purpose of making a service appointment? A week ago I made an appointment to get my battery changed. The price is being hiked in March, and my phone is a few years old still on the original battery. May as well change it before the price hike as it is noticeably weaker. (On my 6s I'd change the battery myself, but honestly I cba to replace iphone batteries myself now). 

So I made an appointment online, where I input that I was coming in for a battery replacement, the day I wanted, the store I would be at, and the type of phone I have. I even got the email & text reminder about my appointment this morning, so I drive to the Apple store, get checked in, wait for a staff member to be available, start the initial info gathering part of the process.......just to be told the store doesnt have my battery in stock, and they would have to order it and wait 3-5 business days.

What was the point of the appointment?!? They knew when I was coming in, they knew what store I was going to, they knew what type of battery I needed. Seriously, instead of a reminder email & text why couldn't I have gotten a message saying we don't have the battery yet, don't bother coming in. Why is the battery only being ordered now...AFTER I came in, not when I booked the appointment (Ya know, more than 3-5 business days ago).

The ""most innovative tech company"" can't even link their appointment schedule with the Apple stores? Not even like I was at a third party repair center, it was an official Apple store...

"Never ever ever get AppleCare through Best Buy Total Tech AppleCare + Best Buy=weeks of waiting

Do NOT get Best Buy Total Tech for your iPhone or, probably any apple product. These two companies need to acknowledge that the relationship isn’t working and it is at the customer’s expense. Honestly, Best Buy, he or she is not that into you, move on. And customers- neither is interested in you, you’re just in a custody battle.

On 1/3 I brought my beyond repairable iPhone into Best Buy for repair. I have Total Tech with Apple Care so it was fully covered. That all sounds good but what happens after is the most maddening b.s. 

1) The person I talked to at the Geeksquad counter looked at my phone, could see it is well beyond repair and said they could not take the phone in because I would need to make a Geeksquad appointment because they need to “run diagnostics to see if it is covered by Total Tech AppleCare”. It is. Is this something I can look up online on my account myself? He says, “Yes, you can do that.” This makes no sense then why an appointment is needed to determine that because if I can look it up (and I already had), why can’t the Geek Squad dude standing in Best Buy who has my account pulled up in his Best Buy computer not find this information himself? But I don’t want to make his life difficult because whatever they have going on for an inefficient system isn’t his fault. I ask if I can get in for that appointment that day or evening. No. It will be 3 days. Wait three days for them to look up my Apple Care. WTF. Ok, corporate bullshit has me waiting a few days.

2) 3 days later I make the time to drive back over there again with the same issue-need the phone replaced. The person at the counter this time is more helpful to the degree they can be. She is like, “I don’t know why they made you wait and make an appointment we can just do this right here.” She says she worked in the phone section but that they don’t cross train which leads to that stuff—As in being required to make an appointment to verify AppleCare coverage. And my Geeks Squad appointment says customer want to verify Apple Care coverage as my reason for the appointment. Um. NO, I DON’T, I want to move the repairs forward. I let her know that I appreciated her help and thought it seemed excessive to have to go in twice, 3 days apart just for that. She processed the phone, could see it is unrepairable and charged me for a replacement. She says it may be up to THREE WEEKS for them to replace. The phone but it does get overnight shipped both ways. Ok. So I have to use an old phone that does not get texts from almost numbers, that does not get data because my SIM is 5G and the phone is 4g. But, it’s temporary, it’ll be fine. It is, however, my work phone so I have to tell everybody that I do not get texts nor do I have data.

3) Days pass. Weeks pass. I go to AppleCare to find out what is going on. There is no record of a repair for my phone with them because they run it all through Best Buy and cut the customer out. You cannot talk to ANYONE at Apple because they have no record of your repairin their system. This leaves tracking a repair through Best Buy. When that happens it simply says, “We are moving forward with your repair’ or some unhelpful sentence like. No timeline, no deadline, no contact info. 

4) I am now 25 days in from the start of this. I decide to call the store to speak to a human. Instead it’s AI that tells me the phone attached to my number is currently in repair. OMG I KNOW THIS.  I say I want to talk to a person and AI tells me it “understands” I want to talk to someone and the wait will be 7 minutes. 5 minutes in someone answers. BUT it is clear I have been forwarded to a call center.  I explain what I want to know, they tell me they will see what is going on.  Hold. They return to tell me that my phone is being repaired.  That is so inadequate. I KNOW THIS. I want more accountability on that end- what is going on, give me a date, etc. He tells me I should call the store and would I like the number.. No- because that is where I called and got sent out to them.  

5) Today I go in to Best Buy again. They apologize and say they are unable to talk to any human being there and are only able to escalate the order and they say they have been doing it every other day and, will now, on day 24, start doing it daily. And they tell me this is typical of Apple with them.

DO NOT GET TOTALTECH for your Apple device. Pretty sure Apple deprioritizes their Best Buy work, Best Buy gets your Total Tech money so they don’t care as it is still profitable for them and you are out your device for weeks on end, with zero accountability on either company’s end. Absolute bs."

"Universal control appreciation post So this is an upvote for universal control and a downvote for M2 MBA only supporting 1 external display. 

I have a personal M2 MBA and a M1 MBP that is my work machine.

Two things to know about me: 

1. I have been wanting 3 screens. Was really frustrated about the M2 MBA not supporting 2 externals. 
2. I have been trying to keep work / personal stuff separate 

Now I have a set up where the two laptops are mounted on either side of my monitor. I have 3 screens!! I also can control both personal and work with one set of mouse/keyboard which is great. 

Of course I still can't share windows across the machines, but I haven't found that to be much of an issue. I usually keep slack/spotify on one screen and do my work on the other two. 

I was pretty skeptical about universal control but I'm actually a pretty big fan of it. It works so much better than I thought it would."
"Security keys, 2FA, account recovery testing I did some testing with and without security keys…

**Scenario**: 2FA enabled, Advanced Data Protection Enabled, Recovery Key set, 2 Recovery Contacts set  
   
Apple ID password reset - there are 3 options:  
1.	 You must HAVE unlocked trusted device AND must KNOW device passcode and then you can change password in settings (can be secured more by blocking Account changes with different pin) 
  

2.	You must KNOW a trusted phone number AND must HAVE unlocked trusted device to get pushed 6 digit code to reset remotely


3.	You must KNOW a trusted phone number AND must HAVE it to receive SMS verification code/call AND must KNOW your icloud recovery key
 

Logging in - there are two options:  
1.	Must KNOW password ; must HAVE unlocked trusted device
2.	Must KNOW password ; must HAVE working trusted phone number for SMS/Call
               


!!! Note I couldn't see a way to use Recovery Contacts.  Apple says having a Recovery Key set means Account Recovery is disabled, originally I thought this would just disable the manual Account Recovery that happens when you phone apple up about it - but it doesn't make it clear this means Recovery Contacts don't work. [edit] However the Recovery Key or Recovery Contacts are still very likely important for recovering end to end encryption keys for iCloud. 


___

 
**New scenario**: As above but with 2 Security Keys set as well  
 
  
Apple ID password reset - there is maybe 1 actual option:  
  
1.	You must HAVE an unlocked trusted device AND must KNOW device passcode to use settings menu to change password

2.	iforgot.apple.com - pushes a notification to your trusted devices which takes you to do #1 above...  or you can alternatively get instructions for #3. It does not apply 6 digit code etc. 

3.	Tells you to use Apple Support app etc.  When I try this currently it asks to confirm my phone number, and then takes me to a ""Security Key Verification - To reset your password, verify one of your security keys."" screen.  But this is immediately popped over with a ""Cannot verify identity - Your action could not be completed because of a server error. Try again."" message before I even have time to try to scan a key.  Maybe its suspicious because of all the fooling around I've been doing. This is where IMO it should allow you to HAVE the security key and KNOW the recovery key. 

4.	With the SAME factors as #1 you can also remove all the security keys from your account and remove the restrictions in place but this isn't really a separate option as its the same factors…
  
!!! So in this configuration, if correct, your account is GONE if a) you can't unlock a trusted device AND b) you forgot your icloud password. As above I don't feel this is correct - you should be able to HAVE a Security Key + KNOW the Recovery Key.  That said, this scenerio should be very rare?  And anybody who loses all their devices and forgets their icloud password is pretty unlikely to know their recovery key :P
  
!!!Your account is NOT lost if you lose all your security keys - see #4 above you can just delete them if you have the factors for #1  

The Recovery Key or Recovery contacts can’t seem to help you reset the password in this scenario, however they are still important to recover end to end encryption keys for iCloud data. 

  
Logging in there is only one option:  
                Must KNOW password ; must HAVE one of your security keys (or see #4 above)  
                (that said, I only tested this on icloud.com, didn't try logging in to a new device because pain but I suspect its the same...)
 
  
Google will let you have security keys plus other forms of two factor. However if you turn Google advanced protection on, then it also reverts to only allowing security keys as the second factor. But you can set a recovery contact that they warn will take several days to process."

"Sharpness of iMac 24"" vs Macbook Pro We got a 24"" iMac at work and I'm just amazed by the clarity of its screen? I thought it was the same PPI as the 13"" MBP  and Apple even says it's only 218PPI vs the 227 of the MacBook. Even so, when I'm comparing the iMac screen to my (2017) MBP it's definitely sharper. The difference is slight of course but I'm still wondering how it can be. Did Apple change the panels for True Tone and they appear sharper through more contrast?"

"Anyone Else Very Disappointed with Freeform? I was so incredibly excited for Freeform to launch because I love collaborating on projects with people for all types of things. It felt clunky to always be using different apps for different things, and I thought Freeform would be a great combination of other Apple apps (with functionality from Notes, Keynote, Numbers, etc.). 

BUT after spending this week tying to collaborate with my partner on a house we're building (layouts, floor plan, dimensions, lists, etc.) in Freeform, I find myself disappointed over how much is lacking. 

I'm hoping Apple adds a lot more power and functionality in the future. 

Primarily, I would love 

* the ability to change the dimensions of shapes (like one can do in Numbers, Keynote, Pages)
* change background color, grid, grid type, etc. 
* hold down hand-drawn lines / shapes and have them snap into the shape 
* snap hand drawn lines or shapes to the grid 
* be able to select more than just hand drawn lines 
* be able to select / move / scale / rotate / duplicate groups of objects 
* be able to lock objects 
* have an object tree sidebar 
* have settings or preferences 

Curious what thoughts you all have!"
M2 Max proves stunningly fast in text recognition benchmark test ;
"Is Apple mixing and matching NAND flash configurations in M2 Pro Mac Minis? So I have just watched four separate YouTube videos all reporting the same capacity with totally different SSD speeds . Two with a 1TB and 2 with a 512GB M2 Pro Mac Mini. The channels are Dave2D, Luke Miani, iPhoneDo and Mcstudio FPV. The SSD speeds from each channel have get these speeds: 

[512GB getting 3172.8 MB/s read, 2973 MB/s write](https://youtu.be/vbmb_Z8QdxU?t=561) 

[512GB SSD getting 4707MB/s read, 2867MB/s write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d3s4xpQ830)

[1TB getting 5854.4 MB/s read and 6202 MB/s write](https://youtu.be/1y7NJXZ-5kU?t=226) 

The two explanations are the YouTube channels have mistyped the capacity of their drives, or mixed up their results, or Apple is mixing and matching SSD configurations. Sometimes using 128GB flash, sometimes using 256GB flash, sometimes using 512GB flash. Can anyone verify or shed some insight on this?"

The iPad mini 6 jelly scrolls when in portrait orientation [due](https://www.notebookcheck.net/iFixit-explains-why-the-iPad-mini-6-suffers-from-jelly-scrolling.568461.0.html) to its display’s vertically mounted controller board, whereas displays with horizontally mounted controller boards like the iPad mini 5 or iPad Air would only jelly scroll when in landscape mode.

The iPad Pro also has a vertically mounted controller board but at 120hz it’s unnoticeable. 

So it would stand to reason that the Studio Display at 60hz, when rotated 90° would jelly scroll.

"People in the Apple ecosystem who got rid of their Apple Watch, why? e.g. you have an iphone, ipad  and MacBook but just don't get along with the watch

 \- you switched to another type of smart watch, if so how is it better for your circumstances?

 \- you realised you didn't need one or found it too annoying, what specifically: charging hassle, it broke too easily, didn't do what you'd hoped, another 'thing' to have to manage etc

&#x200B;

I am considering getting one, but unlike a phone/laptop/computer that I've used for decades, this is an entirely new type of device, so I am interested to know why people felt it fell short enough to ditch it entirely.

For people who still have an Apple Watch and love it, great! But this is not the thread for you to comment on :D


**EDIT**: thanks everyone for all your very detailed reponses and discussions, super informative I will read them all and then decide!

**EDIT 2**: the single biggest issue for most people seems to be the battery life, so for that reason, for now, I'm out. Once they get the battery-life up to a week, then I will reconsider. Regarding the 'distractions' it's really hard to gauge as I know you can configure it and for every person who says 'it's a nightmare' another says 'game changer' as they don't have to use their phone as often. Other reasons include longevity, as other people say, for the same money you can get a watch, though functionally poorer, will last decades."
"Spouses sharing iCloud accounts Hello there reddappleiverse… My wife and I have been using the same iCloud account (my email) on all our Apple devices since 2009 mainly because that was the only way to share purchases (before family support) and share a single iCloud photo library (before iCloud Shared Photo Library). We keep our messages/FaceTime separate just by unchecking the other phone number unchecked in settings and never giving out the Apple ID email as a way to be messaged/called. We like that we can use “find my” to ding either of our devices which I do for her a few times a week. However, it has some annoyances like bugs where it shows missed calls to the other number, and messaging business chat shows up on both devices. Other than that, it generally works fine and we are used to it, but I have 2 questions for the hive mind:
1.	Does anyone else still do this? Are there some other benefits I might not be realizing?
2.	Splitting them seems like a good idea but a huge pain. Can someone talk me out of this? Anyone successfully completed a split like this?"

"Touch up scratches on Apple Watch Is there a good solution to touch up minor scratches on the Apple Watch? 

My watch has been working well for 2 years and the recent update has even made the battery life better. Theres no point in recycling it since I won’t get any money for a perfectly working watch.

So is there a way to touch up scratches on the watch? So far I haven’t had any luck finding a paint product that can do that. Even my car touch up pain which was a bit darker rubbed off after I try to cover the scratches.

Any suggestions on how to cover up the scratches?"

I've babied it ever since I've owned it and it's in immaculate, pristine condition. I've even kept the original box and documentation. 

I put it up for auction on eBay... and the best price I could get was $750. I was also disgusted by such low ball offers I'm getting on this laptop, both on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist.

$750? What the hell? I thought Apple laptops had amazing resale value? This laptop has no dents or scratches whatsoever. I think it's worth at least $1,300. 

Is there something going on here...?"

"AirPods Max orders delayed 2-3 weeks, will Apple release new colors? ;"
"Heads up RE: Apple Studio Display I just bought two Apple Studio displays. I ordered them with a Mac Studio Max and an M2 Air but the computers will arrive in a few weeks and the Studio Displays are here now. I am currently using an iMac 27"" from 2017. My iMac is connected to an OWC Thunderbay4 which holds four 6TB drives. That is chained to another Thunderbay4 with 4 backup  drives. The second Thunderbay is chained to an OWC dock to which I have two fast NVME ssd's for video editing. I connected my new Apple Studio Display to the iMac's second Thunderbolt port and booted it. It was a no go for the display. Studio Displays must be connected directly to the Mac and they have only one Tbolt port (and four USB-C Gen 2 ports).  It can't be chained. Previously my iMac had a different display connected to my OWC dock but the Apple display can't do that, nor could it boot if my other port on the imac was so heavily used. It turns out (an hour and a half with Apple techs that have sent the issue to the engineers) that - apparently - the Apple Display is power intensive (in spite of it's own power cord) and can't deal with the iMac's Thunderbolt setup. The iMac shares a single controller between the two Tbolt ports. I have learned if I boot my iMac with  the display connected to one thunderbolt on my iMac and then add just one Thunderbay and after that add the other Thunderbay with the attached dock, then it's all good and stable but the display will not turn on if I boot with everything attached.  My 16"" M1 Macbook Pro Max will deal with all of this attached at the same time so I am assuming the Mac Studio Max will also since the 4 Tbolts on the Studio  are independent.    Thought I'd clue folks in so since I mistakenly assumed my Studio displays could be easily connected like my previous Eizo display was. BTW...the complaints about the Studio Display's web cam were warranted. I'll be buying a decent web cam. Just horrible. Worse than my old iMac."
"iOS 16.3 questions Hey everyone,

Is 16.2 the latest update on HomePod Mini? My HomePod Mini is on 16.2, and I can’t see any new updates on it. 
I heard that they would enable the humidity and temperature sensors in this update. Should I force update via my Mac?

There doesn’t seem to be an obvious way to report these as far as I can see?

With whom does the liability for in-app ads fall? Apple or the developer? Just curious thank you for reading."

"What's connected to your Mac? I've outgrown my iMac due to 4K video. I'm going to consolidate some smaller SSD/NVMEs into other  enclosures to cut down on all the connected drives I have.  As I was struggling to decide what to toss out (any 512GB SSD) and how to organize my external drives I just had to shake my head when I looked at my setup. My main external is an OWC 4 bay with each bay holding 6TB drives and that is backed up to another OWC 4 bay. Some of the drives are partitioned which is why my list of drives looks so insane.

"Apple should have an all Mac event To me it would seem obvious for Apple to have two stacked events a year (or every other year for Macs) with a 1st quarter event for all things Mac (Mac mini, Mac Studio, Mac Pro, iMac, MacBook, Air, Pro, and accessories like displays and other peripherals) and the 3rd quarter event for obviously everything else (iPhone, iPad, Watch, Airpods, TV, HomePod, etc.). I know there's probably a reason why they don't do that but I also find it odd whenever they release a product in a press release and not in one of there events. Or whenever certain products, like iPads, can either be released in either the first half or second half of the year instead of sticking to a specific release window.

Obviously this is just a quick rant and personal opinion but I'd like to know what everyone else thinks and if anyone knows why Apple doesn't do this."

"How often do you upgrade your apple devices? I acquired almost all apple devices in the ecosystem because I sold my MacBook air 2019 for a custom PC, and now I have the AirPods pro 2, Apple watch series 8, iPhone 11, and iPad 8th gen. I was wondering how often you would upgrade each of your devices. since the AirPods and Apple Watch are still new to me I plan to use them until their lifespan or if they ever if it break down. I still have my 11 which I got as a hand-me-down in 2020 but I don't feel like upgrading right away since it's still good at 85% battery health. as for the iPad I would probably wait till the A12 slow down or if I have to wait for a large upgrade for it. I asked this question mainly because I see people really upgrading their iPhones every year or 2 years from a phone plan but I was wondering I often they upgrade their other apple devices considering if they're part of the ecosystem as well."

"I wanted to use OpenAI's Whisper speech-to-text on my Mac without installing stuff in the Terminal so I made MacWhisper, a free Mac app to transcribe audio and video files for easy transcription and subtitle generation. Would love to hear some feedback on it! When OpenAI released Whisper last year ([https://openai.com/blog/whisper/](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/)) I was blown away by how good it was at speech to text. Rap songs, low quality recordings, multi language conversations, everything seemed to work really well! Unfortunately the setup process required you to install a bunch of dependencies to then have to use Terminal for transcribing audio. Last week I made a very easy to use Mac app to solve this, MacWhisper!

Quickly and easily transcribe audio files into text with OpenAI's state-of-the-art transcription technology Whisper. Whether you're recording a meeting, lecture, or other important audio, MacWhisper quickly and accurately transcribes your audio files into text.

**Features**

* Easily record and transcribe audio files
* Just drag and drop audio files to get a transcription
* Get accurate text transcriptions in seconds (\~15x realtime)
* Search the entire transcript and highlight words
* Supports multiple languages (fastest model is English only)
* Copy the entire transcript or individual sections
* Supports Tiny (English only), Base and Large models
* Reader Mode
* Edit and delete segments from the transcript
* Select transcription language (or use auto detect)
* Supported formats: mp3, wav, m4a and mp4 videos.
* .srt & .vtt export

**Which version do you need?**

You can download MacWhisper or MacWhisper Pro. MacWhisper Pro includes the Large model which offers the best transcription available right now and has industry leading accuracy but takes a lot longer to generate. The regular version of MacWhisper uses the Tiny (English only) and Base models, which are still very accurate and fast. Depending on your usecase you might want to use the Pro version. You can always change what version you want later.

Gumroad has a 250MB file size limit for apps that are listed for free so I had to make that part paid. Select **MacWhisper Pro** from the sidebar and pay 6 or more to get it.

"A lesson learned. Avoid buying any secondhand Airpods. To start, I will say I'm very tech savvy. Today I went to buy some Airpods pro gen 2 that i found listed on offer up BNIB. I stressed to the seller that I wanted to verify the authenticity before I handed over the money. Trust me when I say, these are the best fakes I have ever seen. I checked the serial number on the apple coverage website and it was all green. I connected them to my phone and all the settings that should pop up were there. Every single serial number matched; the box, the case, the individual airpods, and even in the settings app. They even had applecare+ until 2025. These things had me fooled for a solid 4 hours, until I turned on transparency mode. I could tell something was off. I went to the apple store and 3 techs were stumped with the authenticity since it even registered on their diagnostics tools and showed a valid SN. The main tell was the font was ever so slightly off on the inside of the lid and the weight of the counterfeit pods were slightly lighter than authentic. Moral of the story, do not buy airpods on third party marketplaces unless the seller is willing you meet you at apple and let a tech or two take a look at them.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Fake Airpods are getting almost indistinguishable from the real thing. If buying secondhand or from a third party marketplace, do not trust anyone not willing to meet you at an apple store.


EDIT: I remember why I unsubscribed from this god awful high and mighty sub. Acting like y’all never made a mistake, awful people. I can also guarantee I’m more tech literate than any of you negative commenters. I 3d modeled and constructed a dual pc system inside a custom built desk. I’ve built my own 3d printer. I install all my own tech, including a wireless CarPlay unit. I’ve wired and built my own digital soldering iron. I run my own home media plex server that also doubles as a ubiquiti home security server. Fuck all y’all “I guess the bar for tech savvy is low these days”

EDIT 2: BNIB literally means brand new in box. I opened them in front of the seller. They were not used in the slightest"

"World wide returns does not seem to exist Bought an Apple Watch ultra abroad (USA) asked if it would work at home (EU) was told it would work and worst case my right to return was world wide. Came home, setup the watch, realised cellular was not working. Went to my local Apple Store to figure it out, they told me US sold watched some not work in Europe and I could not return an item bought in a different currency.

It makes sense but it’s still frustrating, part of why so buy so much from the Apple Store is the great customer experience, you trust that they will give you accurate information."

Do you think Apple will bother to update the Magic Mouse a third time, or do you think they don’t care to? It would be nice to be able to change the mouse and use it at the same time, and to be able to use any usb-c cable laying around…"
"Netflix is missing quite a few features on Apple TV Title, I'm sure I can't be the only one who's noticed this.

Not only are we stuck with the old landscape tile design, but we're missing:

\- Notifications (including the ability to see what is coming soon)

\- Collections

\- Top 10 trending

\- No way to remove from Continue Watching

\- A way to remote control? This is possible across every other TV device I use and isn't limited to Google Cast, as Xbox & Playstation both show in the ""Casting"" menu (Likely using Netflix Remote Control)

&#x200B;

I understand these may be minor features, but the fact that even the UI looks super dated compared to the other platforms just raises so many questions for me. You're paying the same price as everyone else, and being punished for choosing to use the service on the Apple TV.

The app was last updated on January 11, 2023 so it's not like it isn't being maintained. They're deliberately holding features back from Apple TV users. How is this okay?"

"Dropbox forcing ""Files On-Demand"" cloud storage instead of local storage I use Dropbox to sync my files between a few devices. Notably, I want all of the files to remain on all of the devices.

This weekend, I was presented with a message from my Dropbox client that it wants to move all of my locally stored files from ~/Dropbox to ~/Library/CloudStorage. This is a huge pain in the ass, as it will require updating about a hundred configuration files to point to the new path.

Much more disturbing, the new Dropbox client indicates that all files will be marked as ""On-Demand,"" *i.e.*, potentially not living on my devices but only in Dropbox. This is alarming, since many of my workflows expect files to be available locally and to be immediately available, rather than waiting to be downloaded from Dropbox. It also raises the ugly prospect of discovering that needed files are inaccessible when I'm offline, and being unable to access them (or, at least, without a lengthy delay).

Some research revealed [this article from Microsoft last year](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-disk-space-with-onedrive-files-on-demand-for-mac-529f6d53-e572-4922-a585-e7a318c135f0#:~:text=OneDrive%20Files%20On%2DDemand%20helps,new%20information%20about%20each%20file.) regarding similar changes in OneDrive, and, further, that these changes appear to have been prompted by Apple deprecating some kexts that OneDrive had used for syncing cloud storage files. I also found [this MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/01/onedrive-mac-users-unhappy-files-on-demand/) suggesting that OneDrive users hate this change and find it to be buggy.

I'm extremely irritated by this change, as **I never have and never will rely on on-demand cloud storage for these files**. These files are core to my daily digital life and I expect them to be available all the time on every device and kept fully in sync. I have plenty of local storage space for these files and I am accustomed to managing all of it. So these changes, which not only break current workflows but might introduce new and persistent headaches, are motivated by features that aren't even relevant to me.

I am so deeply irritated by this bullshit that I am now looking at other cloud storage providers that won't engage in this kind of behavior. If I have to blow an entire weekend reconfiguring my machines due to the ghoulish demands of Dropbox, I may as well switch to a provider that is actually sensitive to users' needs.

Recommendations are welcome."

Dear Apple: don't forget the iMac again pls [Luke Miani] ;
In Memory of Tweetbot ;
"All Apple needs to do is make the iPad Pro into a MacOS closed system and voila. All Apple needs to do is make the iPad Pro into a MacOS closed system and voila. And keep their MacBooks as open.

People who want to multitask like a pro on a touch device will actually be tempted by the openness of the MacBook and might get one. And MacBook users might be tempted by the portability of the ipad and get one, even tho they might not get the full experience, most wouldn’t “replace” one with the other.

edit: I'm by no means speaking in favor of the community first. I'm speaking in favor of the, unfortinately, evil corporation that needs to please shareholders and sell tons of devices first, then to the community. And as shitty as it sounds, I think it's actually a great deal that we could get an improved iPadOS UX and UI, along with some tweaks, and let us run most of mac app store apps, just like macos runs iPad apps. That would be enough for me to save for an iPad Pro."

"What’s the difference between Apple Notes and Apple Quick Notes? What’s the difference between Apple Notes and Apple Quick Notes?

I understand that Quick Notes are stored in Notes but why not just send to Notes vs send to Quick Notes.

Even when it comes to the Control Center Controls, there is a Notes control and a Quick Notes control. 

Can’t find the answer anywhere. Searching just compares Apple Notes to OneNote and other completing applications."
"User Feedback Why doesn’t Apple take user feedback seriously? 

Let’s take Siri for example. People have been sharing their experiences and feedback for years yet the product is generally not much better than it was on release. Sure it received a more fluid voice. But as far as its functionality it’s highly inaccurate. 

Having to tell Siri to go away every time it’s used is simply unintuitive. The phrases it uses are immature at best. For example it will say “Uhh hu?” if you don’t speak fast enough. What in the California!?

Siri is has become the substandard of Virtual Assistants. Even pop culture continually rags on it.

Apple seems to care so little that it’s not even listed on the Product Feedback page.
https://www.apple.com/feedback/

Are they afraid of criticism? Do they just not like their user base? Or are they simply smug?
 
I’m assuming the latter considering they call their employees Geniuses.

"Can we get multi-monitor support? Like great UX instead of random support? So I love display tech and I’m a software engineer. So every year I’m swapping out for a hopefully improved experience. 

I run two MacBook pros and they share a dual monitor setup. So I’m intimately experiencing MacOS display support.

I’m seeing an abysmal experience with this setup. 

Whenever I switch inputs the MacBook never remembers the monitor arrangement and it must be manually set.

When inputs are switched from monitors the other MacBook is still “using” the monitors. Meaning that open applications are invisible. The mouse can scroll over to the right or left into invisible monitors which are no longer displaying this computer’s displays yet they still are shown to the OS. 

Can we get these issues fixed and create a premium experience for monitors?"
"[Rant] Customer Service hung up on me when faced with a difficult issue - twice I’m curious if anyone has come across a similar situation recently, and if anyone has advice to not run into this issue moving forward. 

A couple days ago my phone (iPhone 12 mini) stopped being able to connect with Wi-Fi. Add to that cell towers in my area going down, my phone had no way to connect with the outside world. Using my partners phone, I called Apple Care to try and diagnose the issue. The rep’s first suggestion was to reset and reinstall the iOS. I asked multiple times if this would wipe my phone. I would have to back it up properly first if so, as I can’t lose valuable information on there. 

She emphatically said multiple times it would not. Lo and behold, it did. As soon as I mentioned this, and was quite unhappy as we had directly discussed this, she stopped speaking. The line was open, I could hear ambient noise for about 3 minutes, then she hung up. I later found out she made no notes on the case either. 

Just today, I had to call again about an issue with some Apple software on my computer. It’s my primary work software, and the issue I was dealing with is very complex. After spending about 30 minutes on the phone with support, realizing we were going in circles and he wasn’t going to be able to help, I asked to speak with a supervisor or someone who might have more knowledge on such a niche (but very important) issue. 

Similar to the first call, he went silent for a couple minutes, then hung up. I again found out in a subsequent call he didn’t take any notes about the call. 

Has this happened with anyone else? Very unhappy with this lack of professionalism and accountability."
"One Device To Rule Them All With how far computing has come in the last 3 decades, why can’t we have a singular device that is able to handle a dual macOS and iOS?

Forgive me if I’m being a bit Trekkie here, but we should be at the point where an iPhone pro with an M2 chip can serve as your personal phone, tablet (when connected to a larger handheld touch display), and full on personal computer (when connected to a dock with multiple monitors). 

It would certainly be better for the environment and consumers. What is stopping this from happening? Corporate greed?"
"Why isn’t a microphone referenced anywhere on Apple Sing? Am I supposed to pretend? I can adjust the volume of the vocals on songs. But am I supposed to hear my voice in my speakers through Apple TV? Am I supposed to pretend? What’s the point?

"Siri on Apple TV vs iOS I’ve been seeing so many “is Siri getting dumber” posts. I agree that this is a concern, a big time one as many use digital assistants for the day to day. I am wondering if, at least partially, it’s because Apple tries to keep a large amount of its operations on the phone itself as opposed to using the cloud exclusively, as well as not getting as much analytical data from users to improve the system. 

I know Apple was caught a while back listening and keeping peoples audio without their consent, and I’m wondering if they were trying to get more data to improve Siri, much like maybe Alexa and Google do/did?

Has anyone else realized that Siri on Apple TV is faster and much better than on the iPhone, at least for me? It’s actually a pleasure to use the Siri Remote compared to Siri on the iPhone. I wonder if the Apple TV actually uses customer data to improve Siri (at least for Apple TV). I can’t speak to the HomePod because I have not yet used one.

Anyone agree with this at some level? Or do you have any other things to add to this topic?"
"NEW 2023 - iCloud Won't Allow Your 4k UHD HDR RAW Video Files To Be Downloaded Rumour has gotten out that iCloud has has a secret, but huge, downgrade.

You no longer can select an option to download your content (specifically 4k UHD) video and get all the features. 

If you download direct from the website you may notice all your videos are now in 720p, a huge downgrade from the RAW data of 2160p.

A work around is to download the iCloud desktop app and let it completely fill your local storage with your library.

This now means the videos download will be in 4k UHD and 60fps. However will lack HDR data from the file.

"""Dark patterns"" on Trade-in site OMG I wish I'd checked here before my recent iPhone upgrade purchase.  But Apple generally has such great service I never dreamed they would screw me over like this.

I purchased online to replace my wife's phone, because NO DEALER in my area had what I wanted in stock. Got the new phone fine.  And the trade-in process initially seemed excellent - estimated $160 for a 4 generations old phone, sent me a prepaid return box, all good.

Then I get the ""revised value"" and it's $55 not $160.  No way I'm taking that, but they will send the phone back to me no charge.

Here's where it gets ""dark"" though.  I *accidentally* clicked the ""Accept"" button instead of ""Reject"".  There is no ""are you sure?"" confirmation.  Just ""Thank you, you've accepted the offer"".   No recourse, nothing.

I *immediately* went to Support.  Online customer service can't help, but they take all my information and suggest I try the phone support line.  The phone support person is very nice, but even they CANNOT REVERSE THE PROCESS. 

This is deliberately predatory design, first at the UI level, and second at the business process level."

"I was today years old when I learned how warranty exchanges work with Apple Edit: I was at the \~2 hours away Apple store to pick up an order, and in the area to visit family. I brought the defective MagSafe Duo with me to exchange, having checked to confirm the store had stock. I did not mean to give the impression that I drove there *only* to exchange the MagSafe Duo. I did not do my homework. No excuses for that. In my weak defence, I've never had to do homework on Apple's processes before because they are typically so slick and seamless. I was just surprised I could not simply exchange the defective item for in-store stock, something that I would take for granted at Best Buy, Home Depot, or in a purely online environment, Amazon.

Edit 2: Sounds like there may have been a break down in the process at the Apple store. Other people have reported different experiences in similar circumstances. E.g., they should have agreed to mail the device to me.

Mini-rant. Drove the \~2 hours to my nearest Apple store to exchange my MagSafe Duo charger, the phone-side charger of which stopped working a couple weeks ago. The unit was still under warranty. Despite a dozen or so MagSafe chargers SITTING RIGHT THERE ON THE SHELF they could not give me one.

>""Those ones are for sale.""

Had to wait for a Genius bar appointment. To submit my request. To have Apple ship a replacement unit. Back to the same store. The one that is \~2 hours away. They'll let me know when it arrives.

Hands down one of the most Monty Python / Seinfeld / Curb Your Enthusiam skit worthy experiences I have ever had. Hours later I am still thoroughly flabergasted.

Inconceivable."

What worked was updating the other devices, and then restarting the Mac Mini once it was on the latest Venture update and then it wasn't a problem!

"Why doesn't Apple specify NAND flash SSD configuration/speed Why doesn't Apple clarify the speed of the SSDs that come in their computers? I feel it is a bit shady that we don't really know what we're buying.

The M2 MacBook Pro has now famously shipped with a single NAND flash for the 256GB model meaning it is half the speed of the 256GB SSD in the original M1 MacBook Air unless you buy a 512GB model.

I have heard that now with the M2 Mac Mini, you won't get a dual NAND configuration until the 2TB model.

If Apple won't give all devices a dual NAND config (2x128GB, 2x256GB, 2x512GB) I feel like they should at least specify the rated SSD speed of the device.

When you buy an SSD online you don't just cross your fingers and hope your getting a fast one."

"Apple ID Issues Hi all, very long post, TL;DR at bottom. 

On November 24th of 2022 I was sitting down with my family to watch the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving Special on AppleTV. I logged into Apple TV in browser on my windows machine (which is hooked up to the “TV”). It said I’d receive a prompt to authenticate with my iPhone. 

On my iPhone I received a prompt that someone in <a major city within a (long) days drive of me> was trying to access my account. Now, I know these things don’t always tell you the city you actually live in, especially when it’s actually pretty rural, so I assumed this was myself and hit Accept. It then gave me a 6 digit pin to put in on Apple TV website, which I did, and we watched the show. 

Later that evening I found out while checking my email that my Apple ID password had been reset. I realized I may have accidentally authenticated someone that wasn’t supposed to have access to the account, so I quickly attempted to reset my password thru the Settings app on my iPhone. I was told my Apple ID was locked for security reasons, and to visit iForgot.Apple.com to reset the password. 

On this website it asked for my Apple ID email and associated phone number, which I provided. Fortunately, it seems the phone number hadn’t yet been changed because it seemed to work. I was told I’d receive a text in 24 hours to reset my password.  I was like “ok that’s not ideal, but I can work with that. I’d rather not loose my account.”

Now, for background reference, I am a student right now. I do have a part time job that pays ok, but the economy has been real shitty lately, so I have taken up DoorDash and Uber to try to keep putting money into savings for my future. 

Aside from the aforementioned windows machine, my only other devices are an old MacBook Pro, and an iPad Mini (I believe 2nd generation but I don’t know for sure, it was a gift). I require both of these devices to do my schoolwork. 

Anyways, back to iForgot, after the 24 hour waiting period, I didn’t receive any text or email or anything, but I went back to the website and they told me I’d need to wait something like 2 weeks (13 days or so) to reset my password. At this point I was miffed. My income and my grades were dependent on having my devices functioning, but given the point in the semester I sucked it up and said “ok, fine. Small price to pay for not loosing my accounts right? I’ll just not by any more Christmas presents, and work out some plea deals with my professors.” 

A couple days into this two week period, I log into IForgot to check the status, and it says I can reset my password on my Mac. I’m thinking this is great, way faster than the 2 weeks I was expecting. I open up my MacBook and wait for the notification to pop up. It never does. I try running the iForgot steps again (account email, phone number, etc) and still nothing on my Mac. The iForgot website says I should be receiving a notification, but it never arrives. 

I tried again to tell it I needed to reset my password and it threw me into another 24 hour waiting period. I waited thru this period, where I was told I’d receive a message after 24 hours to reset my password. No such message arrived, and logging into iForgot again, it told me I needed to wait another two weeks.  I should also add that on this screen it says that “Apple Support cannot shorten the wait time.” So now I’m pretty frustrated, but I don’t see what else I can do but wait. 

Guess what? A couple days later iForgot has the same message about resetting my password on my Mac, and repeats the above, I log in, receive no notifications, and the iForgot countdown timer is gone again. 

So I call up Apple Support at this point because clearly something is going wrong. The first tech I speak with tells me that I need to shut down and leave powered down any devices except the one I want to reset the password with. Now I will note, NOWHERE on the iForgot website does it tell you this, but according to the tech support guy, if the system sees my other devices logged in, it’ll kick me out of the reset process. 

He has me try a couple other methods of reset on each of my devices, none of them working or course. At the end he tells me I’m just gonna have to wait for the password reset program on iForgot to run its course. He closes my ticket and, a couple days later (after finals and stuff) I attempt, again, to reset my password. 

This time I turned off all my Apple Devices, save my phone, which the Apple Support Tech *assured* me was allowed to stay on. 

At this point I think you can guess how this went. 24 hour waiting period with the promise of a text or email. No such text or email. 2 week waiting period, which after a couple days, tells me to use my Mac to reset the password, I try, but never receive any notification on my Mac. 

At this point I’m into Christmas break, and have had no access to my account for nearly a month. I called Apple Support again, and was asked to try basically all of the above again. Then they passed me up the chain to a “Senior Support Tech” or something like that. This woman, I forget her name, was very kind and understanding, but not at all helpful. She asked me to walk her through everything we tried, and had me try a couple other things (like resetting thru a friends iPhone using the Apple Support App) all to no avail. After several hours on the phone, she tells me it could be an issue with the iForgot security system, but to figure out what it could be we’d need to run another attempt at password reset with the iForgot system. She tells me that I may not receive anything at 24 hours, even tho I should, but to check it every day, and to use an emailed hyperlink to get in touch with her as soon as I notice the iForgot system has kicked me out of the reset process. 

So we start the process again, and low and behold, 24 hours, no notifications, two weeks hold, and a couple days in it tells me to use my Mac to reset (the Mac that has been powered off for nearly two weeks at this point, along with my iPad).  As soon as this happens, I open up my email to get in touch with the senior support lady, and lo and behold, the hyperlink she gave me to get in contact requires me to log in with my Apple ID to function. The Apple ID that is currently locked for security reasons. 

So seeing no other option, I called back apple support *again* and was put thru all the above paces again, was handed off to a new senior support guy named something like Dave or David or something, and he tells me all the same things, has me try all the same things as Nice Support Staff Lady, although he’s very grouchy the entire time. 

I think you can guess at this point. 24 Hours. Two Weeks. A couple days later I’m booted from the reset. Dave only provided the email link that requires Apple ID to get in touch. I call Apple Support again, walk the first guy through it again, and am passed up the chain again, this time to a guy named Ralph or something like that. 

I should also interject here, that during this entire time I have not been able to do most of the work I normally do to bring in my income, because DoorDash and Uber have had app updates that are required, but I cannot update, because my Apple ID is locked. So not only am I out my account, and all of its purchases, I’m also out one of my primary income streams now too, and at this point it’s after Christmas. I have been locked out for over a month and unable to do anything about it. 

Ralph tells me that it’s possible there is some other problem going on that is unforeseen. He asks me to try the iForgot process again, and to let him know when it kicks me out again. And THANK GOD when I bring up that the hyperlink apple support thing won’t work because my Apple ID is locked, he says, “Oh good point, I’ll give you an email you can respond to via email, as well as my office hours.” 

Over New Year’s Eve weekend, we try again, 24 hours, two weeks, kicked out, I send him an email, wait a couple days and get a call. He tells me that it’s possible there’s some other devices out there that are logged in with my Apple ID that are booting me from the process. I think about it for a while and am fairly certain that I’ve done my due diligence and that none of my friends or family had my Apple ID logged in. 

He says it can even be things I wouldn’t think about like a watch or Apple TV. I hadn’t thought of the Apple TV before, but my parents (who live two times zones away) have an Apple TV. Ralph says he’s going to escalate my case to the Apple Engineers to hopefully get this sorted out. 

I call my mom, she double checks the Apple TV, and I am not logged in on it. Haven’t been for “months or years” according to her. My dad verifies as well a few days later. I let Ralph know this by email, he says thanks and that he’s still waiting to hear from the engineers. A couple days go by and what I get back from Ralph and the engineers is basically, “Oh yeah it looks like one of your devices was still active and is getting you kicked out, but for security reasons we can’t tell you which one. Better double check them all and try again.” 

At this point by the tone of, and increasing time between, Ralph’s emails I can tell he is getting exasperated by me and or my case. I am also pretty much hopeless at this point. I have had my iPad and MacBook powered off all year, all my friends and family have confirmed not a single device is logged in with my Apple ID, which should leave just my 3: iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro. The last two of which *have been off all year*. 

Ralph has me try the iForgot system again (resetting thru the Settings app on my phone), and as I am sure you know to expect at this point: 24 hours. Two weeks. Use your Mac. No notifications. Booted out of the system again. 

At some point in the last 2 ish weeks I asked Ralph what would happen if someone had compromised the account and actually gotten a device logged in and set up with my ID. He said, in a nutshell, “well that would suck, you’d have to wait for them to stop using your Apple ID. Cuz any time you try the reset process, If anyone is using or even has powered on a device with your Apple ID logged in on it, it’s going to kick you out of the reset process. Which is unfortunate, but there is nothing I can do about that.” 

The last I heard from Ralph at this point is the message about my devices “not all being logged off and I should please double check” (they have all been off since before new years). That email was a week ago and I’m beginning to wonder if there’s nothing that can be done for my account. 

I am nearing the 2 month mark since this whole ordeal began, and I’m pretty hopeless. I have had to take extra shifts at work to make up some of the lost income from not being able to Dash and Uber, and I haven’t had access to any of my music or movies that I had spent years accumulating. Apple Support has been completely unhelpful. I don’t know what to do at this point. 

Is there anyone who’s experienced similar issues? Is there any way for me to ever get my account back? I’d take any and all suggestions at this point. 

Thanks for your time. 

TL;DR, Apple ID was probably compromised back in November and the password reset has been failing for 2 months straight. Apple Support has been completely useless and not helped anything."

"iOS/iPadOS 16.3, watchOS 16.3, macOS 13.2 , audioOS and tvOS 16.3 will be released next week #EDIT: watchOS 9.3, not 16.3

Apple confirmed iOS and watchOS release dates in footnote #4 in this [article](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/01/apple-celebrates-black-history-month-with-unity-collection-and-exclusive-content/)

New Macs will be available next week, January 24th. Those will more than likely release with the new update. 

While I haven’t seen any confirmation for audioOS and tvOS, they will probably release it alongside the other updates as usual."

"Are there any actual uses for Neural Engine on the desktop Apple first designed their own silicon for their phones. Now they are putting these chips in all their devices.

They promote their “Neural Engine” in every product launch but… is that part of the CPU ACTUALLY USED for anything on the desktop?

There was a thread on this topic a year ago. It was basically a list of things it COULD BE used for, mentions of Photoshop/FinalCut and references to faceID on phones.

As a desktop user, this feature seems like potential more than product. A larger GPU seems more useful for me personally but Im curious if I am missing something that has actually been implemented.

If there are no uses, I wish they would stop talking about it. If they are going to promote it so much, they ought to better explain what it actually does.

Ive seen some comments on using these cores for ML projects but Ive heard that the ML libraries for MacOS are way behind other platforms which use GPU’s or dedicated AI hardware. This is probably a different discussion. Normal consumers are not running ML models on their iMac."

"Discussion - is bluetooth poorly implemented in iOS? Across my two latest iPhones I've had the same problem: bluetooth is inconsistent and takes time to properly connect to airpods or other BT headsets. This causes a lot of annoyance as I receive phone calls a lot through work and it's rather the exception that bluetooth is connected before the call times out. Connecting while in call is a nightmare. I thought perhaps I was a bit unlucky, as googling this problem didn't provide much valuable information.

But my friend moved from Android to iOS one month ago and he complained about bluetooth connectivity constantly failing on him. 

I feel this is particularly bad given that the airpods should be seamlessly integrated with the Apple devices, yet these too fail in rapidly connecting to it's host device.

Is this something common or are we both just unlucky?"

"Always hitting period key instead of space when typing on safari. This.needs.to.be.fixed. How many others are frustrated by this?

Crash detection is on by default on all iPhone 14's, and Apple watch series 8, Ultra, and 2nd generation SE. The feature may be rolled out for older phones and watches as well with software updates. In addition to calling 911 after detecting a crash (or ""crash""), it may notify your emergency contacts by text message including live updates with your GPS location, depending on your settings.

This setting can be enabled/disabled by going to Settings -> Emergency SOS -> Call after severe crash

"Did Apple just stop proxying certain sites through iCloud Private Relay? After the iPadOS 16.2 update was released in December 2022, I’ve noticed that when visiting some sites on my iPads, the ""Show/Hide IP address"" option would disappear, and the website notably takes a different time to load (it's usually faster compared to other websites). This started with [Apple.com](https://Apple.com),  and now expanded to the following:

[twitter.com](https://twitter.com)

[web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com)

\*.youtube.com

[netflix.com](https://netflix.com)

[disneyplus.com](https://disneyplus.com)

"I made an app that creates music playlists using AI (Apple Music and Spotify) Hey I'm a solo developer and released an app that lets you make a music playlist from a text prompt. Similar to text-to-image AI, this is text-to-playlist. You can enter something like ""Pop artists in the early 2000's"", ""Chill electronic coding music"", or ""Music similar to the artist Taylor Swift"". Whatever you can think of.

**Download link** \-  [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playlistai-playlist-maker/id1631703551](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playlistai-playlist-maker/id1631703551)

There are other ways to make playlists too:

**Images** \- Upload a picture of a music festival poster (or other image with artist names on it) and it uses Apple's image recognition to create a playlist of the artists in the image

**Videos** \- Upload a video, like a TikTok, that has multiple songs in it and it uses Shazam to collect the songs into a playlist.

In the future I plan on making more ways to create playlists and refining the AI. This is a 1.0 release of the AI, it isn't perfect, but it generally does pretty well.

There's a demo video in my launch tweet if you're interested - [https://twitter.com/brettunhandled/status/1613179511218278401?s=20](https://twitter.com/brettunhandled/status/1613179511218278401?s=20)

"Who misses the Apple Watch Edition (Titanium version that was replaced by the current AW ultra)? I have a Apple Watch Series 6 edition for over 2 years and its the best $1k i have ever spent with it being the only apple device i have not filed a apple care + claim on. It’s the titanium version in which i really enjoyed. I beat the living crap out of this thing and its still going strong, while appearing indistinguishable from the basic Apple Watch. It also actually looks good on my wrist. Recently i learned that the Apple Watch Edition was discontinued in favor of the Apple Watch ultra. I was actually pretty pissed considering that I don’t need everything that the ultra has to offer, but yet if i want to upgrade in the future I actually will have to chose between the ultra or the stainless steel. Better yet it appears too big for my wrist.

For those who owned/owns an Apple Watch Edition. What would be your plan should time come that you would be due for a upgrade? 

Go back to traditional watches? Get the ultra? Downgrade to Stainless Steel version? Or go watch less?

What are your thoughts on the product change?"

"PDFgear for Mac - An Easy and Free PDF Program Hi everyone. I’m Gordon, the developer of [PDFgear](https://www.pdfgear.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post20230116), which could handle PDFs with easier operations on Mac for free. I’ve tried most of the popular PDF programs on the market and found that either the prices are too high, the interfaces are too complicated to use, or converters not supported. So I started to create my own project to process PDF documents, and here PDFgear comes. 

PDFgear is an easy and free program, and most of the functions needed in PDFs are included:

* View PDFs for sure
* Annotate PDFs with highlight, underline, and strikethrough with customized color
* Write or draw on PDFs freely
* Insert shapes at the place you want
* Add notes and text boxes
* Fill out forms with complete tools, including text insert, checkmark, cross mark, radio button
* Sign and stamp PDFs easily
* Insert, extract, delete, crop, and rotate pages in easy steps
* Convert PDF to Word, Excel, PNG, JPEG, RTF, TXT HTML, and XML with OCR! for totally free!
* Convert Word, Excel, PPT, Image, RTF, and TXT to PDF in seconds! Also for totally free!
* Merge, split, and compress PDFs, batch supported!

You could download [PDFgear](https://www.pdfgear.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post20230116) here.

As a free program, some users might be interested in how to make money with PDFgear. Intending to bring PDFgear to more users and help handle PDFs easier, monetization is off the table for now. As for the future, some of the advanced features might be charged. But that’s just a hypothetical consideration, and I’m focusing on developing PDFgear as a better solution for PDF processing at the current stage. So I wish to get your feedback no matter it is a suggestion or a compliment!

Thanks in advance!"
"Refurb Mac Studio ""lost"" in transit to Apple Store - Where/how do I escalate this? TL;DR - UPS has a proof of delivery of a refurb Mac Studio to an Apple Store, Apple Store says they don't have it. I'm feeling stuck between the finger-pointing (Apple says file a claim with UPS), and need suggestions on how to escalate as I simply want the Mac Studio I ordered. What should I do now?

**Update**
* First thank you to everyone who replied! Today the unit was found somewhere in/about/near the retail store. 
* I had escalated on both fronts including a claim with UPS that rejected it with ""contact sender first and create a SEM case"" + Apple Number
* The retail store implied the problem occurred because I ""changed my ship-to address to that the retail store"" which was certainly not the case - I just selected the ship-to-store option/process. That said, my name appeared above ""Apple Pacific Centre"" in the shipping address, but I have no idea why they fumbled/lost it. 
* I suspect the fact this unit was a refurbishment and shipped from Elk Grove California it may have gotten some manual attention. Through this journey I've learned more of the process than I cared for, but do want to send my appreciation to Ryan at the Vancouver retail store for being kind/professional and helpful throughout.

----------
Details:
I ordered a Mac Studio refurb G14K6LL and chose “in-store pickup” to be safe. A day later I received an invoice/shipped notice and my CC was charged - all seemed well. 

Late the day of supposed pick-up (Friday 13th), I called Apple and was told ""it's at the store"" and noted that I've not received a pickup notice. They transferred me to the store and was told ""no we don't have it in the POS, but call back tomorrow after 10am"". 

I followed-up late the following day via the same process, and this time the call centre shared the UPS tracking # and proof of delivery to the store. Was transferred to the store again who with the S/N ""went line-by-line"" by their delivery manifest"" to confirm the didn't have it. 

The Apple Store suggested ""I file a claim with UPS"", but is it really my responsibility to do so? I just want my Mac Studio. I see where this headed - a long investigation and dispute; and I wondered if someone could share further ideas that may help.

Thanks!"
"Apple, it's time to make sync smarter. There have been many attempts over the years to reduce network load, from MacOS Server caching updates for iOS devices, through to iTunes Sync over Wifi. But now with many iCloud Sync, Apple don't appear to have made any attempts at making this ""smarter"".

Depending on your sync goals, there's one glaring flaw with using a portable device on battery to record content that is cloud synced, it inevitably pauses sync until the device is plugged in, whether you're out on the street, or at home, it won't matter. And it's during this time that if something goes wrong with the device the content is lost.

Isn't it about time that Sync was introduced as a service on all devices/OS' so that when a device is on battery, but on the same network as another device (which is configured to sync the same content), it will then regardless of corded state, sync that new content to the other device via Bluetooth/Wifi (as appropriate). This serves to ensure that content is securely recorded in at least two locations, it reduces internet bandwidth/load, and is much more timely than double hopping all the devices up to the cloud and back down. The development logistics would be somewhat less complicated than developing an entirely new system beyond introducing ""receive"" sync capabilities on OS' ... from there they can either use network discovery, or a cloud based public/private IP matching system (that is, when a device contacts the sync server, it records the public IP, and if the private IP subnet matches with another device, then Sync is directed to the local device and not the internet).

The ultimate goal is to make sync more timely and more reliable using the local network where possible to ensure content is in multiple locations, especially if one of those locations is a corded device (e.g. iMac, etc).

Now, if this is meant to be already implemented and working, then I have absolutely no idea of determining if it's working or not because I have many gigs worth of video on my phone sitting on the desk next to my iMac with sync paused because ""reasons"" ..."
"🌪️ Introducing Tornado S3 Sync 👋 Howdy, folks! I hope everyone is having an excellent Sunday. Recently, I released [Tornado S3 Sync](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344) for MacOS Ventura.

[You can download it here!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344)

A couple of months ago I faced a problem:

**I needed a way to reliably sync the local files on my MacBook to my personal Amazon S3 Bucket.**

I tried other solutions but they were all either too bloated with other file transfer protocols (SFTP, SCP, etc.), had ambiguous at best data collection policies, or had such a gnarly configuration UI that the thought of ever having to go back into those settings menus sent me running for the hills. All I wanted was an easy to use and configure menubar app to sync my files.

This was the genesis for my first ever MacOS app, [**Tornado S3 Sync**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344).

Built entirely in SwiftUI, Tornado S3 Sync offers users a simple way to reliably backup your Mac's files to your personal Amazon S3 Bucket. Below are some of the features that Tornado S3 Sync offers:

* **Secure syncs** - Tornado S3 Sync makes secure API calls to Amazon's published S3 REST APIs
* **Observability** - Tornado S3 Sync can notify you of in progress, successful, or failed S3 sync actions
* **Set and forget** - Once you've configured Tornado S3 Sync to your liking, you can have peace of mind knowing that your files are syncing on the interval of your choosing
* **Absolutely zero data collection** - Tornado S3 Sync **does not** collect any data about you, your local client, or anything that you send to Amazon.
* **No in-app purchases or subscriptions** - I hate subscriptions as much as anyone, which is why Tornado S3 Sync is a one-time purchase with no in-app purchases or subscriptions.

And that's it! Tornado S3 Sync is exceptionally uncomplicated, and is, in my very biased opinion, the easiest way to get your files backed up from your Mac to your Amazon S3 Bucket.

As an added bonus, I have 10 promo codes to give away to the first 10 users that DM me!

Thank you all, and happy syncing!"

"If you're a terminal user and find moving things around painful, there's an app for that - Clipboard! [Get Clipboard here](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard)

When I started out making Clipboard, I did so because I found it was painful to do certain things in the terminal like copying a file when I didn't know where I wanted to put it. Or maybe it was too slow to type out some long path and hope you got it right in a copy command. Or, maybe I needed to copy a file from the terminal and paste it in a browser. Either way, I was stuck in a pickle and found myself wasting time and effort.

Clipboard changes all of this. I designed it to have a user experience light years ahead of `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` so that any user could get started right away. Additionally, you can actually copy real, honest-to-goodness files now instead of just text! Best of all, the Clipboard app is free and open-source.

I hope you all find Clipboard useful :)"

In Steam, for example, very conveniently implemented filters by language and all information is available. Few reviews in your native language? You can see reviews from people all over the world! And decide whether to buy the game or not.

This is sorely lacking in the app store and I feel it's unfair that the company doesn't allow me to learn more about the app through reviews and ratings from users around the world."

What's Happening With Apple's Even Larger iPad Models? ;
"Getting rid of the AirPort line seems pretty dumb in retrospect I was never really an AirPort superfan, but I did like it. When it was discontinued I moved on. Looking back on it though, I really think this was a dumb discontinuation on Apple's part. There are a lot of examples of beloved and discontinued products whose fans continue to miss them long after they're gone (think Google Reader). In a lot of these cases, the product in question had a really strong use case for a certain set, but was not economically viable for the business to maintain or make money off of.

But for Apple, and their set of Home devices (not to mention HomeKit), just seems like a big misstep to lose this critical part of people's home networks.

\- AirPort could easily tie into Apple's messaging about privacy and include privacy features that are easy to activate and use.

\- AirPort could act as a Home Hub for people who don't have an Apple TV, or other product. 

\- AirPort could act as a ""HomeKit Router"" instead of having to rely exclusively on third party products.

\- AirPort brand and/or technology could be (if Apple wanted), integrated into other products. I.e., maybe you can have a HomePod that also has an AirPort router built in, or MacMini with router capabilities. (Not saying they should have done this, but they could have had the option).

\- Apple could have done this with an existing product line, that they wouldn't have had to build from scratch. It was already there, people already liked it. Maybe it wouldn't be a huge profit driver but certainly supports the ecosystem at home. 

\- Ongoing support for features like Time Machine backup.

While I'm not saying that any one of these ideas would have been a great use case (I'm not an Apple Engineer), I am saying that there would be plenty of opportunities for innovation with an Apple router in people's homes.

At the time AirPort was discontinued, it was kind of at the nadir of Apple's hardware development (in my opinion). Butterfly keyboards, limited ports, etc. But Apple has largely been able to recover/adjust course on those missteps. 

The AirPort line seems like another story entirely. Just a huge mistake and missed opportunity for Apple to support a key component of people's home internet. Not a great move, and I think their home strategy is suffering as a result."

"Ulti-Planner Calendar for iOS is now released. We think we have a best-in-class contender for your scheduling needs.  

Hey [r/apple](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/)

Just wanted to let people know about our new app. With over 1200 new development hours and over 3 years in beta, we have taken our older best selling app's code base and completely rewritten it to be faster, cleaner, lightweight and more reliable to create a new experience on iPhone and iPad. This may be one of the most mature and full featured version 1.0 apps you will ever find.

The app features 8 calendar views with a ton of customizations and a new card based UI. Other features include calendar text, drag-n-drop, advanced reminders, weather, custom view filters, icons, hashtags, and embedded event lists ... And a few more are cut-n-paste, templates, meeting handling, natural language, and widgets. And...

I think you'll love just how customizable the app is. No more living with a 'red' calendar with a bunch of dots. You can customize the app in a bunch of colors in both light and dark mode, or change to a completely different solid color. And the month view alone has 8 different formats to choose from including text, icons, time bars, or dots.

So please give it a try and see if it can replace your calendar. The basic free version is what a lot of people want, a simple month calendar with calendar text and widgets. And then premium adds all of the advanced views including a new timeline day view along with reminders, weather, icons, hashtags, and quick entry options. You can try that out for 14 days before deciding and our price point is way below similar apps.

Thank you!

"Dynamic head tracking spatial audio on video players in Safari? SOLVED: Call me dumb for posting before trying this but- restarting my Macbook fixed it. Usually I would try trivial troubleshooting steps like this, but with AirPods Pro 2 and an M2 Macbook? It never crossed my mind that it would be a bug/glitch, I totally assumed everything would just \*work\* so I jumped to other, more complex potential issues like ""maybe only certain youtube videos allow Spatial Audio/head tracking, maybe there's a setting I have to enable in the Music app"" etc. Never thought it could be as dumb as ""turn off and back on"" because I expected the Apple magic to rule that out from the get-go. Anyway, if you're having this specific issue and stuble upon this post- it's the only post about this issue out there as far as I could tell: restart your Mac. Spatial Audio/Head tracking absolutely does work everywhere, whether Youtube, Netflix, iPlayer, or whatever else: I can confirm it is supposed to work, even if the content isn't specifically mixed for Dolby Atmos/surround/spatial audio, it will work, just won't be the fullest experience vs content which IS mixed with these things in mind.

&#x200B;

\---Redundant original post below---

I'm enjoying testing this out with music, but I feel like it'll be a better experience watching a video or show or whatever. With Airpods Pro 2, I've tried several youtube videos, and a show on iPlayer (UK TV catch-up streaming service for US ppl so it has regular TV shows on it like Netflix pretty much). I can enable spatial audio, I hear it enable because of the brief pause, and I can hear the clear before and after, but if I go a step further and try to enable head tracking, nothing changes, it stays the same sa regular spatial audio. I have read many accounts of people using head tracking to watch youtube, TV shows, movies etc, and I've been through all the settings etc to check if I'm missing something, but everything seems right, it seems like it *should* just work.

Can't find any clear answers on google beyond people saying they do use head tracking for these things. Has anyone else mananged to use head tracking on iPlayer? And as for youtube, is it only certain videos that support it? If anyone has any idea what the deal is, would appreciate your input!

I've only tried it with music but I'm eager to try it for video, movies etc, I was sure it would work on iPlayer, being actual TV shows but yeah, still no luck... And I don't really see the point in regular spatial audio, it *kind of* enhances how it sounds  a bit..? I guess..? But I don't really get the same surround effect as with head tracking, even if I barely move my head, just inadvertent micro-movements seems to enrich the 3D effect so much.

&#x200B;

Anyway yeah, hopefully can figure this out. Thank you!"
"How do I prevent camera recordings from bouncing between lenses? When the zoom jumps under 1.0 the image gets really grainy and choppy. I posted on r/iPhone and the mods removed my post. I’m just looking for some help because I don’t like how easy it is to jump under 1.0 zoom while recording a video. I like how it used to be before iOS 16 where the wide angle lens was locked out during recording unless you started your recording with that lens.

I just have Waze up to alert me to any hazards or speed traps. My car was in the shop so I was driving my wife’s car all day yesterday. Her car does not have CarPlay, so I had my phone mounted on the dash. I was using Waze, like I usually do, and HOLY ADVERTISEMENTS, BATMAN. 

Literally every two or three minutes an ad would pop up on Waze. I had no idea that this was even a thing with Waze because I only ever use CarPlay, and I guess CarPlay doesn’t let Waze show those ads. But as soon as I was viewing Waze not in CarPlay it was like the Wild West. 

So thank you, CarPlay, for making me blissfully unaware for years now that Waze shows huge ads that take up 1/3 of the screen and you have to unsafely look at your phone and swipe them away."

Changes to the iPhone/iPad are marginal, and sometimes even a step backwards IMO.  The discussions have long since departed usability, and have started to get into this weird political realm.

"AppleCare might be a worse deal than your home insurance. So last Saturday I spilled coffee on my 1 month old MacBook Pro 16inch. Immediately I made an insurance claim and took it to an authorized Apple service center. The total cost for repair came up to just over €2000. With AppleCare I would have to pay the cost of buying AppleCare (€375) plus the service fee (€269). With my home insurance, (that covers all my electronics at my home) I 
had to pay €90 to get reimbursed with the total cost of repair. Meaning that my home insurance pays out €2000-€90 to my bank account within days. 

If the total cost of repair was higher than purchasing a new MacBook, the insurance company would pay out the full price of a new MacBook minus the €90. 

Make sure your other insurances have better terms and conditions than AppleCare before purchasing it."

The iPhone Plus is not selling well, but offers a moderately acceptable upgrade from the regular iPhone in terms of Battery and Screen Size.

So what if Apple were to release both at the same time? They could release the iPhone 15, 15 Mini and 15 Plus and cater to both the Mini and Plus niches. Since they don't sell as well as the Regular iPhone or Pro Models, Apple could produce less amounts of these models.

Just a random thought that occurred to me. Would love to hear the community's take on it."

"Apple Homekit Invitations Not Working solution After struggling with this for several weeks and doing trying almost 15 different approaches, I found this reddit comment which finally solved the issue. Unfortunately I had copied texts over to a note from a sea of tabs which I had closed and well, was in incognito and couldn’t find the page again for user’s name. Ping me and I will add it. 

**The problem **

If you wanted to invite a family member to your Apple Home to share controls, you would face the following-
1.	Inviter user accepts the invite but gets stuck in endless loop. 
2.	you, the owner, who invited the other person, would become a “Resident” in your own home and wouldn’t be able to change accessories or remotely control them. Call it a downgrade from “admin” to normal user. 
3.	your invited person still can not see or access any homekit and the invitation just goes away. 
4.	owner sees that the icloud account in their home is the “invited” persons email and media is the “owners” account. 

It was very frustrating as owner as one would need to “leave home” and reset and re-setup all accessories. 

**the Solution**

Straight quote of it. It worked for me. 

>	download and launch the HomeKit reset profile Safari on both mobile devices (looks like they change the link periodically, so be advised link may be dated): http://appldnld.apple.com/iOSProfiles/HomeKitReset.mobileconfig (note: you can try first on just the one device and avoid full reset, but I was forced to do both devices)

>	install the profile on both devices then go to settings to install the profile per these instructions: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209435

>	restart both devices (may be optional, but doesn’t hurt)

>	go to settings and scroll down. You should now see a “Home” icon to open then select to “Reset Configuration.” WARNING: this wipes out all your HomeKit accessories and settings. You will need to start over.

>	open HomeKit app on both devices. They said to leave app open for 10 minutes, but mine reset in a minute. This should force reset your configuration keys.

>	to test, I added a single HomePod mini to a new Home and then invited spouse. She accepted easy breezy.

>	It took over a month to get through support to this solution. Hope it saves someone some time and frustration. Good luck!

Hope this helps out and you do not have a frustrating time like me!"

I don't know what happened at Apple. They stopped caring about user experience on the Mac. They stopped caring about pushing the platform forward. Today, Macs are just a source of frustration, excessive barriers, half-baked features, strange workarounds. You name it.

* The macOS permissions system is a complete joke. Mac developers have to develop entire user tutorials just so average people can figure it out.
* <App> would like to send notifications.
* Stage Manager is a garbage feature on a desktop environment stuck with 2007 era window management.
* Bluetooth mice and keyboards still work like shit on macOS, unless they're made by Apple.
* Mouse scrolling acceleration is what could be considered, JANKY and BROKEN.
* Mouse acceleration in general feels like crap. Can't disable. 
* Why can't I set trackpad scrolling direction independently from mouse scrolling direction?
* How TF do I capture desktop audio without a kernel extension that breaks system integrity?
* Why is finder such a complicated PoS with obscure icons, strange workflows, disorganized views, complex and inconsistent states, and weird defaults?
   * Scrolling in gallery view doesn't scroll the gallery. WTF??! It's literally the worst view ever.
   * Why the heck is icon view always disorganized. It looks like a big pile of shit for most people, because they don't know how to use it. Or you change views and junk just moves.
   * If you open a DMG, it removes your sidebar and toolbar. Then when someone goes to open a Finder window, they find this useless DMG window where they can't navigate anywhere. Then they have to close the window or know the random hidden view keyboard shortcuts..
* Updates take FOREVER.
* Dragging stuff into folders on launchpad is frustrating and buggy.
* Full screen views and window decorations make no sense, because I swear there are 20 different implementations of window decorations (stop lights) on macOS alone, before you even install any third party software. Super inconsistent.
   * Multi-windowing is so janky on macOS. Some apps can be open without a window open. Some apps close when the window closes. There's no good way to organize the many window instances of a single application.
* All of the Catalyst apps ported from iOS are garbage tier second-rate software. Home app.
* There's a bunch of random hidden functionality with obscure keyboard shortcuts. For instance, they have hidden ""Save As"" behind the option key in all Apple software.
* No system-wide volume mixer. Why??
* The App Store is where software goes to die. Or rather, where it goes to charge $5/mo some stupid task. The App Store is useless. The number of good apps on the app store can be counted on one hand. Apple has caused the max exodus of the app store which makes it no better than Windows. At this point, the Microsoft Store is way more useful because it allows browsers and open source software. And, you know, despite all of the bragging about how Apple ""loves"" their developers, I almost NEVER see new interesting, high quality, curated software. Even Windows has a package manager these days, which makes macOS, second-rate, dated.
* External monitor support SUCKS on macOS, especially for MacBooks.
   * The HDMI ports on M1 Macs are janky, dated, and don't support VRR, HRR, or HDR. I don't know why. It is inconsistent.
   * macOS has all sorts of problems with waking external displays.
   * There is no way to use a MacBook with an external display and the lid closed unless it is plugged in. How hard is it to give a setting?
* Where TF are the sleep settings?
   * I only see two options in energy saver
      * Wake for network access
      * Start up automatically
   * Turn display off when inactive is not auto-sleep settings
      * wtf?
* Widgets are awful.
* If you're a developer, you probably know that installing Xcode Developer Tools tests anyone's patience. Downloading the compilers and supporting software for macOS is a PITA.

And so on...and on...

A while back I considered macOS a decent user experience. However, this isn't the case any more. 

Will Apple ever actually fix this stuff? Because macOS just feels like a legacy system bloated with all sorts of crap.

Have the app privacy labels helped you decide whether or not to download an app? I wonder if I’m in the minority using it as a main factor in deciding whether or not to download an app.
"Lack of accountability at Apple I'm massively annoyed by the lack of accountability. After an in-app purchase didn't work, the vendor recommended that I'd get in touch with Apple for a refund. Despite providing evidence of the vendor themself asking me to do it, Apple refused the refund. I appealed, same result.

You’re not getting a reason as to why they refuse the refund. You also don’t get to state your case. It’s complete bs.

I contacted my bank, who had their legal department review the case. They concluded that I was entitled to a chargeback. They then contacted my card provider, who again had their legal department review the case and conclude that Apple was wrong in withholding the refund. 

Apple then blocked my app store account without telling me, resulting in me not being able to update apps and close security vulnerabilities. After I got in touch with Apple support, they re-enabled my account.

My card, however, remains blocked; I can’t use it anymore in the App Store or with Apple Pay. Apple support isn't interested in the case. When I raise this issue in the community the posts get removed.


My learnings from this case:

1.	Avoid Apple in-app purchases wherever possible because Apple doesn't like accountability
2.	Use a throw-away card that I don't use anywhere else on Apple so that it quickly can be replaced."

"Stolen MacBook delivery, filed a police report but Apples says I’m on my own **”Good” news: see bottom**

I ordered a MacBook Pro this Monday and I expected the delivery to arrive on Wednesday. Indeed the MacBook was _listed_ as delivered by both Apple and FedEx (the courier) but it never arrived at my apartment. Looking at the FedEx proof of delivery, it turned out that **it was signed for by a complete stranger** with no affiliation with myself or the apartment!

So I contacted both Apple and FedEx, and at Apple’s recommendation I filed a police report with the Baltimore Police Department. I called Apple again this morning in order to update them that I filed the report, and I was prepared them to give them the case number, but they said it was BPD that had to inform Apple, not me.

So then I called BPD asking if they’d inform Apple, and they said no, and I will have to forward the police report to Apple myself. I then called Apple _again_ and this time they said it was completely out of their hands, and that it was now the responsibility of local law enforcement to resolve the case. But knowing BPD…yeah good luck with that.

So now I'm $2000 in the hole and at this point the only thing I can think of that'll get me back that money is to call my credit card company to do a chargeback (or at least call Apple again to threaten one). I've seen that that's a way to get your Apple ID locked, but if that's the way a trillion-dollar corporation is willing to do with regards to their deliveries, perhaps it is worth it to be excommunicated from the walled garden.

I hope that this post highlights these sorts of issues with Apple, given that I am not the only person who has faced them (just search up ""stolen deliveries"" on this sub or on other Apple forums).

**Update (3/3/2023)**

The leasing office updated me about what they saw on the surveillance footage. At the time of the supposed delivery, there was no delivery personnel (FedEx or otherwise) going through the entrance.

I called FedEx in order to update my case with this information, as well as provide them with my leasing offices’ contact information. I also called BPD in order to let the office submit the footage as evidence in the police report.

**Update 2 (3/3/2023)**

The leasing office contacted me again a few hours after the previous update saying that a shipment to my name had arrived. And indeed, it was my MacBook - the tracking number and the serial number matched up, and the laptop had arrived in working condition. ~~I’ll still have to update FedEx and BPD about this resolution.~~ Updated both of them to close their cases.

That said, **this whole experience remains completely unacceptable.** Most egregiously, FedEx should not have let a complete rando sign on my behalf, then mark the package as delivered when it wouldn’t actually arrive for another two days. And Apple should not have been so hostile to the customer when the delivery of their item has failed.

Ultimately I expected a far better experience from a company that markets itself as a premium brand, and I had to waste two and a half days dealing with and worrying about delivery shenanigans and potentially having to initiate  chargebacks or legal action. Plus it’s not my own time that was wasted - I’m sure the leasing office, the BPD officers working on my case, and my friends who were helping me all had better things to do.

For present and future Apple customers, unless you have no other options (e.g. you live in a remote area), **do not consider Apple delivery.** Other Redditors have stated this advice in the comments below, and now I will join them in repeating it."

"Apple Should Support iCloud Drive Backups to Time Machine BLUF/TLDR: Apple should make Time Machine capable of keeping local backups of data that has been offloaded from your device due to iCloud Drive's Optimize Storage option.

Apple has Time Machine to support local backups.

Apple offers Optimize Storage with iCloud Drive for those who have limited local hard drive space.

Unfortunately, any files MacOS decides to not keep locally due to Optimize Storage will also not get backed up to Time Machine nor other backup solutions that I'm aware of thus reducing those files offloaded to iCloud in a ""one copy state"" and at risk of data loss that can be caused by a multitude of things including user error.  Also changes made to those files on other devices will never make it to Time Machine unless you access that file on the Mac connected to Time Machine causing MacOS to download the file again.

I understand there are folks who have data caps and can not spare the possible excessive data movement which could be caused by such a system but I'd love to see Apple offer an option to get around this.

Just give us an option, along with a warning that the feature could cause excessive data usage, where Time Machine can temporarily download a file from iCloud Drive to back it up then remove the temp file.  It would only need to do this once for the most part as any files you are actively changing after that point would be downloaded anyway.  For files modified on other devices iCloud could use a Modified tag just like local incremental backups use so Time Machine could grab the most recent update for backup.

I dunno, I know this is full on TLDR material for a lot of folks but I'd love if I could get more people to think about this and maybe the community can start giving some pressure that Apple could eventually respond to.  I'm going to submit my suggestions to Apple but one dude ain't going to change the flow of Apples development."

"Dont trust iCloud with your Data! (lost many files) First of all I know that its kinda my fault for storing all of my documents only in iCloud but I somehow trusted Apple to keep my data safe after an old harddrive broke and I didn't wanna get my own nas system.

Two days ago I realized that almost 900Gigabytes of my Data in iCloud was just gone.   
All Folders were still there, only the files in the folders were missing.

I immediately  looked into my ""recently deleted"" folder in iCloud but there were no file in there.

Since I didn't know when or how my files were removed from my iCloud (which only I have access to) I contacted Apples support.

The Apple support told me to go to [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) and try the ""Data Recovery"" thing on the bottom of the site.

The ""Restore Files"" thing on [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) found 5000 deleted files that were to be permanently deleted in 2 days. So i instantly got to restoring those files. The website wasnt made to restore many files at once tho, so i had to restore them in packs of around 100files.   
Every time I reloaded the website the counter went back up to 5000 since there were much more than 5000 deleted files on my account.

After 2 days of almost continuous file restoration i was finally done...  
But most of my files, especially the important ones were still missing...

The (very nice) person from the apple support created a high priority ticket for the technicians in America to look at my case and get my files back.

Sadly the support rep called me a few minutes ago with the information that the techs finished the restoration... which by itself would be great news if not almost all of my files were still missing.

&#x200B;

So to sum it all up, I was stupid and trusted Apple that iCloud is a safe place to keep my data and now have lost more than 900gigs of photos, memories, documents and have no way of recovering them. (state registration card, purchase contract of my car,  rental contract of my flat, childhood photos, photos/memories of deceased relatives, all of my programming work from school, and so on)

So please always save your important files in multiple places and don't trust big companies to keep your data safe.

&#x200B;

(they should definitely add the feature that OneDrive already has which sends you a notification if large amounts of data got deleted from your cloud storage)"

iPhone 15 USB-C Accessories to Have Limited Data and Charging Speeds Without Apple's MFi Certification ;
"What could Apple do differently for iCloud password resets There's been many recent conversations about the impact of a thief taking your phone and knowing your unlock passcode (either through shoulder surfing or forcing you to divulge it).  Apple needs to find a very difficult balance between: 
1.	Your data being kept safe from other people 
2.	You being able to get your data back even if you stuff up by forgetting or losing something 
3.	Respecting privacy and trust expectations, particularly with end to end encrypted data 
4.	Doing the above for the majority of the population that is technically incompetant, forgetful, often doesn’t read or follow basic instructions, and doesn’t plan ahead... 
  
Even with Apple’s current implementation we see many more people losing access due to forgotten passwords or broken/lost devices or out of date recovery info etc, vs the kind of theft being addressed here.  Forcing users to know the current password before changing it can’t be implemented without also removing the other password reset methods that trust the same device (eg. pushed 6 digit 2FA codes).  The net impact would be to significantly increase the number of people losing their data or at least being very unhappy at the delays of Account Recovery. 
  
While the obvious best move is for users to use longer alphanumeric passcodes and/or be careful who is looking when entering the passcode, most people won’t do this and the real world is messy (see #4 above).  I know, I know, personal responsibility and all that but it is what it is. 
  
Some PROACTIVE steps Apple COULD take, however are:
1.	More user education & warnings (eg. a “Security checkup” notification in Settings every 12 months - remind user about the passcode’s critical importance, check&update trusted numbers, recommend using Recovery Contacts, re-enter the Recovery Key to see if you’ve lost it etc) 
2.	When resetting the iCloud password or changing 2FA settings - *IF* a 28 digit Recovery Key is already set, require EITHER the current icloud password OR the Recovery Key to be supplied.  This enhances security for users who have decided to enable the recovery key, but some other people are going to lose their accounts by accident because they lost their recovery key and password... 
3.	[terrible idea] Add an optional separate passcode for the keychain.  This will lead to some people losing their keychains the same way people lose password protected notes and complain about it despite the warnings they’re given.  The extra passcode can also be extracted from you at gunpoint.  I hate this idea a lot - IMO its better to let people choose to add a separate password manager if they want, and remember this information can still be extracted from you by force - there is no way to avoid this. 
4.	[terrible idea] Add a “This device is trusted” setting. Disabling this blocks the device from changing iCloud security settings and receiving pushed 6 digit 2FA codes, or iCloud SMS 2FA codes being sent to it.  It can only be re-enabled via a different device logged into the same account, or with the Recovery Key.  I hate this idea too, its a nightmare. 
  
And some REACTIVE (post-theft) steps Apple COULD take are:  

5.	 Allow the Account Recovery process even if a Recovery Key is set, IF the recovery key was created in the last 1-2 weeks  
6.	Allow old (reset) Recovery Keys to be used for 1-2 weeks  
7.	Allow password resets via deleted Recovery Contacts, IF they were deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
8.	Allow use of an old trusted phone number for password reset or Account Recovery, IF it was deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
9.	For arbitration of 6/7/8, successful use of an old item invalidates newer items of the same type"

"Live photos are amazing. My girlfriend and I have been going through a rough patch recently and I was looking back at old photos of us. I noticed that they were taken with live on and so I played them and in one she was laughing at the start of it and it made me break down crying, but not really in a bad way. I remember shortly after we took those photos she had told me she didn't like the live feature and I remember myself responding with something along the lines of ""I like to keep it on cause it might capture something special that I'd like to look back on later you know?""

It was honestly a nice reminder to never take anything or anyone for granted, and to cherish both the little and big things in life because they could easily disappear in the blink of an eye.

Just wanted to share that lol. Good luck to y'all and I hope you've created some memories through the feature as well :)"

Hey guys!

Lungy is an iOS app that responds to breathing in real time, transforming your breath into a playful, interactive experience. I started working on it in 2020 during the first UK lockdown as a way to make breathing exercises much more fun and engaging. It's initially a wellness app, but hopefully at some point it can be developed into a platform for people with breathing problems (asthma, COPD and long COVID). I think it really makes the most of iPhone hardware (it should run on iPhone 6S+), with real-time cloth, fluid and rigid body sims all running on the GPU. You can also even create your own music using a synth and sequencer (go to Settings/Create Music).

There are obviously lots of breathing and meditation apps out there, I wanted Lungy to be different - it's about tuning into your surroundings and noticing the world around you, so all the visuals are nature-inspired or have some reference to the physical world. I didn’t like other apps required large downloads and/or a wifi connection, so Lungy’s download size is very small (<50MB), with no geometry, video or audio files.


Would love to hear feedback - thank you!"
"What made you switch to Apple? I was seeing an Apple add in Reddit and I was thinking. Why Apple spends money in ads? Don’t they have a strong fan base? When I jumped to Apple was mostly to have a reliable ecosystem. Previously had a huawei ecosystem (laptop, cellphone, tablet and headphones). But the cellphone would get issues with bank apps too often, my smart watch would glitch, and really small details that just slightly annoyed me. 

So in your case what made you jump to Apple ?"
"Ecosystem question from an oblivious ex-user Hi,
I see so many YouTubers that just keep on saying the same thing over and over, that ""Apple devices just communicate well with each other"". I used to have some Apple devices back then, but I definitely did not see any ecosystem magic happening. My parents have the latest iPhones, Apple watches, Apple TVs but they apparently don't see anything either. But that may be because they aren't searching for it.
These days I myself am a Pixel user. The Pixel also has an ecosystem and I would like to find out how the Apple one is to compare, since I heard it's better.

So I decided to go here to ask for some nice examples of Apple devices working well together.


-----------
Update:
Thanks for educating me. Just to summarize what I learned, I decided to create a sort of ""Venn Diagram"" in text.

Apple only: using iPad as second screen, handoff (clipboard, files), stats from watch on AppleTV screen, using phone as webcam (although this is coming in Android 14), AirDrop with PC, signing phone documents on PC

Both: Headphone audio-switching, controlling TV, Find My, Synced texts between PC, phone and watch, ""AirDrop"" (in quotes because it's called Nearby Share on Android), Cloud sync, Password manager integrated into OS, Photos app syncing between devices, unlocking device with another device, AirPlay (Chromecast on Android), home devices automation (turning off TV when you're not home for example) - this last one requires set-up, continuing websites from computer on phone or vice versa, scanning documents to PC, transferring calls to other devices easily, starting maps on watch when phone navigation starts and vice versa

Google only: Headphone audio-switching on Windows, Synced texts on Windows, Touching 2 devices to wirelessly transfer files, being able to open Android apps on Windows and them syncing with your phone apps, USB tethering (extremely underrated, low-key amazing)

I think I put everything you guys mentioned in here. Thanks for clarifying, from what it seems, the gap isn't really big.

"What is the best alternative to guake terminal in macOS with the most closed-in look and functionality? Hi Apple Community :),

I came from Linux (ubuntu), and now I have macOS and am a software developer, so I use the terminal a lot. I have used Guake Terminal in Linux because of its functionality and looks.

I am searching for an alternative closed-in look and functionality to the Guake terminal in macOS.

Functionality:

1. Multiple tabs
2. Ability to customize switching to a specific tab with a keyboard shortcut (like in guake)
3. Top-down terminal
4. Keyboard shortcuts like F12 to open and close it

"I asked ChatGPT to summarize the changes in recent iCloud terms of service. Can finally be informed and not just blindly click accept. Edit:  **Read my update below before believing this.**

Thank you for providing the previous version of the iCloud terms and conditions. I have compared it to the current version and here are the key changes that I have identified:

* Section 1 (Terms and Conditions) has been updated to clarify that the agreement governs your use of iCloud and any related Apple services, products, and software.
* The previous version of Section 2 (Your Account) included a subsection on the use of Touch ID and Face ID to access iCloud. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your Apple ID.
* Section 3 (Use of iCloud) has been updated to include a subsection on iCloud Backup, which allows you to backup and restore data from your iOS or iPadOS devices.
* The previous version of Section 4 (iCloud Services) included a subsection on iCloud Keychain. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead includes a subsection on ""iCloud Private Relay,"" a new feature designed to enhance the privacy and security of your internet activity.
* Section 6 (User Content) has been updated to include a subsection on Live Photos, which allows you to share animated photos with others through iCloud.
* Section 10 (Apple's Intellectual Property) has been updated to clarify that Apple may use feedback you provide about iCloud to improve the service.
* The previous version of Section 11 (Indemnification) included a subsection on the use of Touch ID and Face ID to access iCloud. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your Apple ID.
* Section 12 (Dispute Resolution) has been updated to include a subsection on class action waivers, which prohibit you from bringing claims against Apple as part of a class action or consolidated action.

These are the key changes that I have identified between the previous version and the current version of the iCloud terms and conditions. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other changes that I did not identify or that are less significant.**

Later Edit:  **As embarassing as this is, I'm going to leave this up instead of deleting it. But I've learned a valuable lesson in AI being ""confidently incorrect"" or better more accurately, bullshit it pulled out of its ass.    I would have expected this to be a start to understand the terms better but in manually comparing them, there's not even the words ""biometric"" anywhere in the new terms nor ""face id"" and ""touch id"" in the old terms, to pick a simple but glaring example.**"
"My hate-love relationship with the HomePod as a music enthusiast I hadn’t paid much attention to the HomePod since the initial release because it was limited to be an Apple Music streaming box. I started looking into it when I heard about the new release. But more importantly, the possibility of using a pair as a stereo AirPlay device in macOS.

It had been a while since I was looking for the perfect transportable audio setup, as I am always on the go. I like neutral sound; at home, I have KEF LS50 speakers with a NuPrime amp and the go Campfire Ara IEMs with a Dragonfly DAC/amp. Finding a good comprise that would allow good sound and the possibility of being transported in a suitcase by plane was challenging. I had been thinking of going with an Apollo Twin and small bookshelves from either PreSonus or Neumann. But it was still a lot of weight, and the setup would not go very low.

I went to the Apple Store for a listening session, but unfortunately, laying HomePods on a table 50 cm below the ears with ambient noise does not do the trick. I ended up coming back home with two.

After setting them up as pair and selecting the output in macOS, I opened the Audio Midi Setup to check the bitrate and depth. I was pretty sure I heard AirPlay2 was bringing lossless, but there are some nuances ([Apple AirPlay 2 supports 24-bit lossless audio, but you can’t use it | digitaltrends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/apple-homepod-24-bit-lossless-audio-airplay-2/)), and we are stuck at 16bit 44.1kHz. Figure out the logic behind being in the ecosystem (streaming from a MacBook or an iPhone) but still being software lock to the lowest quality. Cherry on the cake is bye-bye streaming the ALAC library, their own lossless codec.

Sound-wise, I admit it’s impressive! They sound way bigger than they are,  the soundstage is excellent. The high feels pretty bright, and the mids are clear. But when it comes to the base, although they are well-defined, they are way too pushed. I check the setting in the Home app to discover that there is an option to reduce bass. It sounds way better; it leaves room for the rest, but it feels like a straight cut below 70Hz. So we are stuck between choosing overkilled lows or no bass; it feels incomprehensible, given the potential of the hardware.

Even with these unpleasant surprises, I will keep the pair of HomePod because it corresponds best to my use case. It’s an unbeatable form factor for the sound, the DSP is great, and the setup is frictionless. It would not take that much to make the HomePod appealing to a broader audience with a software update that:

* Allow lossless streaming via AirPlay from any Apple device
* Add an EQ setting for the HomePod in Home app"

"Does Apple notify if if a pair of 2nd Generation AirPods Pro’s has been following you? 
Like, if someone’s trying to steal a car that costs tens of thousands of dollars or something, a pair of AirPods Pro’s seems like a small investment, which they’d also get back if the car was stolen, or, if someone is obsessed enough with a person, they could just use AirPods to track them. Yes, it’s not nearly as discrete as an AirTag, but it’s still not that difficult to hide if you try, especially in a car. The battery won’t last that long, but I’d still be creepy.

I haven’t lost my pair yet, so I can’t say if this is how they work, but Apple claims that they can be precisely tracked."

"Iphone SE 3rd Gen Battery life Why is this phone so heavily bashed for its battery life? 

I'm on it for a week now and imo the battery life is just fine. 

To be fair, I deactivated 5G since it makes no sense where I live. 

I am currently on 50% left with ~4hrs SoT, which is roughly an estimated SoT of 8hrs. That's good I guess? 
I didn't have to recharge through the day yet. I go to bed with 30-50% left after a total 15-17h of activity and ~5hrs SoT.

"Announcing Notifications Has anyone had any success getting their iPad or Apple Watch to announce notifications out loud?

I’ve been experimenting with this Announce Notifications. On my iPhone 14, I successfully got it to start announcing notifications from some of my most important applications. I went through the process of toggling on Announce Notifications, selecting those apps that I want it to announce notifications from, and then toggling on Announce Notifications on Speaker.

I followed the same process on my iPad Mini 5. Yet despite me toggling on the same buttons, etc. that I did on my iPhone, my iPad Mini doesn’t announce the notifications. Again, this is weird because I did the same thing on my iPad Mini, that I did on my iPhone, which now successfully announces the notifications I want it to.

Also, I toggled on the Announce Notifications button on my Apple Watch, and selected the apps I wanted it to do so for. But yet, my Apple Watch is not announcing the notifications.

Am I missing something here? Some steps? Any insight into why my iPhone successfully announces notifications but my iPad and Apple Watch won’t?

Thanks!"

"Does anyone have any idea why many people are uninterested about stage manager I know a lot of people with iPads with M1 and A12z. But, only a staggering 1 person knows what stage manager is!"
"One of the rare times where a product leaves you amazed I have owned the AirPods Pro for a while and upgraded to the 2nd Gen when they were released. I haven't had any issues losing any gadgets in a long while (knock on wood!), so in early January when I was traveling for work and staying in a friend's apartment while he was away it was disappointing when I couldn't find my AirPods. ""Find My"" had listed them at my location a mere 45 minutes earlier, but they were nowhere to be seen. I figured my streak had come to an end and I went out a few days later to replace them (they never popped back up on the map and I had them okay a sound and never heard anything).

Skip ahead to 6-7 weeks later and I had just arrived back at my friend's apartment for another work trip. I always pay for a professional cleaning after I stay there and I walked in to find two earbuds sitting on the counter near the washing machine... ! I felt a pit in my stomach and searched the washing machine for the case and eventually found it in the dryer, sticking to the ceiling. *The AirPods had been washed and dried. * 

I reached in and, trying to look on the bright side (they weren't lost, after all), collected the case. I opened it up to take a look and was shocked to see the light go on... And then my phone vibrated and let me know that my AirPods had been located! Could it be, could they be functional? I put the earbuds into the case and plugged it in to charge. 

Thirty minutes later came the moment of truth--I unplugged them and put them into my ears. The familiar tone sounded and my phone connected to them! And then, I went to Apple Music and ... They sounded perfectly normal! After having been lost for over a month, during which time they were fully laundered, it was as if nothing ever happened!

Maybe I shouldn't be impressed... But I am. To go through that sort of ordeal and still work perfectly well could easily be luck (and it probably is!), but it still shows a level of quality and reliability that I don't readily associate with other brands or products.

Anyway, I don't know why anyone should care about this trivial story, but I thought I'd share so my positive experience is noted and in case it helps anyone to hear it."

Nothing has changed with my voice, though I did buy an upgraded iPhone.  But what has coincided with updates over the last two years is that its voice to text got a lot worse - then, very recently, it became garbage tier.

It's little wonder why I see so many drivers texting now - we can't rely on the phone to not make the other party pissed off.  But it isn't merely while commuting - it's also in the calm work environment.

And what's with it constantly trying to leave a space between the period at the end of sentences?  What's with commas placed in nonsensical places?  I'd much rather it skip trying to punctuate my voice than punctuating it badly."

I do not want to go through every live photo to choose the better more natural looking photo by hand…

Ok sometimes smart HDR is good… but always? We do not all live in Instagram Filter World.

Even the photos on my year old Samsung S7 look so great compared (daylight).

I like the ecosystem, but damn, Google‘s photos look better…

@apple: just give us more choice please . Just a little"
"Iphone 8/plus is peak design Hear me out. 

Even though I'm usually an android user, I always tried out some apple products, including iPhones (I'm a tech fan, I do not stick to only one company) 

But the early iPhones always kissed my eyes tbh. 

I'm currently rocking an iPhone SE (22) next to a P6P, and I may stick to the iPhone for a longer period. 

I LOVE the Design with homebutton. It feels and looks so timeless and elegant. 

My biggest wish would be that apple keeps doing the SE lineup in this design or even add one in the Plus-Size like the 8 plus. Maybe put an OLED in it, but I'm fine with the IPS retina as well. 

I love that you can hold this phone without being on the screen instantly, I don't know what it is, but I prefer this sleek look with a square display over the modern, almost bezel-less designs. 

I can't be alone with this"

"How stable is Voice Control on the most recent Mac OS? I'm a paralyzed former Mac user who switched to Windows because Apple stop supporting Dragon for Mac (a voice recognition software that allows me to control my computer). I recently found out about voice control and it's very promising as an alternative to Dragon for Mac. It's actually pretty similar to the Dragon software.

I'm convinced that I shoould switch back to Mac, but my question is: how stable is this software/feature? Does it crash? Does it cause the computer to lack or use up too much RAM?

Thanks in advance, and sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong section."
"Screen time for kids sucks Every day I have to set screen time for my daughter and everyday it shuts itself off and resets itself. 

I’m sick of this, it never happened on my last iPhone 12 Pro and since I’ve purchased the 14 pro max it’s happened. 

Every single day no matter what I do.

I have  attached a link for the video of it literally resetting itself the second I set times.

"Apple's Standard Warranty Surprise I purchased a 5th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro in November. Apple's standard warranty expires in August '23 for this unit. It was sold to me as excellent condition, which it was when I received it. It was much brighter than the 4th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro that I also have. I purchased a 6th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro recently. All purchased used, 'Open Box' on eBay. 

As I was synchronizing the settings of the 6th GEN side-by-side with the 4th and 5th GEN units, I noticed that the 5th GEN was much brighter than the other two. Now I realized that on the 5th GEN *True Tone,* a feature of these iPads, wasn't activated yet. But it was! That's when I realized it wasn't functioning! I called Apple and the result was that it needed a repair that was covered under the standard 12 month hardware warranty. So I sent it in to Apple.

I was just informed by Apple that the repair could not be made because there was another problem with the device. The USB plug receptacle was damaged and that it needed to be replaced. That type of damage is not covered under the standard warranty. My choices were to not have the repairs done, or to let Apple keep and recycle the unit or, cough, pay $799 for the repair.🤮

I used that unit daily since November. I experienced no problem with the USB plug receptacle. Yet here I am. This is not a complaint. My days of complaining are over. I will accept the unit back of course. I'm curious to see what, if any, difference there is with the USB plug receptacle when I receive it back! If it is returned as I sent it in, I can do without *True Tone.* When the 7th GEN iPad 12.9 is released, I'll get that one too.

I always get AppleCare+ but the unit needs to be within the time frame that one would qualify to purchase AppleCare+. This unit was beyond that time period.

Warranties of any kind, from any company, are not black or white. They are gray. In this matter, for me, it is insignificant. But for a hard-working young person who struggles to get along in life, I believe this would be a big disappointment. My purpose for this post is to make readers aware, to expect the unexpected; to always be prepared."

I would close most of my online bank accounts if I could just use Pay Cash. I understand that the Apple Card cannot come here as we are less keen to get credit cards and there are rarely any here plus the higher regulations they’d have to deal with.

"Why is changing the display refresh rate so difficult?? Changing the refresh rate for an external display is so g\*dd\*mn difficult... literally have to hold down the 'option' key to bring up some kind of 'hidden menu'. And half the time it doesn't even work!!! 

Apple--why do y'all do this?? What is the point of this hidden menu that has to be activated by holding down some key--and it doesn't even work half the time!! It just seems like a really silly UX decision... super unintuitive. What could possibly be the logic behind building a hidden menu that is only visible while holding down some random key? Is this another example of Apple hating on power users and treating their users like children? I mean really... the only reason I can think of is aesthetic, they must not want the preferences window to be too cluttered. If this is the actual reason, lord help us...

"LiDAR has been introduced ~3 years (?) ago on iPad and iPhone, can anyone who actively use them update us on its use? As the title stated. I would like to understand whether I am missing out on some features on LiDAR that some of you have been making use of. Currently I don’t have the iPhone or iPad Pro, so no LiDAR, but considering for te next model. 

I haven’t seen any articles or YouTubers talking about this, perhaps I am part of a particular bubble that just doesn’t seem to find this useful. I know that apple stock camera, the measure app and some accessibility functions make use of it. However more interested whether some applications that really depends on it, it’s a bit strange that such feature is made so mainstream but I don’t see any pone talking about it.

Thanks.




Update so far:
Beside what I mentioned the apple stock app above (camera, measure and accessibility), apparently used for

-	 extensive and maybe daily use by people that need to measure 3D objects
-	dimensions of an interior (floor plans, house or even caves). Mainly personal use, but also business use
-	medical profession to scan body part
-	drone scanning of grounds

Note: some shared some interesting info about LiDAR use in general, I was particularly interested for the iPhone/iPad, since I am planning to get one."
"iOS 16.3 can delete data on your iPhone/iPad without asking - I've lost 2500+ books Hello,

In Feb iOS 16.3 has deleted all my 2500+ books from Apple Books on iPad. ePubs and articles in PDFs, which were sorted in many categories.

Probably, it has happened because my iPad's storage was full and iOS had decided to delete books instead of caches, offloading apps or deleting iCloud photos (which can be re-downloaded from the cloud).

Without informing the user, of course. iCloud wasn't enabled for Apple Books. No JB.

Here is the story:

I was browsing in the evening, when my iPad has turned off - the battery was empty. I've connected the charger and left it till the morning. In the morning iPad was up and running, I was using it as usual. Few hours later I've opened Apple Books and it was empty: no books, no covers, just empty collections. Checked iPad Storage tab - 50Gb free space (this space was occupied by Books) and Apple Books with 0MB for Documents.

Ok, going to logs - nothing unusual. Silence. Ok, I have a full iTunes backup, not the freshest one - 6 months old, but better than no backup at all.

I was able to get into my iPad to make as low-level examination as possible.

What I've checked:

    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases - empty, all books were deleted
    BKLibrary - empty, only categories
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases/Purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases/Backup-Purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Sync/Books.plist - some titles and filenames, but not all

I've identified when books were deleted - at 03:52:

    BKLibrary (recovered records):
    Table ZBKCOLLECTIONMEMBER
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;

Then I've spent almost 1,5 weeks digging in iOS internals and I was able to identify the key suspect - some sort of ""experiments"", which iOS executes on user devices:

database of AppleMediaServices was cleaned by iOS, so traces were hidden, but I was able to recover some data:

Bingo! Time is the same as in BKLibrary when records (and books!) were deleted.

So, iOS has silently deleted all books.

Later I have written a custom parser, which examined 2 600 000+ rows of raw data of some internal indexes, which iOS uses and it helped me to recover some info: titles and file names.

Still a long way to combine all findings for recovery.

Findings:

* iOS 16.3 can delete all books without asking
* iTunes Full Backup is not backing up sideloaded PDFs & ePubs in Apple Books
* When Apple Books app is backed up via iTunes, BKLibrary database is vacuumed, so no deleted data inside.
* No info is logged about deletion - but I'm checking for extra evidences
* Logs are clean: no suspicious activity
* There are no single place with metadata for Apple Books - I'm assembling info piece by piece from many places in iOS: databases, logs, activity data, thumbnails etc. 90% manual work.

I'll make a new post later, including all details related to my Apple Books forensics and recovery.

&#x200B;

P.S. Keep in mind that iOS can delete any data anytime - do manual backups. iCloud can fail as well - imagine losing years of private photos..."

What Paint Program Is This On A Really Old Mac OS Version? ;
"Apple's $3000 Laptop: A Heater or a MacBook Pro i9?  Hello everyone,

If you're a MacBook Pro user, you may be familiar with the issues that have plagued the 2018 i9 models. Despite the significant price tag, these laptops suffer from severe overheating and throttling issues that can make the computer nearly unusable.

Many users have reported that their MacBook Pro i9s will overheat and then slow down or shut down to prevent damage to the system. This problem can occur even when the laptop is not under heavy load, making it difficult to use for even basic tasks.

What's even more frustrating is that Apple has remained largely silent on the issue. Despite numerous complaints and even a petition signed by over 11,000 people, the company has not taken any significant action to address the problem or compensate affected customers.

It's not right that users have to spend so much money on a product that fails to live up to its promises. It's even worse that Apple hasn't faced any consequences for this issue, leaving users feeling frustrated and unheard.

So I'm asking you, fellow MacBook Pro i9 users, do you think it's right that Apple hasn't faced any consequences for these issues? What steps should the company take to address the problem and make things right for affected customers?

Let's raise our voices and demand action from Apple on this issue. Our hard-earned money deserves a laptop that works properly. Thank you for your time and attention."
"Just released a major update to Dime, a beautiful and intuitive personal finance tracker and budgeting tool. Now with income tracking, overall budgets, UI redesigns and more! Hey r/apple! Hope you’re having a great weekend.

TLDR: [Dime 2.0](https://apple.co/3ANcqCN) is here with income tracking, overall budgets, a UI makeover and more! It is a beautiful, intuitive expense tracker built with iOS design guidelines in mind. And, it's 100% free with no ads or paywalls.

Nearly half a year ago, I launched Dime 1.0 as a project to kickstart my programming journey, and was taken aback by the response. I am immensely grateful for all the comments, reviews, and feedback I have gotten ever since, majority of them being from this subreddit!

The most requested feature by far had got to be income tracking. I was initially rather reluctant to add this in as it would essentially require a complete overhaul and migration of existing data models and the UI built around them. Additionally, I felt it would diminish the simplicity of the app that many users had grown to love. Nonetheless, with the help of the 300 beta testers on TestFlight, I was able to experiment with different integrations of this new feature, and eventually landed on one I was really satisfied with.

Today, I’m proud to present Dime 2.0, its biggest update thus far. And of course, no changes to the pricing model - still a 100% free with no ads, paywalls, or data collection.

💥 What's New in V2.0!

-	The feature requested in almost every support email - income tracking.
-	Redesigned input interface that minimises excessive swiping if you have many categories.
-	Redesigned category list with category suggestions and the ability to reorder categories.
-	Rebuilt the Insights page to minimise lag and crashes.
-	Lock screen widgets for iOS 16.
-	Overall category-less budgets!.
-	Added interactive line graph to the Home page (turned off by default, can be accessed via Feature Lab in Settings).
-	Insight filtering configuration now persists between sessions i.e. if you configure your Insights page to show monthly statistics, it will stay that way from then on (and not revert to the default, which is weekly insights).
-	Added triangular indicators to the budget bar graphs which show the optimal spending percentage.
-	Option to have a more compact Budgets page by swapping the grid for rows.
-	Custom time frames (e.g. 3 days, 5 weeks, 7 months) for recurring transactions.
-	Swipe to delete transactions.

🥰 Why You’ll Love Dime

-	100% free forever, with no paywall or ads.
-	Beautifully iOS-centric design, with simplicity at its core.
-	Insightful expenditure breakdowns over various time periods.
-	Create budgets based on expense categories and stick to them.
-	Create recurring expenses with custom time frames.
-	Sync your expenses, categories and budgets with other devices via iCloud.
-	Custom reminders to input your expenses.
-	Biometric authentication to protect your data.
-	Home screen quick actions make capturing new expenses a breeze.
-	A gorgeous night theme for dark mode fanatics.
-	Informative home and lock screen widgets keep you updated at a glance.

I genuinely hope Dime will be able to help you cultivate prudent expenditure habits. Any feedback or thoughts is welcomed, and appreciated. Moreover, if you have found Dime to be useful, it would be incredibly helpful if you could give it a great review on the App Store. Am unable to afford marketing for a free app, so ratings and reviews are my best bet at spreading the word about it.

A special thanks to all those who have generously tipped the app, all proceeds will go towards my upcoming Apple Developer subscription cycle payment 😊

Have a great week ahead!

"Apple Watch 7 compatibly I had to downgrade my phone from 11 to a 6s. On the apple forums it said this phone was compatible with a watch 7. But when I went to pair it with the 6s it said I didn’t have the right version of iOS on the phone. It’s been updated to the latest version it can.

Was going to try and pick up an iPhone X on the cheap but now I’m concerned it won’t work.

Does anyone know first hand if the X will work. The info on the internet doesn’t seem to be reliable.

"beware ordering same day delivery I ordered a new macbook pro for my company. It was to be delivered to my house by postmates/uber within a few hours. I received a text saying get ready for your delivery. Then a text saying your delivery is arriving. A guy came to my door w/ an apple bag, showing my name and address and order #, and my new computer was taped into the bag. He asked me if my name was ? I said yes. He had me sign for the delivery. I took the bag and shut my door. I received a text saying my order was delivered. A few minutes later, he rang my door again. I don’t know why I answered. But I answered, and he said he had delivered to the wrong address and he must take my computer back from me, please hand it over. WTF? I said no, this is my computer, I paid for it, I signed for it, I have all the payment and delivery receipts. He kept insisting and implying that I was a thief. I got my husband involved. My husband tried showing the guy the bag proving this is the correct address and he needs to leave. The guy kept threatening saying he’s going to ask one more time then he will call the cops. I told him to call the cops then, and shut the door. 

He called the cops, I called the cops, they came, were super bored w/ the whole thing, it was clear the delivery guy was in the wrong, they showed him the actual bag he gave me that the computer was in, that listed my name and address and order#, proving he was at the right address. The cops said the guy then apologized to them and drove away. 

But I was left shaking and nerves a mess. So I called apple to let them know what happened w/ their delivery. The lady on the phone was horrified and apologetic, said that should never have happened, told me I did everything right disengaging and contacting police, that the guy handled it wrong. She said he is not law enforcement so if he thought he made a mistake he had no authority to go demand my computer back from me, he should have contacted apple and they would have easily and quickly confirmed that he delivered to the correct address. 

So going forward I am going to just pick up my orders myself rather than trust Uber drivers, and highly recommend for others whenever you can."

How it works is you pick any photo (no sign-in required) Jester generates four unique captions. From there, you can choose your favorite and edit it as you wish. If you're not happy with any of the captions, click the retry button to generate four more. You can also add context, use the photo location, or generate more variants of any caption. When you're happy, you can copy the caption, share it, or post to Instagram.

Captioning 5 photos is free every day and there's a paid subscription for Unlimited captions (because running AI models is expensive), but I will share a promo code for a **free year with the first 5 people who comment** with a caption written by Jester! If you're not one of the first 5, don't worry because you can have 1 free month using the code [SUNDAY](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY) which can be redeemed at [https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY) (on iPhone or iPad)

P.S. I understand the importance of privacy for people's photos, so Jester does not keep or store any images at all."

"iPhone silent switch should be able to switch to a focus instead of just silence. Would love if I could set the silent switch to change to the “Do not disturb” focus for example. Switching between different focuses would be really great.
This would allow for some people to still call through while everything else is silenced.

Sadly the only options that silence has is whether haptics are left on.

"Apple Store Repair and Service is Really Dissapointing This is a bit of a rant, 

I spent a large part of today driving to and from the Apple Store to get my companies older 2015 15” MBP looked at. Random shutdowns on battery have been happening for a number of years but it hasn’t been a priority since it has been plugged in most of the time. We’ve recently brought someone new on and wanted to give them this Mac to use - but they need something reliable while being away from power. 

I was pretty sure the battery was the issue, but I did not want to get it replaced only for it to be something more serious like the logic board. We’re a small company and need to be smart about our expenses. The battery cycles are 280-300 for a 7 year old computer. I spent 30 minutes on Apple Chat last week and they recommended going in-store to get it looked at where they can do more in depth diagnostics. It’s a 40 min drive each way, but if it helps illuminate the issue then its worth it. 

First off, everyone at the Conestoga (Canada) Apple Store was very nice. My complaints are not about their direct service but the corporate policies they have to follow. 

They ran a diagnostic on the laptop and it came back with 80% battery health. They ran the diagnostic plugged in. I had it unplugged a couple of times at the Apple Store and it would shutdown as it usually does when the battery is sub 60%. In the rare cases where it does not shut down the battery drops really fast. 

I am more than willing to pay for the battery to be replaced. But, in order to replace the battery on the 2015 models they need to replace the top case (keyboard, trackpad). **Because the battery health is at 80% (and not 79% or lower) - they can’t replace the battery without charging me for a top case replacement! **The battery fee as quoted on their website is $250 (all prices in Canadian dollars), but with the mandatory top case replacement it jumps to around $700. Not worth it for a 7-8 year old computer. 

What frustrates me is, the Apple Tech in-store had no agency in the matter. It was clear as day the battery was failing and leading to restarts. Yet his own system would not let him order the battery replacement without the top case charge being applied because it was 1% over the required number for it to be eligible. His best solution was to use the laptop on battery as much as possible until it hits 79% and then to come back to get it fixed. Driving 40 mins each way again in the hope that they will replace the battery seems like a bit of a fools errand.

Over the last couple of years I have had other repair needs (Apple Watch battery, AirPods Connection issues) and the experience always ends up being the same. The people at the store can see the issue, but have no agency to get it fixed. 

This laptop in particular, was purchased at the Apple Store for $2500+ CAD, plus Apple Care +. We never used Apple Care before it expired and now we’re being denied a battery replacement (without paying the extra fee) because the health is 1% off replacement level according to their diagnostics. Yet the real world performance is clearly failing at a basic level. 

I am a little late to the game in getting Apple Devices, but my impression was that Apple had the best service and while they charge a lot for their tech - the support is top notch. That simply has not been my experience in any interaction I have had with them in the last 3-5 years. I don’t know if this is a Canada issue, or all Apple Stores. But I am just do disappointed in the entire process. I don’t have a lot of free time and to waste it on something like this is really frustrating."
"iCloud backup overrides whatsapp in app backup so what’s the point in of people backing up both? By making a iCloud backup your saving everything on the iPhone - a copy 

If you were to make a WhatsApp in app backup a couple of days AFTER your latest iCloud backup, then have to reset or transfer your device and install from that said iCloud backup it would load the iCloud WhatsApp backup that’s 3 days old ? Not the newest in app backup that was made in WhatsApp that was made 3 days later ? Because it’s saved on the drive itself ? 

So essentially iOS will always load the iCloud backup before the WhatsApp in app backup ?

Edit - so turns out if you disable the icloud backup from the old backup delete the app then reinstall it it lets you load from the new manual backup"
"Clean installation of Ventura appears to automatically enable FileVault -- no recovery key supplied? When setting up a new machine or updating to a major release, one of the first things I do is enable FileVault. In the past, it has always thrown up a modal dialog giving me the option to copy the recovery key, which I always do.

I upgraded two machine this week. Using a USB installer, I wiped the SSD clean and started from scratch. Upon first login to Ventura, I went to enable FileVault. It was already enabled, and at no point was I ever given the recovery key. Apple Support has no answer other than ""turn it off, then turn it on and get a new recovery key"".

Great that they are trying to strengthen data protection on macOS; bad that they have left people in the dark on how to recover if something going wrong. Disabling/re-enabling is bullshit.

Anyone else seen this?"

"I got ask to set up a recovery key but I already have one (Advanced Data Protection) - Anyone else having issues with ADP and recovery keys? I've enabled Advanced Data protection about two weeks ago and set up a recovery key before hand. The recovery key setup was always extremely buggy. After creating one, most of the time it would still say that I haven't set up a key yet. Sometimes it works for a day, and then it shows ""Off"" again for the recovery key in the settings. After some time I was finally able to also enable Advanced Data Protection (always got the error ""Unknown error occurred while enabling Advanced Data Protection"").

Now about two weeks later, with Advanced Data Protection and Recovery Key both enabled, I suddenly got a notification on my Mac saying ""Account recovery method needed"": [https://ibb.co/8rpnCkQ](https://ibb.co/8rpnCkQ)

I clicked on it and it created a new recovery key instantly, without asking me again.

What is going on with this whole Advanced Data Protection and Recover Key mess? Anyone else having issues with that?

Honestly I'm at a point now that I don't even trust the Recovery Key to actually work when I need it. Since something must have triggered the message in the screenshot above, even though I already had a key set up. And all the issues before with having set up a key but not being able to activate Advanced Data Protection or showing the status of the recovery key as ""Off"", even though I had it enabled."
"Dumb question: what desktop intel or amd CPU completely beats the M2 pro in the mac mini m2 pro ? 
Can’t see any human-made comparatives and articles about that online, while for people like me who totally hesitate between mac and windows it is legit. Usually people answer that mac offers some stuff that you simply can’t find on windows and say how nice the Os is and the power consumption. But I just want to know about computing power. Geniunely curious because in my country apple is grossly overpriced and I can get a full windows gaming pc with an rx 7900 xt and ryzen 7 5800x  for the same price as an m2 pro mac mini (i am not a gamer but I do a some 3d rendering and some dev as well as a lot of video editing)."

"Genius Bar is a horrible experience and a complete waste of time. Unfortunately I've had a lot of issues with my apple products this year and have had the unpleasant experience of dealing with apple support.

In early January, my M1 iPad Pro 12.9"" stopped charging about 16 months after purchasing. Now I am an electronics hobbyist and I know a thing or two about troubleshooting and I did all I could without opening the iPad. When I contacted apple support they told me I needed to make a Genius Bar appointment and the only ones available in a reasonable timeframe were during the work day. So I took a couple hours off to drive out the the apple store only to have to wait an extra 30m after my appointment time for the ""Genius"" to check the USB port for dust and verify it wasn't charging (Something I already did before) before telling me I was screwed and a replacement would be $800. I ended up taking it to a third party repair shop and they replaced the USB C port for $200.

Recently I noticed my AirPod Pro 2 case battery was draining about 20-25% per day without even using the earbuds. Apparently this is a common problem that multiple people report having. I called Apple and they guided me through resetting the device and told me to call them again if the problem persisted, so I did. When I called them again after testing, they told me I could schedule a Genius Bar appointment and get a replacement. So I repeat the process and drive out for the appointment and the ""Genius"" takes my AirPods to the back to run some tests. When he comes back out after 20m he tells me he could not find anything wrong with them and that my options were to live with the problem or send it in to an Apple repair center. I opted to send them in. We'll see if Apple lives up to their warranty or not...

Either way, each of these appointments took about 1h30m of my time only to have Apple's Genius representative to tell me to pound sand. In both of my experiences, the in-person representatives I met were unhelpful, uncompassionate, and slightly rude. Apple products cost way too much to have this poor of a support experience

&#x200B;

Edit: I forgot to mention. Apple will not ship my AirPods back to me from their service center. I have to spend another 60-90 minutes in order to go to the Apple Store to pick them up again"
"What is the best application for customize keyboard shortcuts for macOS? Hi Apple community :),

I am new user to macOS system, I came from Linux (Ubuntu 20) and Windows 11, and I saw macOS keyboard shortcuts are different and also not all the keyboard shortcuts that available in Linux or Windows can be done with macOS, and hence I ask you what is the best third application for customize keyboard shortcut for macOS for my following needs:

1. Launching application from the dock by keyboard shortcut 'Windows key + number' (like in Windows 11)
2. Selecting text and paste it with mouse wheel click (like in Linux)

I believe in the future I will use much more keyboard shortcuts, I really love productive tools.  
I will be happy to hear from you on recommendation apps.

Note: I don't have problem to purchase an app, but this is must worth it."
"iPhone Upgrade v. Trading In This question has been asked many times, but I haven’t seen anyone mention the trade in specials that seem to happen every time a new iPhone comes out. With the iPhone 14, I think (may be mistaken) every major carrier offered it free if trading in an iPhone 13 Pro. Presumably something similar can be expected for the 15. So doesn’t it make the most sense to just always buy the newest iPhone and trade it in for potentially 100% off the next one, rather than enroll in the IUP? A bit of risk but it seems minimal, and you’re probably going to get a good trade-in or sale value even if not 100%. I must be missing something here - anyone have any input?"

"what happens if i downgrade my icloud storage, and what is the difference between not paying/not downgrading and downgrading? first of all, here are some key points of information that you'll have to remember in my case  
1. i'm currently using the 200gb icloud storage plan, but i plan to downgrade soon (within around a week) in order to not have it required to be paid monthly (due to financial reasons)  
2. my iphone only has 64 gigabytes of storage; it is a pre-paid phone (which cannot be returned) and i do not have any other devices that are able to fully download all of my icloud storage  
if i were to downgrade my icloud storage from 200gb back to the default 5gb, what will happen to the rest of the data that exceeds it? (keep in mind that my iphone only has 64 gigabytes, and none of my devices have enough storage to download all of my icloud storage) if my photos won't sync to my icloud storage (uploading), will it still load the full-resolution images (downloading) when i view an image on my iphone that has been shrunken down to the optimized size?  
i read an article that said:  
""if you stop paying for your icloud storage, you will receive a pop-up on your phone telling you to pay. if you refuse, you will have 30 days to get your data from the cloud before it's erased permanently. if in those 30 days you decide to keep paying, all your stuff will remain there.""  
i have questions about this:  
there are 2 routes that are in question:  
1. the route where you simply do not pay for icloud storage and do not downgrade (which has already been specified that one will have 30 days to download all of the data before it gets wiped)   
2. the route where you downgrade your icloud storage to the default 5gb (which it is unknown to me what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb) to not have to pay monthly anymore  
for the second route, i wish to know what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb once i downgrade my icloud storage; what will happen to my backups? will my photos still be read from icloud storage (for full resolution)?  
tl;dr: i have very valuable data on my icloud storage that, due to financial reasons, cannot be kept paid monthly, so i plan to downgrade my icloud storage, and i can't download all of my icloud storage to any of my devices because they don't have enough storage either, so i ask 3 questions:  
1. what will happen to the data that exceeds the default 5gb?  
2. what will happen to my data backups?  
3. will my photos still be read from icloud storage (meaning that will the optimized saved photos on my iphone still read the full resolution videos and images placed on icloud)?"

So I use it for the sole purpose of whenever anyone says ""what's your email address?"" I can say ""I'm [pdc@me.com](mailto:pdc@me.com)"" instead of ""I'm P O R K C H O P UNDERSCORE D...""

"Optimized Battery Charging I'm considering taking the free iPhone my company offers - which I previously always declined.

Right now im looking into it again and am checking for the features and apps/ workflows that apparently don't ""just work"" with iOS.

One example is the smart charging. There seems to be a feature for determining how one uses his phone and then charging it till 80% and only completing the charge once the used algorithm deems it the right time. Right not I only charge my android for a few minute a day so that i reaches about 80% and have hard capped it there. Due to the slow charging speed iPhones I would charge it overnight and therefore need this feature to work properly.

From what I found online this system doesn't seem to work that well and on my girlfriends XR it deems 3AM the perfect time to be fully charged... 

So why is there no setting to set a specific time for the phone to be fully charged or even better, have it depend on the set alarm time of the next day? Is there a way to set these obviously needed settings and I just didn't find them?

Are there other ways to fix this?"

"Recommendations to improve Apple Health's Medications feature # *TL;DR - Let's create a singular master thread of requests, to send to Apple, for Apple Health's Medication functionality.*

I was so excited by the new Medications offering in Apple Health. As a chronically ill person who has more than 12 medications to track (and often change) every day, I was relieved that Apple would finally offer us something that I wasn't getting from 3rd party apps, as well as the bonus of smooth integration across my Apple devices (really important for my physical disabilities). 

The initial offering is ok, but it has HUGE potential. I've no doubt Apple already has a long list of features and changes they plan to make with the functionality but I know from a product development standpoint, it's really important that they hear from the consumers which requests are most vital. I'm not entirely sure if they have, or plan to, consult with people who have chronic or complex health issues, but I do feel it's important we let them know they could really help improve our lives with a few tweaks. 

This realisation led me to start submitting through their [Health feedback form](https://www.apple.com/feedback/health/). Unfortunately there is a character limit and I know that most people will not submit a form for every single suggestion. I personally gave up after the first 5. So I've come to the conclusion of creating a master thread that can be shared with them directly. That's what I'm hoping to achieve here. 

If you use the Medications feature, or even just tried it but didn't continue, please have your say. If someone has already made a suggestion you agree with, upvote it! Please also include your country, as functionality currently varies and will be helpful to give context to your feedback/suggestion.

Thank you in advance 😊"

"Whats the point of 2FA if you can just change your password on your iPhone without it? (Medellin gunpoint robbery) Just read a terrible story in Medellin Reddit of a girl in a city park getting tossed down a hill and robbed.  They made her write down her Apple password.  Then of course they changed the password on her Apple account.  Apple is of no help recovering her Account and of course the phone is gone, etc.

After being glad the girl is OK, I thought for sure that I was protected from something like this because I have 2FA.

Nope!  When you head to settings, it says, ""Because you are logged into iCloud, you can change your password.""  No 2FA!  Then it says ""you want to log out of all your other devices?""

Every other little thing I log into, for instance the New York Times that I signed up for using Apple's anonymous email service, requires me to use 2FA.  

So why when changing the password am I not required to do any 2FA?  Is it because if you lose your password they could just send it to your email which is on your phone anyway?  

Is there a way to truly theft-proof your phone?   Because when a gun is pointed at you, its a good idea to fork everything over including passwords."

"Can't add android to group chat So I just attended a meet and greet type event and one person started a big group chat. I have an Android phone and they were unable to add me to the group because everyone else had an iphone. It's likely I am going to be excluded from this group as a result, and the couple people who tried to add me just shrugged and said I should just get an iphone.

I don't understand why apple makes it so difficult and borderline impossible to integrate with the other major players in the phone industry. It's designed to be exclusive of non apple products. Why do so many people stand by apple products despite the major compatibility issues with messaging?"
"Apple and Uber have left me empty-handed and out of pocket - $2,098.04 dollars worth of apple products stolen from an Uber Eats driver I recently had a terrible experience with Apple and Uber that I wanted to share with you. I ordered an iPhone 14 Pro Max and an Apple Watch Ultra GPS watch through Apple's website, which were supposed to be delivered to me by UberEats. I paid extra for the items to be picked up from a local Apple store and hand-delivered to my address. The Uber driver assigned to the delivery falsely marked it as delivered and never showed up, despite my clear instructions and follow-up text messages. I waited outside the entire time and the delivery wasn't ever made.

I contacted Apple Support, and although they initially agreed to replace one of the items, the watch they later decided to cancel the replacement order, and denied me the replacement for the phone. The result of this has left me with a $2,098.04 hole in my pocket and leaving me with no other recourse. To add insult to injury, unfortunately, the police department is unable to file a report for civil matters.

I am deeply disappointed by the lack of assistance and resolution from both Uber and Apple. I have evidence of the conversations with the driver and video footage of me waiting for the delivery outside my building. My question to the community is, has anyone else ever experienced anything like this with Apple, and if so, do you have any recommendations on how to best address this matter?

I hope that my experience will serve as a cautionary tale and that both companies will take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. I realize that this is an unofficial community site for Apple and while I have no expectations of this message being seen by them, I wanted to raise awareness to everyone making purchases directly from the Apple store, especially via the use of third-party delivery services such as uber-eats and postmates.

**\*Update 02/16/2023\***

Today, I spent several hours speaking with various Apple representatives from the escalations team. Eventually, I was connected to a ""Senior Manager of the Online Store"" who informed me that the investigation into the matter has been closed and that Apple will not be pursuing any further investigations. According to Apple, a delivery was made, and they will not be compensating me for my losses. I requested evidence that the delivery was made to me personally, but the representative stated that information regarding the internal investigation could not be disclosed to me.

After my attempts to contact Apple and resolve this amicably, I feel like I have hit a dead end, and unfortunately, the criminal who stole my $2,098.04 worth of Apple products appears to be getting away with the theft. I am utterly speechless.

I made contact with a second police department in my area who was willing to make a police report and filed this under ""Grand theft"". I now have this along with the other evidence I've collected.

**\*Update 02/17/2023\***

I am pleased to inform you that a member of Apple's leadership team contacted me and has agreed to issue a full refund for the total cost of the stolen items.  I am thankful for the opportunity provided by Apple to resolve my issue. However, the refund process to my original payment method is still pending, which might take a few days considering the holiday on Monday in the US. I remain optimistic that I will receive my money back by Tuesday and will update this thread as soon as the entire amount has been refunded.

However, it is disheartening to know that the criminal responsible for this theft may get away with it. Sadly, this is the unfortunate reality of living in California. Nonetheless, I appreciate the effort and attention given to this matter by Apple's leadership team.

To the Apple subreddit community, I would like to express my gratitude for the valuable comments, feedback, and advice provided. Your input has been immensely helpful, and I sincerely appreciate your time and effort. Thank you all for your contributions.

**\*Update 02/22/2023\***

As of this morning, my bank account has been credited with the total refund amount as per the commitment made by Apple's leadership team.

I also wanted to highlight that despite the promise of two separate representatives asserting that the team responsible for handling loss/theft of items would be reaching out to me within 24-48 hours on the 16th (6 days ago), UberEats **never** made any attempt to contact me regarding this matter."
"iCloud removing metadata from photos So I recently decided to download a bunch of old photos from my iCloud account to my hard drive, going back years. You can only download 1000 photos max at a time, so this took awhile. Anyway I finally get my photos going back years and to my surprise, all of the metadata for location and time has been stripped! 


Instead of having the time the photo was taken in the metadata, it just shows when they were downloaded from iCloud now. Totally sucks. Is there a fix for this? I’m assuming not."

"After alternative stores come to iOS… - Discussion Hi just wanted to pick your heads. IMO alt stores are going to cause a clusterfu*k environment, I fear that you will have to have 7 app stores installed just to get 7 apps. Epic will be one, google, microsoft, meta and many more will i think push for their own stores. And if you have your app on one store there is no need to be on another. 

Also I fear the amount of unveted apps that will flood the market and inevitable wreck all the good apple has done with their tracking policies. 

What do you think?

"Inconsistencies with ""the ecosystem"". The integration between Apple devices is really great. Notes, reminders (more on that later), unlock your devices with the watch, airDrop etc. It would be really hard to switch back to PC/Android as it doesn't really have any of that. However...

Apple watch can unlock my iPhone and MacBooks but not my iPad. One of my laptops is 7-8 years and my iPad is the latest pro with m2.

The Books app knows my position in ebooks across devices but for audio books (bought in the apple store) it doesn't sync. Also, if I'm listening to an audio book on my iPhone there is no indication of this in ""playing now"" on my Apple watch.

If I leave my computer somewhere that isn't my home and then leave I will get a notification on my apple watch that I left it behind. If I leave it at home I don't get that notification. So far so good. But even if I go out for a walk with the dog I will always get a notification that my iPad is left behind.

If I listen to a song on Apple music on my phone and pause it then tell Siri on my watch to continue playing music it will play whatever I played on my watch before.

Alarms set on my phone will sound on my watch. Alarms set on my watch will not sound on my phone. This one I actually kind of like but it would be nice if there was an option to only have the alarm ring on certain devices depending on focus model. I probably shouldn't get started on Siri since she really suck, but a small thing like ""set an alarm on my iPhone"" get the response ""set the alarm for when?"" ""1 minute"" ... alarm is only set on your watch, not your phone. 

I never get any reminders on my iPad. iPhone, Apple watch and macbooks all do.

Is this intended behaviour and I'm just not ""getting"" it? Are there any workarounds for any of my niggles? I'm open to third-party apps, especially for audio books since I really dislike the Apple audio book interface in general."

"iPhones are not the same anymore I am a long-time iPhone user. For the simple reason that it comes with software that simply works. But somehow that was apparently the case. In my opinion, this is no longer the case. Since IOS 16, I have noticed that the iPhone has more and more bugs in everyday life. I can put on my Beats headphones and my iPhone can't wake up for like 5 minutes or so. Widgets are not displayed correctly or partially not at all, once I couldn't even open apps anymore, only one key combination helped to force a shutdown. This is very annoying, as the devices are really very expensive.

I have similar problems with my iPad.

"Elephas - Personal AI Writing Assistant for Mac, iPhone, and iPad (Ver 5.3 released) Hello [r/apple](/r/apple)

I am an independent developer from India.

I have built an app called [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-promo-sunday-1202-01), a personal AI Writing assistant that works seamlessly across all your Mac apps, as well as an AI-enabled keyboard for your iPhone and iPad.

Just released a new version of the app last week.

Update: Elephas and ChatGPT are not the same; they have slightly different use cases. Elephas applies an AI layer on top of your Mac while you continue to follow your workflow.

**Version 5.3 Updates:**

In the latest version, I have released features such as -

**Snippets -** Configure shortcuts to perform day-to-day tasks with the help of AI. It supports all popular languages. You can do tasks across your apps, including editors and spreadsheet tools.

**Tones** - To personalize text output and write in your own unique style.

**Preserve Formatting** - So that the generated text maintains the format and styling of the original text.

And many more tiny improvements and utilities.

# A brief overview of the tool -

First off, very pleased to share that now 500+ professional users use the app every day :)

Elephas helps business professionals use AI to save time on day-to-day tasks. Emails, documents, blogs, JIRA stories, social media posts, etc.

Our users praise it as a Swiss Army knife for their daily productivity.

**""An AI tool that they actually use in their daily workflow""**

It differs from other AI tools in that it works on top of your favorite apps, so there is no need to switch between windows or work in a browser window.

You can get the power of AI within your favorite Mac apps like Mail, Pages, Docs, and any other apps built for the Mac.

With Elephas,

*   You can rewrite your content, improve it or even generate new content on a topic.
    
*   You can use it to quickly reply to your emails, messages, and social media posts.
    
*   You can even use it for creating presentations and generating excel formulas.
    
*   And now you can even define your own tasks with the ""Snippets"" feature.
    

Based on our user requests, I introduced the AI assistant to iOS devices (beta).

It follows the same philosophy, wherein you can use the writing assistant without leaving the app you are writing on.

So you can use an AI keyboard within Whatsapp, Mail, iMessage, etc.

Here's the demo of how the AI keyboard works -

[https://youtu.be/Y5vrH3Clgyo](https://youtu.be/Y5vrH3Clgyo)

There is a wide range of utility features built into the app to make your daily workflow smooth and fast with the power of AI.

**One last point**

The app is privacy friendly. You can use your own OpenAI keys, and none of your data is stored on our servers.

You can check out the tool on the website here -  [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-sunday-promo-1202-02).

There are a whole lot of videos here in this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpv207Ven3s1Hmfcq9lqG74eRzJicbmoy).

**You can try the app for FREE for 30 days.**

I will appreciate your support and feedback.

Thanks."
"There is something wrong with the Mouse, Cursor, and Magic Trackpad 2 in M1/M1*/M2 Macs. This is gonna be quite a long post but **if you are also affected by the mouse cursor stuttering and jumping, either with the internal Trackpad or with the external Magic Trackpad 2 feel free to chime in and share your results, experiences, workarounds etc.** Anything that would help the community to overcome this issue.

&#x200B;

# Background

I bought my first arm-based Macbook Air 2 years ago as a backup device. My main workstation was still my Intel Mac. Whenever I used the M1, I noticed some cursor stutter after about 20 minutes of working or so. It's like the refresh rate for the cursor suddenly drops to like 24fps.

This is NOT the general slowdown that you experience when the CPU is busy or the memory is full. It can happen when doing nothing but clicking through items in the finder with nothing else ressource-hungry going on in the background,

What ""fixed"" it for a few minutes was to close the lid, open it again, maybe repeat that a few times and the cursor was back normal. This has already been discussed a lot in threads on Reddit and I'm surprised to find the exact same issues still being present after more than 2 years of arm Macs.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago I had to upgrade my main workstation (Intel MacBook) to an ARM-based Mac. I set up my Magic Trackpad on it. Of course, each new device can feel weird at first but after the first hour of using I noticed that I am still kind of unsuccessful at hitting buttons, marking text etc.

\- Everything felt imprecise,- the refresh rate would randomly drop like I know it from my 2020 backup mac,- additionally, the cursor would take random jumps of like 5cm/ 2 inches across the screen.

My productivity dropped as I had to second-guess and correct each cursor movement to get there where I wanted to get. My wrist started hurting on that very day (wrist joint issues were the reason I had to purchase a Magic Trackpad 2 a few years ago in first place and I absolutely loved the Trackpad ever since).

&#x200B;

# Radio?

I had somewhat similar issues when first moving to a USB-C Mac (the first Intel that required dongles for HDMI, USB etc.) when using a third-party dongle as this has disturbed the radio on the Mac. So back then I bought the original Apple dongle as well which solved these radio issues (also discussed in great extent across reddit).

This case here is not about radio tho, I also experience these issues when not being connected to an external screen, and not having the dongle plugged in.

&#x200B;

# Third party apps?

Some forum post said that third party apps cause this, so based on Apple Support's advice I went into safe mode and only used Safari for my work, no external screen, no other apps opened: Same results.

&#x200B;

# Comparison with Intel?

Thinking I'd go crazy I placed my old Intel mac at the exact same spot on my desk to see if this suffers the same problem. I was blown away at how smooth the Magic Trackpad cursor was on my Intel Mac. It felt like it had twice the refresh rate, twice the precision and none of the pain that comes with using the arm Mac. I need to mention that the Intel and the ARM Mac have the same apps installed because I transfered the whole installation from the Intel Mac to the ARM Mac.

&#x200B;

# Comparison with other Macs?

As I know the next step would be a replacement device, I was curious whether that would fix things. To cancel out any issues with apps on my ARM Mac, or with my ARM Mac's hardware even further, I've tried a few friends' ARM Macs (these friends also all know the cursor refresh rate issue on their ARM Mac but don't use a Magic Trackpad). Needless to say, the exact same issues started happening with my friends' computers as well. I attached my ""old"" arm backup Mac and the issue happened on that device as well. To give a short summary:

&#x200B;

\`\`\`

M1 Air 2020 on macOS 12.6: Problems

M2 Air 2022 on macOS 13.1: Problems

Intel Pro 2018 on macOS 12.6.2: NO Problems, smooth cursor

\`\`\`

(Tested with more devices too but this cancels out any macOS version issues)

&#x200B;

# Radio part 2 - connection via cable?

Then I found this thread:

[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363) (21 “Me too”)

For testing, I’ve connected the Trackpad via a lightning cable. It is way better that way. Is it possible that the radio in the MacBook Air M2 is much weaker or placed unfortunately? It really isn’t usable with the arm-based MacBooks.

However, the connection via cable isn't perfect either - While working, after a few days suddenly the cursor was unresponsive, the Trackpad couldn’t move or click for a few seconds. After that, it went back to being so wonky again, as if the cable wasn’t attached. Frame rate of the cursor also seemed lower and everything felt indirect. As if the mouse driver went into some kind of compatibility mode that doesn’t do any of the magic that cursor tracking usually involves. Like toggling mouse acceleration in Windows, it feels completely different and weird suddenly. As soon as that happened, I started mis-clicking buttons again because I constantly either overshoot cursor positions (like going past the button that I intended to click) or undershoot them (not reaching the desired cursor position in the first move). Temporarily moving to the Intel Mac, I hit everything as precise as I used to do. To cancel out any bias, I also did tests where I didn't know which device I was connected to and I could always tell the smoothness of the Intel vs the awful navigation in the ARM.

&#x200B;

# Internal Trackpad?

Apart from that, as mentioned in the beginning I also often see the cursor stuttering even with the inbuilt Trackpad. It’s like the refresh rate of the cursor drops:

[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253713321](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253713321) (221 ""Me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253395232](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253395232) (173 ""Me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252777347](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252777347)[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252957160](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252957160) (91 ""Me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253672108](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253672108) (64 ""Me too"")[https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/qj77mq/cursor\_lag\_continues\_on\_monterey\_m1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/qj77mq/cursor_lag_continues_on_monterey_m1/) (109 upvotes)[https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/u486mi/macbook\_pro\_13\_m1\_trackpad\_cursor\_lag\_issue\_no/](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/u486mi/macbook_pro_13_m1_trackpad_cursor_lag_issue_no/) (125 upvotes)

&#x200B;

# Trackpad / Radio / Cursor delay?

Additionally, I've taken slo mo recordings to measure the delay between my finger moving on the internal Trackpad + external Magic Trackpad and the cursor moving on screen with both processor architectures - I can't find any significant delays that way either. So it doesn't seem to be a latency issue.

&#x200B;

# Verdict

My best guess till now:

* ARM Macs have another set of mouse drivers, causing the refresh rate to drop
* ARM Macs have another set of mouse drivers that have different curves for interpolating and accelerating signals.
* ARM Macs have some additional radio issues, that don't cause all of the problems, but add to them

In any case, my wrist hurts. Doing the lightning cable thing already helps a lot but I still need to restart the computer every few days due to the above-mentioned issue of the cursor messing up even on lightning. Also, even with the cable attached, it still doesn't feel as direct and smooth as on the Intel Mac.

&#x200B;

# How to go from here?

I've spent way too much time on this problem already but I'm required to use a macOS device for work and right now it looks like I will have some bad time ahead in the next few years if there is no solution in sight. If you have any info to share, let's work together to be either to either find a workaround, or gather enough information so Apple can finally acknowledge the problem and address it."

"MagSafe Apple Case animation only works on the phone it was designed for… How? If you buy say the genuine apple leather MagSafe case for the iPhone 13 Pro Max and put in the phone, it does an animation, but if you put a newer or older iPhone on the same version, say the 14 Pro into the case, it doesn’t do the animation… why and how?"
"Switch from all Apple apps? I’ve been thinking of switching from all Apple Apps to something I can access from all platforms. I was looking at platforms like Google Drive/Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, Todoist, etc. This would enable to me to access my data regardless of what device I’m using.

Thoughts? Do you use services from other companies? Which ones and why? Do you use just Apple? If so, what keeps you there?"
"There are few things more frustrating than getting to the gym, putting your airpods in to find that one is dead and the other is low I realize this is a first world problem, and that you could say “well, you should have charged them”, but how hard would it be for Apple to implement a notification that triggers when you place airpods into their case but the case doesn’t have enough charge left to bring them to 80% or more?

Seems like a simple solution."

Hey, I upgraded my iPhone 12 Pro to iPhone 14 Pro Max. 

Bluetooth gets stuck pairing (It shows loading near the gadget) every time I need to pair my iPhone to a Bluetooth device(AirPods or a PC…). I need to turn off the Bluetooth and turn it on again. I experienced the same issue on all my iPhones.

There is some stuck command in Bluetooth, and iPhone does not proceed with the following pairing requests (Bluetooth commands) because it is busy solving the stuck thing. The issue remains until I re-toggle (turn off and on) the Bluetooth."

"App Store review dates are sorted by Most Helpful by default (which is usually too old, at least >2 years) I'm not sure whether it's intentional or it's a known bug. But by default App Store sorts reviews by Most Helpful. So this is really annoying. When I decide to install an app, I usually see the top 1\* to 3\* reviews from at least 2-4 years ago. Which absolutely doesn't make sense to me. Those comments could be outdated and obsoleted. For a concrete example, jumped to the Subway Surfers page and notice the latest update is 2d ago. But the top comments are from 4 years ago. I DON'T say ""Most Recent should be the default"", but more than I'm looking for much smarter sorting like how Play Store do with ""Most Relevant"" option. Also there is no option to filter only ""latest version"" reviews. Could you please enlighten me? Thanks."

"I hope/suspect Apple isn't letting another AI opportunity slip **Generative AI**  is here to stay and change our way of living once again. They’re in their infancy, but getting better very rapidly. Big tech companies understand this new AI as a massive part of all our futures. Staking a claim and building a leadership position is as important as dominating the web was in the 90s.

Microsoft announced a new conversational search feature you can start using right now in Bing AND the Edge browser. Google on the other hand just shot themselves in the food with panicking and rushing their Bard thing. 

**Where is apple in all of this?**

Apple has the tools to build its own generative AI with the Neural Engine built into iPhone and Mac chips that is capable of up to 15.8 trillion operations per second, along with Core ML and machine learning APIs. After all, apple spearheaded AI once with Siri....But we haven’t seen any movement jet

***Conclusion:*** Apple has positioned itself as a technology leader for years now. I don't think they are so badly lead, that apple will give that up! Of course, Apple is one of the most secretive companies in tech, especially when it comes to software. Apple could have big teams working hard to bring generative AI features soon. (They bought at least o ne generative AI company: AI Music) I hope we get a surprise at a coming WWDC: World-class generative AI all over Apple’s products! (I really hope that’s the case, because if they are late to the game on such a transformational technology, it’s going to doom its software to being years behind its competitors)

What Apple learned from skeuomorphism and why it still matters ;
"iPhone users - do you want RCS? If Apple were to adopt RCS would you find it beneficial? Do you text enough friends/family with Androids that it would excite you? 

Genuinely curious if iOS users have any desire for the feature. Clearly Tim Cook doesn’t think so.

Edit 1: Results:

So based on the feedback we have a pretty mixed bag. 

1) Majority of folks are open to it as long as it’s not overseen by Google (none of you use a Gmail already??). Which makes the most sense to me, Apple will always do it the Apple way and would find a way to have full control over it as they always do imo. 

2) lots of you (mainly Europeans) who could care less either way. I envy you, it would be nice if this didn’t even need to be a conversation. Please feel free to convince anyone in NA to download 1-2 messaging apps to accommodate android users… you’ll understand our pain. 

3) smaller portion of the crowd are in the hard no camp. Main reason seems to be Googles involvement or no reasoning given. 

Interesting spread of results. I sit in the camp of why not improve the experience for all users regardless of platform if there is a clear roadmap on how to do it? Not saying RCS in its current form is the final best option, but it’s a foundation that can be built on."
"Why is Spotlight garbage these days? I'm having trouble finding my most-used apps on iOS spotlight (I use it as a shortcut). On my MacOS Mail app, it doesn't find people I'm constantly in touch with, if I try to filter my vast inbox to find a specific message. The menu bar Spotlight produces way too many (shitty/far-off) results for it to be useful. I thought Apple improved Spotlight quite recently? Did they move the team to the (rumored) Search Engine project or what? Or am I doing something wrong?

(On MacOS, every checkbox is checked for results in the Settings. I'm running the most recent version of everything. It's been a while since I updated, so everrything should be well indexed by now.)"
Scammers posing as Apple with logo and all. Got my mom! They block computer and get the victim to download anydesk or similar app (remote access) It is easy to blame the victims here but scammers depend on naïveté. They blocked my mom’s computer and popped up an apple logo with a similar Apple number. They told her that she couldn’t use her phone or iPad because they were all compromised and then guided her to download remote access anydesk. Why was that so easy? We need to work together to make this more difficult. Just telling older people or the less savvy not to to do it won’t work. More security is needed in my opinion. It was too easy to get this free anydesk app. Please help Apple!
"Why is Sign Up/Sign In With Apple significantly less popular than Sign Up/Sign In with Google?

"Heads up: New iPhone and Watch trade in boxes can cause confusion I just wanted to share here a new issue that I dealt with this year, that I haven’t previously experienced, to hopefully save someone else the trouble.

Previously when I had traded in my iPhone and Watch, I recall the boxes being a bit different. This year I traded in both, and I received two boxes that to me were identical. They both had instructions for the phone and watch, I recall no clear marking to indicate which was which. I’ll tell you why this mattered.

I accepted a trade in of my phone for $550, and $155 for my watch. Apparently, I mixed up the boxes (still not knowing how I could have known the difference). This resulted in my phone being sent as trade in for the watch, and my watch being sent as trade in for the phone.

Now since I had sent a $550 device in place of a trade in for a $155 device, Apple sent me a gift card for the difference. Since I sent in a $155 device in place of a trade in for a $550 device, Apple had to charge me the difference.

So I ended up having to pay extra out of pocket than originally planned, and the only saving grace is that I now have an Apple gift card for the difference. Which isn’t really what I wanted, I wasn’t planning on spending any more money in their store for a few months.

I apologize if this is hard to follow, but the PSA here is this: If you trade in a phone and a watch at the same time, be VERY sure you know which box is for which, because if you get it wrong the whole process is super confusing and you’ll pay more than you intended to."

"Will Siri ever become more intelligent? As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, one question that has been on many people's minds is whether or not Siri will ever become more intelligent. Apple has been quiet about their releases and advancements, but with Microsoft and Google both releasing advanced AI models for search, it begs the question: what could Apple be working on?

There are several probable scenarios in which Apple has a chance to take the lead in the AI race. For one, they have already made significant advancements in on-device processing, which could serve as a foundation for further improvements. They have also announced an AI Summit event later this year. Additionally, Apple has a reputation for keeping their cards close to their chest, so it's possible that they are silently working on something revolutionary.

The competition in the AI space is fierce, with Microsoft and Google both making giant steps forward in recent months. It's not just a battle between these two tech giants, though, and many people are hoping that Apple will soon join the fray. Bing's reawakening and Google Bard's offering coming up to everyone. 

The future of AI is uncertain, but one thing is for sure: the competition is heating up. Whether or not Apple will be able to go to the next level remains to be seen, but the advancements being made by other companies serve as a reminder of the gigantic steps that companies have to take in order to stay ahead of the game. It kind of feels like 10 years ago when we had a new smartphone release every week... we tried all kinds of new UI features, and the iOS vs Android war was full steam, I'm excited to see what's gonna happen!

What do you think? Will Siri ever become more intelligent? How do you see Apple fitting into the AI landscape in the future? Let's have a discussion!"

"ProTip: Inserting text in a hyperlink within Apple Notes on iOS There isn't a easy way to create hyperlinks in Apples Notes for iOS. In Apple Notes on MacOS, you can easily insert a hyperlink by selecting the text you wish to create a link to and pressing CMD+K. This allows you to create custom text for a hyper link. 

I've found some sort of bug (or hack?) to get this to work on iOS. Here's what you do:

1. Copy and paste link into your note where you want it
2. Move the cursor within the link by holding down on the space bar and dragging the cursor
3. Type whatever text you want
4. Delete the front and back ends of the remaining link

It's not ideal, but it works. Thought this might be helpful 🙂"

"Apple Health & Fitness future? Hey everyone,

As someone who recently switched to Apple ecosystem, I am trying to learn more about the products and how to build up my ecosystem with meaningful additions. The way I do it is that I search for the products and examine their current state / features and what is coming. In general I am really satisfied with my MBP and iPhone.

However, as a pervious Garmin Epix2 owner (now AWU), this is where I feel Apple lacks the most and thought it wouldn't be the case. I am not an extreme athlete, I don't need GPS tracking or outdoor stuff trackings - I am dude that goes to gym, doing strength training. So in terms of 'workout' support, I am not that interested in that.

What I find Garmin does way better is the features like: Stress Management, Body Battery, Readiness Score , Morning Report, Step counting, and ..  most interesting to me, Insights. 

At the moment, I have following Apps: Autosleep, HeartWatch and Athlytic (+ Centr for Fitness App). There is no Fitness+ in my country. I did pay for the premium, but I still find it lacklustre, compared to Garmin or even Fitbit (I tested Pixel Watch for a while). 

I do not like the idea of having soo many third party apps, but if they would provide me with data the way I imagine Apple would do (nice UI/UX, straight to the point, no need to be data scientist to understand insights, etc.), I'd be completely fine with that.

So I came here wondering, if any of you have any info on what is Apple's plan in regards to Health & Fitness features? I learned that they have a dedicated executive role for Apple Health, so I would assume they would make big leaps here - but couldn't find any info on roadmaps or future features.

Did I do my research poorly and the apps I chose are simply not the best for this? Then I would be happy to test some you would suggest for me. For me, I don't need lots of raw data, but rather explanation of data and what can I do about it or what does it tell me about me / my pattern.

  
Examples:

\- You had only 10min of deep sleep. It is advisable to have X amount for your age and goals. Try going to sleep at Y time and do \*this\* before going to bed.

\- You did only 100 steps so far. It is recommended to do at least XXXX steps per day. To target that goal  you need need to do 250 steps per hour. Get moving now! (And it would actually track steps, not the 'Stand Time' like Apple Watch does).

\- Your HRV was quite low during the night and your RHR was a bit increased. It seems you did not get enough rest during the night, so track your readiness score throughout the day. If you would like to exercise today, try having a nap in afternoon.

\- etc.

Now it could be AutoSleep  / Athlytic / HeartWatch does say that SOMEWHERE amidst tons of numbers and data, but I would like to have it as an 'Insight' section or a Push notification."

"What’s up with Apple’s design choices in recent years? They’re just all over the place it seems like, between being unsure of what color schemes to stick with (see Mac desktop models in primary pastel colors vs. iPhone/iPad/watch/Macbook colors remaining pretty much neutral/industrial) and the fact that Apple cannot decide on what screen bezel design they want to move towards, where is the consistency?
Like most of the industry at this point, they are trying to move away from notched phones and towards fullscreen-ish designs, but while introducing the dynamic island design to iPhones/just starting to move away from the notch, they’re now implementing the notch in previously-fullscreen Macbook models—all while the iPad has moved to a bezeled fullscreen design. Additionally, Apple is still pushing the square-edged iPhone/iPads while the watch line still retains the pill-shaped bodies of older iPhone models, seen from the iPhone 6 to 11 models.

Does this inconsistency seem apparent to anyone else or am I just nitpicking? How do you feel about the trends in Apple’s design choices of recent years?"

"What do YOU do with your MacBook, and what can you teach me? My M2 Max got delayed so I thought to make this post to help fill my void. I’m looking for a bunch of ideas and suggestions on what I can do with my new computer. For some context, it’s my first Mac. I had a PC like 10 years ago and finally needed to update and since everything else I have is in the ecosystem I went with a MacBook this time. 

I’d love to learn new things such as coding, whether it be in app development or in data science. I have friends that do both and it seems interesting and fun. I have started to get into photography as well, I have a 13 Pro and I love taking photos with it. I do a lot of cooking and frequently write down my recipes and take photos in case I ever want to create content. 

What do you guys use your MacBooks for? What programs do you recommend? Any specific courses for improving my skills or learning new ones? I’m in my mid-late 20’s, don’t even work in my degree, and might be looking to move to a new city, so if I get good at any of this stuff I’ll definitely switch it up haha. 

Thanks for your help everyone!

Edit: To everyone telling me to cancel the order, half the cost of this was covered so I’m paying 2 grand for a 4k machine. I’m not cancelling, I’d rather have an overpowered machine that I can learn to utilize in time rather than one that I’ll need to upgrade again later. I appreciate you guys looking after my wallet all the same."

Personally l use whatever gets the job done, and it feels like that is such a low bar now be it Windows vs Mac or Android vs iOS. Cheap and expensive devices alike are incredibly powerful, versatile, fast and efficient.

On the Android side all anyone seems to care about are foldables, and now each OEM is really trying to make their own ""thing"". Pixel wants AI, computational photography and automation to be its thing, and these are useful, but far from earth shattering. It all just doesn't feel as exciting as it once was, everything is plateauing. I'm so bored looking at benchmarks and tiny little tweaks to numbers.

I'm curious to see where you all think the industry is going? Are phones simply an upgrade every 2-3 years now thing or is the industry going to rock itself again? Has the industry matured and have we reached (or are near) peak smartphone?"

"I created a Smart Diary that allows you to have your own AI. Called Moolight - Smart Diary [Download Moolight - Smart Diary](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/moodlight-intelligent-note/id1631169735)

Instead of writing a long journal, I love taking short notes throughout the day, in a bullet point format. In this way, I could better record the thoughts that could otherwise be forgotten.

My girlfriend writes diary every day. The problem she had is that after writing for years, there is no good way to see the changes in yourself, even though all texts are there.

We tried very hard to search for an app that could fit our need. But failed. **As a result, we took a lot of time to learn and develop our first take on this idea. Of a smart note app.**

**Moolight** is our answer. It features an on-device AI that could help us organize the piece of ideas into 15 categories. And try to provide some insights and feedbacks from all the notes automatically.

We don't want to sacrifice any privacy, as a result, a decision is made to keep all data to yourself & your own iCloud. After tested out the idea, we found a way to make it even smarter and fit your own record style. As a result, you could train your absolutely unique AI on your device in Moolight.

The more you write and correct the category, the better your own AI gets. In our own test, with the default AI, the accuracy is about 70% correctness. If you write for about 20 days with 5 bullet points per day, and correct the category. Your could own a unique AI that do chores sorting out your notes 100% categories correctness for all your notes.

&#x200B;

**Why bother creating another note app?**

Complex tools makes it's easy to get lost. When using simple tools, the notes could easily scattered everywhere. Why can't software help? We live in an age when technology advances every day, yet the software for notes seem to become unchanged since long time ago.

That's why we spent long time, realizing this idea. And had great fun developing this product. The idea is about writing without being disturbed. Enjoy the ease of use brought by technological advances while having absolute privacy.

&#x200B;

**Design Thoughts**

My girlfriend is a data scientist, and I had background in software and design. We wanna to combine our experiences, and attempt to give this idea our best effort. Since day one, we discussed and settled on the following ground rules:

1. We believe everyone should be the sole owner of our data, especially in a case for note or diary. So data never leaves your device or iCloud. All data should be processed on-device with neural engine. It should be 100% functional when offline.
2. We wanna it to be smart, to make life easier. To do this, it should know how we feel when we write; It should know the realtime weather so my gf don't need to type in manually; It should know I'm writing about food, without specifying the category. It should be able to track anything that we ever want to know if we wrote about it.
3. We wanna it to be able to think. To write a short headline each day and help us recall. It should know the top content I'm constantly writing about, and use my data to give us some feedback. We wanna it know them all, yet do not ask for any information besides what I actually write.

&#x200B;

**Why there are three tabs?**

Today, Gallery and Insights.

The idea is that whenever you want to write something, it's in the Today tab, this is where you focus on the moment. When you want to have a look at the past. All the information is well organized and truthfully present to you in Gallery tab.

We can't predict the future. However, in some way, we could also get a glimpse of idea about future based on what we were doing in the past. This is what Insights tab do.

▶ Today ◀ • Bullet Based Input • Automatic added Weather & Location • Mood Lights to Know Your Feeling • Time Travel to Past and Future • Dynamic Background that Flows.

▶ Gallery ◀ • Refined Card with Mood Color • Daily Auto Headline • Auto Classification for Each Input • Powerful Search by Time and Types.

▶ Insights ◀• Cumulative Days, and Inputs Count • Weekly Glance to be Surprised • Keyword to Know What Mattered • Track Anything as Tags • Know What made you Happy with Mood Trend • Random Show to Recall Memories • Mapped Journey to Mark your Path • Liked/Web Records to Shortcut • Customize Modules on Your Preference.

• iCloud Sync and Backup for iPhone/iPad/Mac • Face ID for Additional Safety • Customize Color, Typography, etc • Recycled Bin for Accidental Delete • Automatic Light and Dark Mode.

&#x200B;

**What can it do?**

**• Intelligent Classification**

Declutter the life events. Work, Food, Study and so on. It just knows.

**• Understand Your Mood**

How’s your day? Moolight will do the best guess.

**• Multiple Organizers**

Event, Emotions, Keywords, Maps, etc. Multiple ways to visualize the data.

&#x200B;

Since it's unlike any existing note or diary product in the market. It takes time to get familiar with Moolight, and once you get familiar with it, hopefully you'll grow the love of it like we did. Moolight is released to the App Store on the first day of 2023. And we're still trying very hard to polish it.

Would love to hear your thoughts about it."

"Have the M series Macs killed the “replace a Mac with the iPad” movement? I know personally, I went from wanting to try and get an iPad Pro 12.9 to use a travel laptop to getting the M1 MacBook Pro as soon as I could. 

Now I don’t particular need/want a large iPad as the MacBooks now have the battery life and speed to match what I wanted. Anyone else think this applies to the whole “iPad as a computer” movement?

I think the only thing Apple is missing is some kind of entry level MacBook like the old style plastic MacBooks from circa ~2008"

"What’s your biggest gripe with apple products? Mine is how macOS handles external displays compared to windows. That alone made me want to switch to a windows laptop for a time. 

What about you? Some others in my list are:

1. Charging obscene prices for storage

2. Having 8gb of ram in 2023 in a $1000 laptop 

3. How buggy new OS releases are. I was honestly shocked when I got the iPhone 14 pro max and upgraded to the new IOS how buggy it was for a few months."
"PSA: Don’t let Apple deny your request to update Date of Purchase for a brand new previous-gen product. Had to escalate to manager level to get them to do it. Just got off the phone with Apple in what was an super frustrating experience from a company that brags about its consumer-friendly policy. 

I just bought a Series 6 from an online retailer just last week and set it up today. After set up, I noticed that it said “Coverage Expired”. Weird but no biggie, I’ll just call Apple and it’ll be sorted out soon. Or so I thought. 

First CSR asked me to provide proof of payment which I gladly did. I even screenshared my phone to show the receipt in my email. He asked me to upload my screenshots. No problemo. He then transfers me to another CSR.

I’m 20 minutes into what I thought would be 5 mins. The second CSR informs me that due to the fact that it’s a Series 6 they can’t update the Date of Purchase. Excuse me? I bought it brand new from a reputable retailer (Sportchek). It wasn’t open box or anything. The box was sealed. The CSR gives me this gem: because the AW was shipped to the retailer in 2020, they cannot update the Date of Purchase. 

This was shocking to hear. I told her that it doesn’t matter to me as the end consumer when a product was shipped to the retailer. I bought it new and they have to honour the manufacturer’s warranty. She transfers me to her manager. 

I’m now 45 minutes into this call. Manager gets on the phone and asks me what the issue was. I explained how I’m being told that Apple does not cover its own new products just because of when they were shipped to a retailer. She apologizes and agrees with me and goes ahead and approves the update to the Date of Purchase. Finally!! 

Took me almost an hour on the phone to get done what should have never been an issue in the first place. So DO NOT let Apple reject your request to update the Date of Purchase if you bought a NEW Apple product. Consumer laws exist to protect the end users from this sort of bs."
"Is it possible? Communication with no signal in Airplane mode between iPhones or Apple Watches for hiking?? Ok so many times no service is quite common when hiking. Ideally it would be awesome to use the walk-talkie watchOS app so we can chat and be within a kilometre or half mile of each other… or within the device’s overlapping wifi range? Is this a thing with a custom app perhaps? We tried the wallow-talkie app in airplane mode but no luck. 

I would love any possible advice 😇"
"New HomePods vs Original HomePods Has anyone else got a chance to set up their new HomePods in a pair?

I bought 3 today and used 2 of them to replace the pair in my Bedroom. 

The audio quality is unbearably worse than the originals. They have harsh mids that are not present on any other speakers. It’s around 1.5khz -2khz. 

The bass is also very lacking. I am going to have to return these two because the sound isn’t just not as good, it is harsh on the ears. 

Just looking for input from anyone else that is hearing this right now."

"Discussion: The friction between using an iPhone and Windows Computer I have an iPhone. I also have a Windows PC at home and use a Windows PC at work. I use the Windows PC at work because I must, and I use the Windows PC at home because it’s a requirement for my online Business Administration Degree. Additionally, I've always liked Windows because it's what I'm used to. 

Most of my personal life is on my iPhone. The native calendar, reminder, and notes app all seamlessly connect to help me manage my life and be productive. I have notes integrated with the reminders app and reminders set out way into the future. This runs my life.

I’m really loving using Windows more and more every day. Whether it’s for school, work, or for personal use. The programs I’ve used are so feature rich. They’re a pleasure to use and find out all the possible capabilities that can help me be productive. Lately, I’ve been learning more and more about Excel and OneNote. It’s honestly been fun and I’m enjoying myself quite a bit.

This leads me to a point of friction. I love using Windows App’s on my PC, but my whole life is wrapped up on an iPhone which I also enjoy. The webpages for iPhone apps are quite garbage (looking at you Apple Notes). I’m considering making the switch from Apple to Windows and migrating all my notes and reminders to Windows apps. 

My question is this: Is it worth it? For those with an iPhone and Windows PC, which apps do you use to manage your personal life? Are you frustrated with the limitations? More generally, what is your workflow?"

"Why do modern iPads have worse battery life than older generations? My first Apple product was an iPad Air 2. Which I love, and still have to this day. I got an iPad Pro 2020 two years ago, and have been using it and have my older Air 2 to my mom. 

Recently I was using the Air 2 again, and realised it had such a better battery life vs the Pro. Despite being several years older (battery deterioration), it has crazy good standby time and lasts longer whole browsing or watching videos. Have Apple optimised their newer iPads for more power vs battery life? 

I have to say I feel like I need to charge my iPad Pro quite often. While only browsing and consuming media."

The Max has a more distant-sounding soundstage, but not wider than the AirPod Pro's. Apple has their work cut out for them for the next version of the Max.

I also use a high resolution ultra wide screen and that alone was heating up my previous MBP due to the strain on the GPU.

Before, even video calls would have the fans blow like crazy. Now I have yet to find a task that makes the M2 sweat even a little bit.

Kuo: Apple Likely to Launch Refreshed iPad Mini Early Next Year ;

"Is it possible for a Maldivian student to get the student discount on MacBook? I heard apple gives student discounts. I just want to find if I am eligible and how to get the discount. So far I made so many threads in different subreddits and tried to contact apple and am unable to contact apple. So far I had no luck and even asked the question here in mega thread. It seems no one understand how to do it unless you are a student in USA or a large nation with apple stores in it.

Thank You"
"Of all products Apple could make, I think I want the return of the 12in MacBook the most. I had a 12in MacBook a few years ago. For a daily driver it was a bit on the small side. However for a small full featured laptop that was incredibly easy to pack for travel I miss that device a lot. I have gotten out of the habit of packing my MacBook Pro 14 for my iPad because of size, but I really miss having the full macOS with me. I also have a M1 MacBook Air, but that extra inch seems to make a difference to me.

Am I the only one or are there others?"

"I've just released Pestle 1.4 with Smart Folders, PDF Import, Image Import and more! Hey r/Apple! 

I'm Will, a 20-year-old developer from Adelaide, Australia. I build [Pestle, an intelligent recipe manager for iPhone & iPad](https://apple.co/3sWeyWl) (The Mac version is coming along well, and it will be worth the wait!).

If you're not already familiar with Pestle, [checkout the launch post from 6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/sgctww/ive_just_released_pestle_transform_any_recipe/). But in short, Pestle is a Recipe Organiser that lets you save recipes from any website.

# Smart Folders

This is one is really cool! Pestle now has 'Smart Folders', which fill themselves up based on the criteria you set. Want to filter your 400 recipes down to just 4-star or higher desserts that aren't alcoholic beverages? Easy! As you save new recipes to Pestle, they'll automatically be added to your Smart Folders.

# PDF Import

This one is for those of you with Cookbooks as PDFs. Pestle can now show you your PDF Cookbook and will guide you through adding your favourites to Pestle. Once saved, Pestle will use its smarts to enable you to scale recipes, convert them, and more. 

# Image Import

Much like PDF Importing, Pestle can now handle photos you've taken of recipe cards and the like, with Live Text on iOS 16, scanning photos into Pestle is a breeze.

### Search Improvements

This is a smaller one, but worth a mention. Sometimes when searching across your large collection, exactly _why_ a recipe shows up might not be clear. You may search for ""Italian"", and a recipe with ""Italian Herbs"" will show up. Now search results will show in the top right exactly _why_ they're there, like ""Matches Ingredient"" or ""Main Course"".

# Privacy First

Frankly, it's none of my business what you cook with Pestle, where you share it to, etc etc. That's why the [Privacy Policy](https://pestlechef.app/privacy) is so short, there's very little for me to say. First and foremost, **Pestle does not collection identifiable information** (with the only exception of your email, if you even consider that identifiable, and also only **if you use email signup**, if you use Sign In with Apple/Google, then this doesn’t apply. For analytical purposes, I do track daily active users, version breakdowns and such. **But none of this information is tracked back to you, it is 100% anonymous**. I use [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com), a privacy-focused platform use by many other popular apps, such as Apollo for Reddit.


That sums up this update, it's my biggest update since releasing Live Activities (among other things), so I hope you like it :)

I would love for you to give it a try, so go get [Pestle on the App Store](https://apple.co/3sWeyWl)!"
"If you travel often using public transit you might find Glarm useful. It’s an app that notifies you whenever you’re closing in on your destination and it’s been recently updated for iOS 16! [Glarm is available for free in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/glarm-location-based-alarms/id1523237367)

If you’re like me and you travel a lot by train, or bus you might not always recognize railway stations or tell quickly how far is your stop, so you start nervously checking the time and position on the map.

With Glarm you can set alarm to ring, let’s say 5 kilometres from your destination and in the meantime, take a nap, or watch a movie without worrying about missing the stop.

**It was recently updated with support for Live Activities on iOS 16** so now you can track the distance from the destination on your lock screen.

Let me know what you think about it and have a wonderful Sunday!"
"I just released Oolong v2, a ""future forward"" budget app that can help you control the ""shape"" of your money! Hey /r/apple, 

Just launched Oolong *v2* after two years of doing other... stuff 🙈

#### [GET IT HERE](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1549289924)

---

**TL;DR:** 

Oolong is a ""future forward"" budget app that helps users control the ""shape"" of their money. Whereas other apps like Mint, YNAB, and [Envy](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/q5dd4a/i_created_a_budgeting_app_that_doesnt_collect_any/) are great at helping users understand ""what happened"", Oolong is all about predicting ""what *will* happen"" so that you can make smarter financial decisions **today**.

---

**What's New?**

Oolong is the reason I picked up iOS development 3 years ago. The [original app](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/) was, admittedly pretty basic, but it got the job done! This latest version is everything that I've learned a lot about building enterprise apps over these last couple years along with: 

- Completely new design (as requested by [/u/Darpyface](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glj008n/))
- Balance Sheets and Income Statements
- Multiple Accounts (as requested by [/u/John-McAfee](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glicfor/))
- Decimals! (as requested by [/u/lizadting](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/gli07qb/))

---

**Use cases**

I've been using the Oolong methodology for over a decade (then just an Excel spreadsheet). It's the singular tool that I use to manage my money. Hearing from several v1 users, many have used Oolong to: 

- Figure out how much to allocate to savings/investments
- Plan major one-time purchases
- Figure out ""how much apartment"" to rent/buy

---

**Freemium**

Oolong is free for the first 3 accounts (assets/liabilities) and 7 plan items (incomes/transfers/expenses). An ""In App Upgrade"" can be purchased to unlock unlimited accounts and plan items, as well as remove ads.

I really think that Oolong can help users escape the ""paycheck-to-paycheck"" trap. So, if you use and love Oolong, but can't afford the upgrade right now, please send me a quick email at oolong@bracket.ltd with a little explanation about how you hope to use Oolong to improve finances and I'll endeavour to send you a code!

MacBook Pro 14 (2023) features improved display response times ;
"Is this the Mandela effect, or did Apple announce wireless Bluetooth or NCF tags for retailers around 2015?  I've tried looking into this for a little while and I can find no trace of it on the internet.

I swear I have a memory from probably around 2015 of a WWDC video where Tim Cook was advertising NFC/Bluetooth/similar devices to brick and mortar retailers. I cant remember what their value proposition was, but it provided some digital services to customers.  Maybe you download apps, order online, or similar - basically a glorified QR code. Sorry, my memory is very patchy.

Outside of the mention at the WWDC, I have no other memory of it (never saw it on their website, in person, etc). That, plus me being unable to figure out an actual use case for this product, plus not being able to find anything about it on the internet is making me thinking I've just made this up!

Does anyone else remember anything like this, or have I lost the plot!?

(PS - to confirm, I'm not referring to AirTags)"

"What is the purpose of making a service appointment? A week ago I made an appointment to get my battery changed. The price is being hiked in March, and my phone is a few years old still on the original battery. May as well change it before the price hike as it is noticeably weaker. (On my 6s I'd change the battery myself, but honestly I cba to replace iphone batteries myself now). 

So I made an appointment online, where I input that I was coming in for a battery replacement, the day I wanted, the store I would be at, and the type of phone I have. I even got the email & text reminder about my appointment this morning, so I drive to the Apple store, get checked in, wait for a staff member to be available, start the initial info gathering part of the process.......just to be told the store doesnt have my battery in stock, and they would have to order it and wait 3-5 business days.

What was the point of the appointment?!? They knew when I was coming in, they knew what store I was going to, they knew what type of battery I needed. Seriously, instead of a reminder email & text why couldn't I have gotten a message saying we don't have the battery yet, don't bother coming in. Why is the battery only being ordered now...AFTER I came in, not when I booked the appointment (Ya know, more than 3-5 business days ago).

The ""most innovative tech company"" can't even link their appointment schedule with the Apple stores? Not even like I was at a third party repair center, it was an official Apple store...

End rant"

"Universal control appreciation post So this is an upvote for universal control and a downvote for M2 MBA only supporting 1 external display. 

I have a personal M2 MBA and a M1 MBP that is my work machine.

Two things to know about me: 

1. I have been wanting 3 screens. Was really frustrated about the M2 MBA not supporting 2 externals. 
2. I have been trying to keep work / personal stuff separate 

Now I have a set up where the two laptops are mounted on either side of my monitor. I have 3 screens!! I also can control both personal and work with one set of mouse/keyboard which is great. 

Of course I still can't share windows across the machines, but I haven't found that to be much of an issue. I usually keep slack/spotify on one screen and do my work on the other two. 

I was pretty skeptical about universal control but I'm actually a pretty big fan of it. It works so much better than I thought it would."
"Sharpness of iMac 24"" vs Macbook Pro We got a 24"" iMac at work and I'm just amazed by the clarity of its screen? I thought it was the same PPI as the 13"" MBP  and Apple even says it's only 218PPI vs the 227 of the MacBook. Even so, when I'm comparing the iMac screen to my (2017) MBP it's definitely sharper. The difference is slight of course but I'm still wondering how it can be. Did Apple change the panels for True Tone and they appear sharper through more contrast?"

"Never ever ever get AppleCare through Best Buy Total Tech AppleCare + Best Buy=weeks of waiting

Do NOT get Best Buy Total Tech for your iPhone or, probably any apple product. These two companies need to acknowledge that the relationship isn’t working and it is at the customer’s expense. Honestly, Best Buy, he or she is not that into you, move on. And customers- neither is interested in you, you’re just in a custody battle.

On 1/3 I brought my beyond repairable iPhone into Best Buy for repair. I have Total Tech with Apple Care so it was fully covered. That all sounds good but what happens after is the most maddening b.s. 

1) The person I talked to at the Geeksquad counter looked at my phone, could see it is well beyond repair and said they could not take the phone in because I would need to make a Geeksquad appointment because they need to “run diagnostics to see if it is covered by Total Tech AppleCare”. It is. Is this something I can look up online on my account myself? He says, “Yes, you can do that.” This makes no sense then why an appointment is needed to determine that because if I can look it up (and I already had), why can’t the Geek Squad dude standing in Best Buy who has my account pulled up in his Best Buy computer not find this information himself? But I don’t want to make his life difficult because whatever they have going on for an inefficient system isn’t his fault. I ask if I can get in for that appointment that day or evening. No. It will be 3 days. Wait three days for them to look up my Apple Care. WTF. Ok, corporate bullshit has me waiting a few days.

2) 3 days later I make the time to drive back over there again with the same issue-need the phone replaced. The person at the counter this time is more helpful to the degree they can be. She is like, “I don’t know why they made you wait and make an appointment we can just do this right here.” She says she worked in the phone section but that they don’t cross train which leads to that stuff—As in being required to make an appointment to verify AppleCare coverage. And my Geeks Squad appointment says customer want to verify Apple Care coverage as my reason for the appointment. Um. NO, I DON’T, I want to move the repairs forward. I let her know that I appreciated her help and thought it seemed excessive to have to go in twice, 3 days apart just for that. She processed the phone, could see it is unrepairable and charged me for a replacement. She says it may be up to THREE WEEKS for them to replace. The phone but it does get overnight shipped both ways. Ok. So I have to use an old phone that does not get texts from almost numbers, that does not get data because my SIM is 5G and the phone is 4g. But, it’s temporary, it’ll be fine. It is, however, my work phone so I have to tell everybody that I do not get texts nor do I have data.

3) Days pass. Weeks pass. I go to AppleCare to find out what is going on. There is no record of a repair for my phone with them because they run it all through Best Buy and cut the customer out. You cannot talk to ANYONE at Apple because they have no record of your repairin their system. This leaves tracking a repair through Best Buy. When that happens it simply says, “We are moving forward with your repair’ or some unhelpful sentence like. No timeline, no deadline, no contact info. 

4) I am now 25 days in from the start of this. I decide to call the store to speak to a human. Instead it’s AI that tells me the phone attached to my number is currently in repair. OMG I KNOW THIS.  I say I want to talk to a person and AI tells me it “understands” I want to talk to someone and the wait will be 7 minutes. 5 minutes in someone answers. BUT it is clear I have been forwarded to a call center.  I explain what I want to know, they tell me they will see what is going on.  Hold. They return to tell me that my phone is being repaired.  That is so inadequate. I KNOW THIS. I want more accountability on that end- what is going on, give me a date, etc. He tells me I should call the store and would I like the number.. No- because that is where I called and got sent out to them.  

5) Today I go in to Best Buy again. They apologize and say they are unable to talk to any human being there and are only able to escalate the order and they say they have been doing it every other day and, will now, on day 24, start doing it daily. And they tell me this is typical of Apple with them.

DO NOT GET TOTALTECH for your Apple device. Pretty sure Apple deprioritizes their Best Buy work, Best Buy gets your Total Tech money so they don’t care as it is still profitable for them and you are out your device for weeks on end, with zero accountability on either company’s end. Absolute bs."

"Is there an iPhone keyboard like Android's GBoard? I switched from an Android to an iPhone and I'm happy about it. But I sorely miss GBoard on Android. I realise there's an iOS GBoard but it's much worse.

I miss being able to quickly enter numbers by long pressing the qwerty... keys. You can do this on iOS GBoard but you have to hold the keys for so long!

I also miss being able to use punctuation by long pressing other letter characters. On iOS, you have to long press the period key and then select, which is inconvenient.

Is there an iOS keyboard with these features? I swipe type, if that makes a difference."

"AirTag family sharing 🤦 I can’t believe Apple still hasn’t added family sharing to AirTags. That would be the game winner. Every other tracker on the planet has this feature, and Apple is still missing out 637 days later.

"Spouses sharing iCloud accounts Hello there reddappleiverse… My wife and I have been using the same iCloud account (my email) on all our Apple devices since 2009 mainly because that was the only way to share purchases (before family support) and share a single iCloud photo library (before iCloud Shared Photo Library). We keep our messages/FaceTime separate just by unchecking the other phone number unchecked in settings and never giving out the Apple ID email as a way to be messaged/called. We like that we can use “find my” to ding either of our devices which I do for her a few times a week. However, it has some annoyances like bugs where it shows missed calls to the other number, and messaging business chat shows up on both devices. Other than that, it generally works fine and we are used to it, but I have 2 questions for the hive mind:
1.	Does anyone else still do this? Are there some other benefits I might not be realizing?
2.	Splitting them seems like a good idea but a huge pain. Can someone talk me out of this? Anyone successfully completed a split like this?"
"Security keys, 2FA, account recovery testing I did some testing with and without security keys…

**Scenario**: 2FA enabled, Advanced Data Protection Enabled, Recovery Key set, 2 Recovery Contacts set  
   
Apple ID password reset - there are 3 options:  
1.	 You must HAVE unlocked trusted device AND must KNOW device passcode and then you can change password in settings (can be secured more by blocking Account changes with different pin) 
  

2.	You must KNOW a trusted phone number AND must HAVE unlocked trusted device to get pushed 6 digit code to reset remotely


3.	You must KNOW a trusted phone number AND must HAVE it to receive SMS verification code/call AND must KNOW your icloud recovery key
 

Logging in - there are two options:  
1.	Must KNOW password ; must HAVE unlocked trusted device
2.	Must KNOW password ; must HAVE working trusted phone number for SMS/Call
               


!!! Note I couldn't see a way to use Recovery Contacts.  Apple says having a Recovery Key set means Account Recovery is disabled, originally I thought this would just disable the manual Account Recovery that happens when you phone apple up about it - but it doesn't make it clear this means Recovery Contacts don't work. [edit] However the Recovery Key or Recovery Contacts are still very likely important for recovering end to end encryption keys for iCloud. 


___

 
**New scenario**: As above but with 2 Security Keys set as well  
 
  
Apple ID password reset - there is maybe 1 actual option:  
  
1.	You must HAVE an unlocked trusted device AND must KNOW device passcode to use settings menu to change password

2.	iforgot.apple.com - pushes a notification to your trusted devices which takes you to do #1 above...  or you can alternatively get instructions for #3. It does not apply 6 digit code etc. 

3.	Tells you to use Apple Support app etc.  When I try this currently it asks to confirm my phone number, and then takes me to a ""Security Key Verification - To reset your password, verify one of your security keys."" screen.  But this is immediately popped over with a ""Cannot verify identity - Your action could not be completed because of a server error. Try again."" message before I even have time to try to scan a key.  Maybe its suspicious because of all the fooling around I've been doing. This is where IMO it should allow you to HAVE the security key and KNOW the recovery key. 

4.	With the SAME factors as #1 you can also remove all the security keys from your account and remove the restrictions in place but this isn't really a separate option as its the same factors…
  
!!! So in this configuration, if correct, your account is GONE if a) you can't unlock a trusted device AND b) you forgot your icloud password. As above I don't feel this is correct - you should be able to HAVE a Security Key + KNOW the Recovery Key.  That said, this scenerio should be very rare?  And anybody who loses all their devices and forgets their icloud password is pretty unlikely to know their recovery key :P
  
!!!Your account is NOT lost if you lose all your security keys - see #4 above you can just delete them if you have the factors for #1  

The Recovery Key or Recovery contacts can’t seem to help you reset the password in this scenario, however they are still important to recover end to end encryption keys for iCloud data. 

  
Logging in there is only one option:  
                Must KNOW password ; must HAVE one of your security keys (or see #4 above)  
                (that said, I only tested this on icloud.com, didn't try logging in to a new device because pain but I suspect its the same...)
 
  
Google will let you have security keys plus other forms of two factor. However if you turn Google advanced protection on, then it also reverts to only allowing security keys as the second factor. But you can set a recovery contact that they warn will take several days to process."

"Is Apple mixing and matching NAND flash configurations in M2 Pro Mac Minis? So I have just watched four separate YouTube videos all reporting the same capacity with totally different SSD speeds .

I've babied it ever since I've owned it and it's in immaculate, pristine condition. I've even kept the original box and documentation. 

I put it up for auction on eBay... and the best price I could get was $750. I was also disgusted by such low ball offers I'm getting on this laptop, both on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist.

$750? What the hell? I thought Apple laptops had amazing resale value? This laptop has no dents or scratches whatsoever. I think it's worth at least $1,300. 

Is there something going on here...?"
Anyone else still sporting an AirPort router holding out for Apple to get back into the router game? The AirPort Extreme is the simplest and best-looking router I’ve ever used. Problem is that it’s pretty old. I’ve been tempted to look for a new router but I’m holding out for Apple to get back into the router game!
"Anyone Else Very Disappointed with Freeform? I was so incredibly excited for Freeform to launch because I love collaborating on projects with people for all types of things. It felt clunky to always be using different apps for different things, and I thought Freeform would be a great combination of other Apple apps (with functionality from Notes, Keynote, Numbers, etc.). 

BUT after spending this week tying to collaborate with my partner on a house we're building (layouts, floor plan, dimensions, lists, etc.) in Freeform, I find myself disappointed over how much is lacking. 

I'm hoping Apple adds a lot more power and functionality in the future. 

Primarily, I would love 

* the ability to change the dimensions of shapes (like one can do in Numbers, Keynote, Pages)
* change background color, grid, grid type, etc. 
* hold down hand-drawn lines / shapes and have them snap into the shape 
* snap hand drawn lines or shapes to the grid 
* be able to select more than just hand drawn lines 
* be able to select / move / scale / rotate / duplicate groups of objects 
* be able to lock objects 
* have an object tree sidebar 
* have settings or preferences 

Curious what thoughts you all have!"

"Does the Studio Display jelly scroll when rotated 90°? The iPad mini 6 jelly scrolls when in portrait orientation [due](https://www.notebookcheck.net/iFixit-explains-why-the-iPad-mini-6-suffers-from-jelly-scrolling.568461.0.html) to its display’s vertically mounted controller board, whereas displays with horizontally mounted controller boards like the iPad mini 5 or iPad Air would only jelly scroll when in landscape mode.

The iPad Pro also has a vertically mounted controller board but at 120hz it’s unnoticeable. 

So it would stand to reason that the Studio Display at 60hz, when rotated 90° would jelly scroll. 

Has anyone used the Studio Display in portrait orientation? If so did you notice jelly scroll?"

Do the later series have any radio improvements?"

"Apple Watch Ultra - a great watch, but a terribly-designed watch face. The minute/hour hands completely obscure Complications at certain times. I love my Apple Watch Ultra, but why did Apple think when they designed the standard watch face? There are certain times of day when I can't read my complications because of the stupid opaque minute/hour hands. The worst part is that it's such a simple fix that seems to be ignored entirely with each iteration of Apple Watch (unless I'm missing some way of changing the opacity.)"
"Heads up RE: Apple Studio Display I just bought two Apple Studio displays. I ordered them with a Mac Studio Max and an M2 Air but the computers will arrive in a few weeks and the Studio Displays are here now. I am currently using an iMac 27"" from 2017. My iMac is connected to an OWC Thunderbay4 which holds four 6TB drives. That is chained to another Thunderbay4 with 4 backup  drives. The second Thunderbay is chained to an OWC dock to which I have two fast NVME ssd's for video editing. I connected my new Apple Studio Display to the iMac's second Thunderbolt port and booted it. It was a no go for the display. Studio Displays must be connected directly to the Mac and they have only one Tbolt port (and four USB-C Gen 2 ports).  It can't be chained. Previously my iMac had a different display connected to my OWC dock but the Apple display can't do that, nor could it boot if my other port on the imac was so heavily used. It turns out (an hour and a half with Apple techs that have sent the issue to the engineers) that - apparently - the Apple Display is power intensive (in spite of it's own power cord) and can't deal with the iMac's Thunderbolt setup. The iMac shares a single controller between the two Tbolt ports. I have learned if I boot my iMac with  the display connected to one thunderbolt on my iMac and then add just one Thunderbay and after that add the other Thunderbay with the attached dock, then it's all good and stable but the display will not turn on if I boot with everything attached.  My 16"" M1 Macbook Pro Max will deal with all of this attached at the same time so I am assuming the Mac Studio Max will also since the 4 Tbolts on the Studio  are independent.    Thought I'd clue folks in so since I mistakenly assumed my Studio displays could be easily connected like my previous Eizo display was. BTW...the complaints about the Studio Display's web cam were warranted. I'll be buying a decent web cam. Just horrible. Worse than my old iMac."

"Apple should have an all Mac event To me it would seem obvious for Apple to have two stacked events a year (or every other year for Macs) with a 1st quarter event for all things Mac (Mac mini, Mac Studio, Mac Pro, iMac, MacBook, Air, Pro, and accessories like displays and other peripherals) and the 3rd quarter event for obviously everything else (iPhone, iPad, Watch, Airpods, TV, HomePod, etc.). I know there's probably a reason why they don't do that but I also find it odd whenever they release a product in a press release and not in one of there events. Or whenever certain products, like iPads, can either be released in either the first half or second half of the year instead of sticking to a specific release window.

Obviously this is just a quick rant and personal opinion but I'd like to know what everyone else thinks and if anyone knows why Apple doesn't do this."

"People in the Apple ecosystem who got rid of their Apple Watch, why? e.g. you have an iphone, ipad  and MacBook but just don't get along with the watch

 \- you switched to another type of smart watch, if so how is it better for your circumstances?

 \- you realised you didn't need one or found it too annoying, what specifically: charging hassle, it broke too easily, didn't do what you'd hoped, another 'thing' to have to manage etc

&#x200B;

I am considering getting one, but unlike a phone/laptop/computer that I've used for decades, this is an entirely new type of device, so I am interested to know why people felt it fell short enough to ditch it entirely.

For people who still have an Apple Watch and love it, great! But this is not the thread for you to comment on :D


**EDIT**: thanks everyone for all your very detailed reponses and discussions, super informative I will read them all and then decide!

**EDIT 2**: the single biggest issue for most people seems to be the battery life, so for that reason, for now, I'm out. Once they get the battery-life up to a week, then I will reconsider. Regarding the 'distractions' it's really hard to gauge as I know you can configure it and for every person who says 'it's a nightmare' another says 'game changer' as they don't have to use their phone as often. Other reasons include longevity, as other people say, for the same money you can get a watch, though functionally poorer, will last decades."
"Windows integration Hello everyone, I have a question for people who generally use Apple products (iPhones, watch, iPad, airpods, …) but for whatever reason use a Windows PC/laptop. Do you have any solutions for integration of the windows system into otherwise Apple ecosystem? I know that iMessages, FaceTime and so on are not possible but I wonder if there are any solutions for having iCloud share to your computer, alternatives for features such as airdrop, perhaps some software to autoconnect airpods while sound is playing and so on."
"3rd Party Touch ID Keyboards Does Apple have a patent, profit-driven restriction, or security-driven restriction on Touch ID keyboards that work with Mac? I can’t seem to find any. A solid quarter to half the cost of a new Mac mini these days is the stinking “full featured” keyboard with a numerical pad and a Touch ID technology that’s decades old. Does it need to be like this?"
"World wide returns does not seem to exist Bought an Apple Watch ultra abroad (USA) asked if it would work at home (EU) was told it would work and worst case my right to return was world wide. Came home, setup the watch, realised cellular was not working. Went to my local Apple Store to figure it out, they told me US sold watched some not work in Europe and I could not return an item bought in a different currency.

It makes sense but it’s still frustrating, part of why so buy so much from the Apple Store is the great customer experience, you trust that they will give you accurate information."

"What's connected to your Mac? I've outgrown my iMac due to 4K video. I'm going to consolidate some smaller SSD/NVMEs into other  enclosures to cut down on all the connected drives I have.  As I was struggling to decide what to toss out (any 512GB SSD) and how to organize my external drives I just had to shake my head when I looked at my setup. My main external is an OWC 4 bay with each bay holding 6TB drives and that is backed up to another OWC 4 bay. Some of the drives are partitioned which is why my list of drives looks so insane. Here's a screenshot of my drives/partitions. If you have a bunch of drives connected as many of us do, let's see yours and give us a total.

I have some questions now that iOS 16.3 is out.

Is the Home architecture fixed? I can’t find any information that it is fixed, but I’m not good at finding all the information about iOS updates. Siri is still having problems with some questions and sometimes it’s quite laggy with the HomePod Mini. 

Is 16.2 the latest update on HomePod Mini? My HomePod Mini is on 16.2, and I can’t see any new updates on it. 
I heard that they would enable the humidity and temperature sensors in this update. Should I force update via my Mac?

"A lesson learned. Avoid buying any secondhand Airpods. To start, I will say I'm very tech savvy. Today I went to buy some Airpods pro gen 2 that i found listed on offer up BNIB. I stressed to the seller that I wanted to verify the authenticity before I handed over the money. Trust me when I say, these are the best fakes I have ever seen. I checked the serial number on the apple coverage website and it was all green. I connected them to my phone and all the settings that should pop up were there. Every single serial number matched; the box, the case, the individual airpods, and even in the settings app. They even had applecare+ until 2025. These things had me fooled for a solid 4 hours, until I turned on transparency mode. I could tell something was off. I went to the apple store and 3 techs were stumped with the authenticity since it even registered on their diagnostics tools and showed a valid SN. The main tell was the font was ever so slightly off on the inside of the lid and the weight of the counterfeit pods were slightly lighter than authentic. Moral of the story, do not buy airpods on third party marketplaces unless the seller is willing you meet you at apple and let a tech or two take a look at them.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Fake Airpods are getting almost indistinguishable from the real thing. If buying secondhand or from a third party marketplace, do not trust anyone not willing to meet you at an apple store.


EDIT: I remember why I unsubscribed from this god awful high and mighty sub. Acting like y’all never made a mistake, awful people. I can also guarantee I’m more tech literate than any of you negative commenters. I 3d modeled and constructed a dual pc system inside a custom built desk. I’ve built my own 3d printer. I install all my own tech, including a wireless CarPlay unit. I’ve wired and built my own digital soldering iron. I run my own home media plex server that also doubles as a ubiquiti home security server. Fuck all y’all “I guess the bar for tech savvy is low these days”

EDIT 2: BNIB literally means brand new in box. I opened them in front of the seller. They were not used in the slightest"

"How often do you upgrade your apple devices? I acquired almost all apple devices in the ecosystem because I sold my MacBook air 2019 for a custom PC, and now I have the AirPods pro 2, Apple watch series 8, iPhone 11, and iPad 8th gen. I was wondering how often you would upgrade each of your devices. since the AirPods and Apple Watch are still new to me I plan to use them until their lifespan or if they ever if it break down. I still have my 11 which I got as a hand-me-down in 2020 but I don't feel like upgrading right away since it's still good at 85% battery health. as for the iPad I would probably wait till the A12 slow down or if I have to wait for a large upgrade for it. I asked this question mainly because I see people really upgrading their iPhones every year or 2 years from a phone plan but I was wondering I often they upgrade their other apple devices considering if they're part of the ecosystem as well."

"NEW 2023 - iCloud Won't Allow Your 4k UHD HDR RAW Video Files To Be Downloaded Rumour has gotten out that iCloud has has a secret, but huge, downgrade.

You no longer can select an option to download your content (specifically 4k UHD) video and get all the features. 

If you download direct from the website you may notice all your videos are now in 720p, a huge downgrade from the RAW data of 2160p.

A work around is to download the iCloud desktop app and let it completely fill your local storage with your library.

This now means the videos download will be in 4k UHD and 60fps. However will lack HDR data from the file. 

I downloaded the same file about 2 months apart and, despite being intrigued by the apparent change to high efficiency, the file is missing additional content. These are the tags for the same file.

"[Rant] Customer Service hung up on me when faced with a difficult issue - twice I’m curious if anyone has come across a similar situation recently, and if anyone has advice to not run into this issue moving forward. 

A couple days ago my phone (iPhone 12 mini) stopped being able to connect with Wi-Fi. Add to that cell towers in my area going down, my phone had no way to connect with the outside world. Using my partners phone, I called Apple Care to try and diagnose the issue. The rep’s first suggestion was to reset and reinstall the iOS. I asked multiple times if this would wipe my phone. I would have to back it up properly first if so, as I can’t lose valuable information on there. 

She emphatically said multiple times it would not. Lo and behold, it did. As soon as I mentioned this, and was quite unhappy as we had directly discussed this, she stopped speaking. The line was open, I could hear ambient noise for about 3 minutes, then she hung up. I later found out she made no notes on the case either. 

Just today, I had to call again about an issue with some Apple software on my computer. It’s my primary work software, and the issue I was dealing with is very complex. After spending about 30 minutes on the phone with support, realizing we were going in circles and he wasn’t going to be able to help, I asked to speak with a supervisor or someone who might have more knowledge on such a niche (but very important) issue. 

Similar to the first call, he went silent for a couple minutes, then hung up. I again found out in a subsequent call he didn’t take any notes about the call. 

Has this happened with anyone else? Very unhappy with this lack of professionalism and accountability."
"Netflix is missing quite a few features on Apple TV Title, I'm sure I can't be the only one who's noticed this.

Not only are we stuck with the old landscape tile design, but we're missing:

\- Notifications (including the ability to see what is coming soon)

\- Collections

\- Top 10 trending

\- No way to remove from Continue Watching

\- A way to remote control? This is possible across every other TV device I use and isn't limited to Google Cast, as Xbox & Playstation both show in the ""Casting"" menu (Likely using Netflix Remote Control)

&#x200B;

I understand these may be minor features, but the fact that even the UI looks super dated compared to the other platforms just raises so many questions for me. You're paying the same price as everyone else, and being punished for choosing to use the service on the Apple TV.

The app was last updated on January 11, 2023 so it's not like it isn't being maintained. They're deliberately holding features back from Apple TV users. How is this okay?"
"Apple iPhone 14 Pro's 'Fastest 5G Phone in America' title replaced by Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Pixel 7 Pro Ookla released its mobile performance report for the fourth quarter of 2022. In the US market, the iPhone 14 Pro 's title of ""fastest 5G mobile phone"" has changed hands, **being replaced by Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Google's The Pixel 7 Pro catches up.**   


The median download of the iPhone 14 Pro Max was 133.84 Mbps; the median download of the iPhone 14 Pro was 130.14 Mbps, ranking third and fourth respectively."
"All Apple needs to do is make the iPad Pro into a MacOS closed system and voila. All Apple needs to do is make the iPad Pro into a MacOS closed system and voila. And keep their MacBooks as open.

People who want to multitask like a pro on a touch device will actually be tempted by the openness of the MacBook and might get one. And MacBook users might be tempted by the portability of the ipad and get one, even tho they might not get the full experience, most wouldn’t “replace” one with the other.

edit: I'm by no means speaking in favor of the community first. I'm speaking in favor of the, unfortinately, evil corporation that needs to please shareholders and sell tons of devices first, then to the community. And as shitty as it sounds, I think it's actually a great deal that we could get an improved iPadOS UX and UI, along with some tweaks, and let us run most of mac app store apps, just like macos runs iPad apps. That would be enough for me to save for an iPad Pro."

"I wanted to use OpenAI's Whisper speech-to-text on my Mac without installing stuff in the Terminal so I made MacWhisper, a free Mac app to transcribe audio and video files for easy transcription and subtitle generation. Would love to hear some feedback on it! When OpenAI released Whisper last year ([https://openai.com/blog/whisper/](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/)) I was blown away by how good it was at speech to text. Rap songs, low quality recordings, multi language conversations, everything seemed to work really well! Unfortunately the setup process required you to install a bunch of dependencies to then have to use Terminal for transcribing audio. Last week I made a very easy to use Mac app to solve this, MacWhisper!

Quickly and easily transcribe audio files into text with OpenAI's state-of-the-art transcription technology Whisper. Whether you're recording a meeting, lecture, or other important audio, MacWhisper quickly and accurately transcribes your audio files into text.

**Features**

* Easily record and transcribe audio files
* Just drag and drop audio files to get a transcription
* Get accurate text transcriptions in seconds (\~15x realtime)
* Search the entire transcript and highlight words
* Supports multiple languages (fastest model is English only)
* Copy the entire transcript or individual sections
* Supports Tiny (English only), Base and Large models
* Reader Mode
* Edit and delete segments from the transcript
* Select transcription language (or use auto detect)
* Supported formats: mp3, wav, m4a and mp4 videos.
* .srt & .vtt export

**Which version do you need?**

You can download MacWhisper or MacWhisper Pro. MacWhisper Pro includes the Large model which offers the best transcription available right now and has industry leading accuracy but takes a lot longer to generate. The regular version of MacWhisper uses the Tiny (English only) and Base models, which are still very accurate and fast. Depending on your usecase you might want to use the Pro version. You can always change what version you want later.

Gumroad has a 250MB file size limit for apps that are listed for free so I had to make that part paid. Select **MacWhisper Pro** from the sidebar and pay 6 or more to get it.

Report: Apple not actively developing a new HomePod mini ;
Dear Apple: don't forget the iMac again pls [Luke Miani] ;
Gurman: Apple prepping 'major iPad Pro revamp' for next year ;
"""Dark patterns"" on Trade-in site OMG I wish I'd checked here before my recent iPhone upgrade purchase.  But Apple generally has such great service I never dreamed they would screw me over like this.

I purchased online to replace my wife's phone, because NO DEALER in my area had what I wanted in stock. Got the new phone fine.  And the trade-in process initially seemed excellent - estimated $160 for a 4 generations old phone, sent me a prepaid return box, all good.

Then I get the ""revised value"" and it's $55 not $160.  No way I'm taking that, but they will send the phone back to me no charge.

Here's where it gets ""dark"" though.  I *accidentally* clicked the ""Accept"" button instead of ""Reject"".  There is no ""are you sure?"" confirmation.  Just ""Thank you, you've accepted the offer"".   No recourse, nothing.

I *immediately* went to Support.  Online customer service can't help, but they take all my information and suggest I try the phone support line.  The phone support person is very nice, but even they CANNOT REVERSE THE PROCESS. 

This is deliberately predatory design, first at the UI level, and second at the business process level."
"Why isn’t a microphone referenced anywhere on Apple Sing? Am I supposed to pretend? I can adjust the volume of the vocals on songs. But am I supposed to hear my voice in my speakers through Apple TV? Am I supposed to pretend? What’s the point?

A regrets buying Studio Max and not wait for Mini? With the powerful M2 Mac Mini Pro out do you have any regrets buying a Mac Studio if you’re not using it for intense video editing? I could’ve saved a bundle waiting.
"User Feedback Why doesn’t Apple take user feedback seriously? 

Let’s take Siri for example. People have been sharing their experiences and feedback for years yet the product is generally not much better than it was on release. Sure it received a more fluid voice. But as far as its functionality it’s highly inaccurate. 

Having to tell Siri to go away every time it’s used is simply unintuitive. The phrases it uses are immature at best. For example it will say “Uhh hu?” if you don’t speak fast enough. What in the California!?

Siri is has become the substandard of Virtual Assistants. Even pop culture continually rags on it.

Apple seems to care so little that it’s not even listed on the Product Feedback page.
https://www.apple.com/feedback/

Are they afraid of criticism? Do they just not like their user base? Or are they simply smug?
 
I’m assuming the latter considering they call their employees Geniuses.

p.s. This was deleted from their user forum because it’s “not constructive”. So maybe they are just afraid of criticism."

It would certainly be better for the environment and consumers. What is stopping this from happening? Corporate greed?"

If that destination has no service - you're stuck.

"Siri on Apple TV vs iOS I’ve been seeing so many “is Siri getting dumber” posts. I agree that this is a concern, a big time one as many use digital assistants for the day to day. I am wondering if, at least partially, it’s because Apple tries to keep a large amount of its operations on the phone itself as opposed to using the cloud exclusively, as well as not getting as much analytical data from users to improve the system. 

I know Apple was caught a while back listening and keeping peoples audio without their consent, and I’m wondering if they were trying to get more data to improve Siri, much like maybe Alexa and Google do/did?

Has anyone else realized that Siri on Apple TV is faster and much better than on the iPhone, at least for me? It’s actually a pleasure to use the Siri Remote compared to Siri on the iPhone. I wonder if the Apple TV actually uses customer data to improve Siri (at least for Apple TV). I can’t speak to the HomePod because I have not yet used one.

Anyone agree with this at some level? Or do you have any other things to add to this topic?"

"Dropbox forcing ""Files On-Demand"" cloud storage instead of local storage I use Dropbox to sync my files between a few devices. Notably, I want all of the files to remain on all of the devices.

This weekend, I was presented with a message from my Dropbox client that it wants to move all of my locally stored files from ~/Dropbox to ~/Library/CloudStorage. This is a huge pain in the ass, as it will require updating about a hundred configuration files to point to the new path.

Much more disturbing, the new Dropbox client indicates that all files will be marked as ""On-Demand,"" *i.e.*, potentially not living on my devices but only in Dropbox. This is alarming, since many of my workflows expect files to be available locally and to be immediately available, rather than waiting to be downloaded from Dropbox. It also raises the ugly prospect of discovering that needed files are inaccessible when I'm offline, and being unable to access them (or, at least, without a lengthy delay).

Some research revealed [this article from Microsoft last year](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-disk-space-with-onedrive-files-on-demand-for-mac-529f6d53-e572-4922-a585-e7a318c135f0#:~:text=OneDrive%20Files%20On%2DDemand%20helps,new%20information%20about%20each%20file.) regarding similar changes in OneDrive, and, further, that these changes appear to have been prompted by Apple deprecating some kexts that OneDrive had used for syncing cloud storage files. I also found [this MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/01/onedrive-mac-users-unhappy-files-on-demand/) suggesting that OneDrive users hate this change and find it to be buggy.

I'm extremely irritated by this change, as **I never have and never will rely on on-demand cloud storage for these files**. These files are core to my daily digital life and I expect them to be available all the time on every device and kept fully in sync. I have plenty of local storage space for these files and I am accustomed to managing all of it. So these changes, which not only break current workflows but might introduce new and persistent headaches, are motivated by features that aren't even relevant to me.

I am so deeply irritated by this bullshit that I am now looking at other cloud storage providers that won't engage in this kind of behavior. If I have to blow an entire weekend reconfiguring my machines due to the ghoulish demands of Dropbox, I may as well switch to a provider that is actually sensitive to users' needs.

Recommendations are welcome."
"Why doesn't Apple specify NAND flash SSD configuration/speed Why doesn't Apple clarify the speed of the SSDs that come in their computers? I feel it is a bit shady that we don't really know what we're buying.

The M2 MacBook Pro has now famously shipped with a single NAND flash for the 256GB model meaning it is half the speed of the 256GB SSD in the original M1 MacBook Air unless you buy a 512GB model.

I have heard that now with the M2 Mac Mini, you won't get a dual NAND configuration until the 2TB model.

If Apple won't give all devices a dual NAND config (2x128GB, 2x256GB, 2x512GB) I feel like they should at least specify the rated SSD speed of the device.

When you buy an SSD online you don't just cross your fingers and hope your getting a fast one."

"What’s the difference between Apple Notes and Apple Quick Notes? What’s the difference between Apple Notes and Apple Quick Notes?

I understand that Quick Notes are stored in Notes but why not just send to Notes vs send to Quick Notes.

Even when it comes to the Control Center Controls, there is a Notes control and a Quick Notes control. 

Can’t find the answer anywhere. Searching just compares Apple Notes to OneNote and other completing applications."
"Can we get multi-monitor support? Like great UX instead of random support? So I love display tech and I’m a software engineer. So every year I’m swapping out for a hopefully improved experience. 

I run two MacBook pros and they share a dual monitor setup. So I’m intimately experiencing MacOS display support.

I’m seeing an abysmal experience with this setup. 

Whenever I switch inputs the MacBook never remembers the monitor arrangement and it must be manually set.

When inputs are switched from monitors the other MacBook is still “using” the monitors. Meaning that open applications are invisible. The mouse can scroll over to the right or left into invisible monitors which are no longer displaying this computer’s displays yet they still are shown to the OS. 

Can we get these issues fixed and create a premium experience for monitors?"
"I was today years old when I learned how warranty exchanges work with Apple Edit: I was at the \~2 hours away Apple store to pick up an order, and in the area to visit family. I brought the defective MagSafe Duo with me to exchange, having checked to confirm the store had stock. I did not mean to give the impression that I drove there *only* to exchange the MagSafe Duo. I did not do my homework. No excuses for that. In my weak defence, I've never had to do homework on Apple's processes before because they are typically so slick and seamless. I was just surprised I could not simply exchange the defective item for in-store stock, something that I would take for granted at Best Buy, Home Depot, or in a purely online environment, Amazon.

Edit 2: Sounds like there may have been a break down in the process at the Apple store. Other people have reported different experiences in similar circumstances. E.g., they should have agreed to mail the device to me.

Mini-rant. Drove the \~2 hours to my nearest Apple store to exchange my MagSafe Duo charger, the phone-side charger of which stopped working a couple weeks ago. The unit was still under warranty. Despite a dozen or so MagSafe chargers SITTING RIGHT THERE ON THE SHELF they could not give me one.

>""Those ones are for sale.""

Had to wait for a Genius bar appointment. To submit my request. To have Apple ship a replacement unit. Back to the same store. The one that is \~2 hours away. They'll let me know when it arrives.

Hands down one of the most Monty Python / Seinfeld / Curb Your Enthusiam skit worthy experiences I have ever had. Hours later I am still thoroughly flabergasted.

Inconceivable."

"Apple meets Parenting - what non-OS apps do you use for content blocking / parental controls? I'm throwing the question out there to see if anyone has recommendations for parental controls like tools, on an admin account. 

My 13 year old has his own computer, and frequently needs to be able to use admin privileges for school (thanks Discord for constantly changing servers). 

He wants to update to an admin account, which we are fine with, but we also want to be able to watch and limit some adult content.  Anyone come up with something interesting? 

  
The best option I see is turning on Screen Time and limit Adult websites but I'm looking for something that can also help monitor. Years ago, I knew of an app called K9 that did it, but it got bought up and shut down.   


Thanks!"
"DaVinci Resolve 18 Lag on M1 Max I'm not quite sure if it is a RAM issue or a lack of graphics optimization via Metal or the cores within the chips, but while editing in DaVinci Resolve 18, (I have a 16inch M1 Max with 32GB of RAM) the minute I add a few Fusion effects or color grading nodes to some of the clips/footage, it brings my new MacBook Pro to it's knees. Other than that, it can edit any kind of 4K footage/codec with a breeze. Anyone else noticing this? Because I wonder if these new high-end M2 models will help alleviate this issue."

"PSA: iCloud Advanced Protection can be enabled with OpenCore Legacy devices Just for anyone who's keen to turn on iCloud Advanced Protection on their account, when I first tried to enable it I had 3 devices that needed to be updated before it could be enabled, and my Mac Mini (late 2012) with an error saying that the device couldn't be updated to the latest OS and and had to be removed from my Apple ID before I could enable it.

What worked was updating the other devices, and then restarting the Mac Mini once it was on the latest Venture update and then it wasn't a problem!

Just wanted to make people aware so they didn't end up removing Apple devices when they don't need!"
"Apple ID Issues Hi all, very long post, TL;DR at bottom. 

On November 24th of 2022 I was sitting down with my family to watch the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving Special on AppleTV. I logged into Apple TV in browser on my windows machine (which is hooked up to the “TV”). It said I’d receive a prompt to authenticate with my iPhone. 

On my iPhone I received a prompt that someone in <a major city within a (long) days drive of me> was trying to access my account. Now, I know these things don’t always tell you the city you actually live in, especially when it’s actually pretty rural, so I assumed this was myself and hit Accept. It then gave me a 6 digit pin to put in on Apple TV website, which I did, and we watched the show. 

Later that evening I found out while checking my email that my Apple ID password had been reset. I realized I may have accidentally authenticated someone that wasn’t supposed to have access to the account, so I quickly attempted to reset my password thru the Settings app on my iPhone. I was told my Apple ID was locked for security reasons, and to visit iForgot.Apple.com to reset the password. 

On this website it asked for my Apple ID email and associated phone number, which I provided. Fortunately, it seems the phone number hadn’t yet been changed because it seemed to work. I was told I’d receive a text in 24 hours to reset my password.  I was like “ok that’s not ideal, but I can work with that. I’d rather not loose my account.”

Now, for background reference, I am a student right now. I do have a part time job that pays ok, but the economy has been real shitty lately, so I have taken up DoorDash and Uber to try to keep putting money into savings for my future. 

Aside from the aforementioned windows machine, my only other devices are an old MacBook Pro, and an iPad Mini (I believe 2nd generation but I don’t know for sure, it was a gift). I require both of these devices to do my schoolwork. 

Anyways, back to iForgot, after the 24 hour waiting period, I didn’t receive any text or email or anything, but I went back to the website and they told me I’d need to wait something like 2 weeks (13 days or so) to reset my password. At this point I was miffed. My income and my grades were dependent on having my devices functioning, but given the point in the semester I sucked it up and said “ok, fine. Small price to pay for not loosing my accounts right? I’ll just not by any more Christmas presents, and work out some plea deals with my professors.” 

A couple days into this two week period, I log into IForgot to check the status, and it says I can reset my password on my Mac. I’m thinking this is great, way faster than the 2 weeks I was expecting. I open up my MacBook and wait for the notification to pop up. It never does. I try running the iForgot steps again (account email, phone number, etc) and still nothing on my Mac. The iForgot website says I should be receiving a notification, but it never arrives. 

I tried again to tell it I needed to reset my password and it threw me into another 24 hour waiting period. I waited thru this period, where I was told I’d receive a message after 24 hours to reset my password. No such message arrived, and logging into iForgot again, it told me I needed to wait another two weeks.  I should also add that on this screen it says that “Apple Support cannot shorten the wait time.” So now I’m pretty frustrated, but I don’t see what else I can do but wait. 

Guess what? A couple days later iForgot has the same message about resetting my password on my Mac, and repeats the above, I log in, receive no notifications, and the iForgot countdown timer is gone again. 

So I call up Apple Support at this point because clearly something is going wrong. The first tech I speak with tells me that I need to shut down and leave powered down any devices except the one I want to reset the password with. Now I will note, NOWHERE on the iForgot website does it tell you this, but according to the tech support guy, if the system sees my other devices logged in, it’ll kick me out of the reset process. 

He has me try a couple other methods of reset on each of my devices, none of them working or course. At the end he tells me I’m just gonna have to wait for the password reset program on iForgot to run its course. He closes my ticket and, a couple days later (after finals and stuff) I attempt, again, to reset my password. 

This time I turned off all my Apple Devices, save my phone, which the Apple Support Tech *assured* me was allowed to stay on. 

At this point I think you can guess how this went. 24 hour waiting period with the promise of a text or email. No such text or email. 2 week waiting period, which after a couple days, tells me to use my Mac to reset the password, I try, but never receive any notification on my Mac. 

At this point I’m into Christmas break, and have had no access to my account for nearly a month. I called Apple Support again, and was asked to try basically all of the above again. Then they passed me up the chain to a “Senior Support Tech” or something like that. This woman, I forget her name, was very kind and understanding, but not at all helpful. She asked me to walk her through everything we tried, and had me try a couple other things (like resetting thru a friends iPhone using the Apple Support App) all to no avail. After several hours on the phone, she tells me it could be an issue with the iForgot security system, but to figure out what it could be we’d need to run another attempt at password reset with the iForgot system. She tells me that I may not receive anything at 24 hours, even tho I should, but to check it every day, and to use an emailed hyperlink to get in touch with her as soon as I notice the iForgot system has kicked me out of the reset process. 

So we start the process again, and low and behold, 24 hours, no notifications, two weeks hold, and a couple days in it tells me to use my Mac to reset (the Mac that has been powered off for nearly two weeks at this point, along with my iPad).  As soon as this happens, I open up my email to get in touch with the senior support lady, and lo and behold, the hyperlink she gave me to get in contact requires me to log in with my Apple ID to function. The Apple ID that is currently locked for security reasons. 

So seeing no other option, I called back apple support *again* and was put thru all the above paces again, was handed off to a new senior support guy named something like Dave or David or something, and he tells me all the same things, has me try all the same things as Nice Support Staff Lady, although he’s very grouchy the entire time. 

I think you can guess at this point. 24 Hours. Two Weeks. A couple days later I’m booted from the reset. Dave only provided the email link that requires Apple ID to get in touch. I call Apple Support again, walk the first guy through it again, and am passed up the chain again, this time to a guy named Ralph or something like that. 

I should also interject here, that during this entire time I have not been able to do most of the work I normally do to bring in my income, because DoorDash and Uber have had app updates that are required, but I cannot update, because my Apple ID is locked. So not only am I out my account, and all of its purchases, I’m also out one of my primary income streams now too, and at this point it’s after Christmas. I have been locked out for over a month and unable to do anything about it. 

Ralph tells me that it’s possible there is some other problem going on that is unforeseen. He asks me to try the iForgot process again, and to let him know when it kicks me out again. And THANK GOD when I bring up that the hyperlink apple support thing won’t work because my Apple ID is locked, he says, “Oh good point, I’ll give you an email you can respond to via email, as well as my office hours.” 

Over New Year’s Eve weekend, we try again, 24 hours, two weeks, kicked out, I send him an email, wait a couple days and get a call. He tells me that it’s possible there’s some other devices out there that are logged in with my Apple ID that are booting me from the process. I think about it for a while and am fairly certain that I’ve done my due diligence and that none of my friends or family had my Apple ID logged in. 

He says it can even be things I wouldn’t think about like a watch or Apple TV. I hadn’t thought of the Apple TV before, but my parents (who live two times zones away) have an Apple TV. Ralph says he’s going to escalate my case to the Apple Engineers to hopefully get this sorted out. 

I call my mom, she double checks the Apple TV, and I am not logged in on it. Haven’t been for “months or years” according to her. My dad verifies as well a few days later. I let Ralph know this by email, he says thanks and that he’s still waiting to hear from the engineers. A couple days go by and what I get back from Ralph and the engineers is basically, “Oh yeah it looks like one of your devices was still active and is getting you kicked out, but for security reasons we can’t tell you which one. Better double check them all and try again.” 

At this point by the tone of, and increasing time between, Ralph’s emails I can tell he is getting exasperated by me and or my case. I am also pretty much hopeless at this point. I have had my iPad and MacBook powered off all year, all my friends and family have confirmed not a single device is logged in with my Apple ID, which should leave just my 3: iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro. The last two of which *have been off all year*. 

Ralph has me try the iForgot system again (resetting thru the Settings app on my phone), and as I am sure you know to expect at this point: 24 hours. Two weeks. Use your Mac. No notifications. Booted out of the system again. 

At some point in the last 2 ish weeks I asked Ralph what would happen if someone had compromised the account and actually gotten a device logged in and set up with my ID. He said, in a nutshell, “well that would suck, you’d have to wait for them to stop using your Apple ID. Cuz any time you try the reset process, If anyone is using or even has powered on a device with your Apple ID logged in on it, it’s going to kick you out of the reset process. Which is unfortunate, but there is nothing I can do about that.” 

The last I heard from Ralph at this point is the message about my devices “not all being logged off and I should please double check” (they have all been off since before new years). That email was a week ago and I’m beginning to wonder if there’s nothing that can be done for my account. 

I am nearing the 2 month mark since this whole ordeal began, and I’m pretty hopeless. I have had to take extra shifts at work to make up some of the lost income from not being able to Dash and Uber, and I haven’t had access to any of my music or movies that I had spent years accumulating. Apple Support has been completely unhelpful. I don’t know what to do at this point. 

Is there anyone who’s experienced similar issues? Is there any way for me to ever get my account back? I’d take any and all suggestions at this point. 

Thanks for your time. 

TL;DR, Apple ID was probably compromised back in November and the password reset has been failing for 2 months straight. Apple Support has been completely useless and not helped anything."

"Are there any actual uses for Neural Engine on the desktop Apple first designed their own silicon for their phones. Now they are putting these chips in all their devices.

They promote their “Neural Engine” in every product launch but… is that part of the CPU ACTUALLY USED for anything on the desktop?

There was a thread on this topic a year ago. It was basically a list of things it COULD BE used for, mentions of Photoshop/FinalCut and references to faceID on phones.

As a desktop user, this feature seems like potential more than product. A larger GPU seems more useful for me personally but Im curious if I am missing something that has actually been implemented.

If there are no uses, I wish they would stop talking about it. If they are going to promote it so much, they ought to better explain what it actually does.

Ive seen some comments on using these cores for ML projects but Ive heard that the ML libraries for MacOS are way behind other platforms which use GPU’s or dedicated AI hardware. This is probably a different discussion. Normal consumers are not running ML models on their iMac."

Across my two latest iPhones I've had the same problem: bluetooth is inconsistent and takes time to properly connect to airpods or other BT headsets. This causes a lot of annoyance as I receive phone calls a lot through work and it's rather the exception that bluetooth is connected before the call times out. Connecting while in call is a nightmare. I thought perhaps I was a bit unlucky, as googling this problem didn't provide much valuable information.

But my friend moved from Android to iOS one month ago and he complained about bluetooth connectivity constantly failing on him. 

I feel this is particularly bad given that the airpods should be seamlessly integrated with the Apple devices, yet these too fail in rapidly connecting to it's host device.

Is this something common or are we both just unlucky?"

"Why do old iPhone and iPads have storage engraved on their shell? Like in here: https://imgur.com/a/hSO4E5s

It's somewhat interesting to me that a company which doesn't promotes technical specification in their ads and doesn't like putting (processor) sticker on their MacBooks, writes storage capacity.

One might think iPad comes in various models, ususally depicted and differentiated by the storage capacity they hold. But iPad could also have cellular capability which they don't mention."

"Did Apple just stop proxying certain sites through iCloud Private Relay? After the iPadOS 16.2 update was released in December 2022, I’ve noticed that when visiting some sites on my iPads, the ""Show/Hide IP address"" option would disappear, and the website notably takes a different time to load (it's usually faster compared to other websites). This started with [Apple.com](https://Apple.com),  and now expanded to the following:

[twitter.com](https://twitter.com)

[web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com)

\*.youtube.com

On more than 7 occasions now, in recent weeks, I have marked my 8am medications as “Taken” at 7:55am or thereabouts (ie just earlier than 8am), and have then been alerted at 8am by the other device to take my 8am medications. All devices connected to a network, usually Wifi, and otherwise working fine. Apple Watch is also cellular.

This is a recent trend. Didn’t happen a few weeks ago.

This is dangerous, as overdoses of some prescription medications can be severe."

I'm not telling you to turn off this safety setting, but I urge you to consider when it will and won't be helpful to you. ;)

Crash detection is on by default on all iPhone 14's, and Apple watch series 8, Ultra, and 2nd generation SE. The feature may be rolled out for older phones and watches as well with software updates. In addition to calling 911 after detecting a crash (or ""crash""), it may notify your emergency contacts by text message including live updates with your GPS location, depending on your settings.

This setting can be enabled/disabled by going to Settings -> Emergency SOS -> Call after severe crash

Thank you for your consideration!"
"Who misses the Apple Watch Edition (Titanium version that was replaced by the current AW ultra)? I have a Apple Watch Series 6 edition for over 2 years and its the best $1k i have ever spent with it being the only apple device i have not filed a apple care + claim on. It’s the titanium version in which i really enjoyed. I beat the living crap out of this thing and its still going strong, while appearing indistinguishable from the basic Apple Watch. It also actually looks good on my wrist. Recently i learned that the Apple Watch Edition was discontinued in favor of the Apple Watch ultra. I was actually pretty pissed considering that I don’t need everything that the ultra has to offer, but yet if i want to upgrade in the future I actually will have to chose between the ultra or the stainless steel. Better yet it appears too big for my wrist.

For those who owned/owns an Apple Watch Edition. What would be your plan should time come that you would be due for a upgrade? 

Go back to traditional watches? Get the ultra? Downgrade to Stainless Steel version? Or go watch less?

What are your thoughts on the product change?"

"PDFgear for Mac - An Easy and Free PDF Program Hi everyone. I’m Gordon, the developer of [PDFgear](https://www.pdfgear.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post20230116), which could handle PDFs with easier operations on Mac for free. I’ve tried most of the popular PDF programs on the market and found that either the prices are too high, the interfaces are too complicated to use, or converters not supported. So I started to create my own project to process PDF documents, and here PDFgear comes. 

PDFgear is an easy and free program, and most of the functions needed in PDFs are included:

* View PDFs for sure
* Annotate PDFs with highlight, underline, and strikethrough with customized color
* Write or draw on PDFs freely
* Insert shapes at the place you want
* Add notes and text boxes
* Fill out forms with complete tools, including text insert, checkmark, cross mark, radio button
* Sign and stamp PDFs easily
* Insert, extract, delete, crop, and rotate pages in easy steps
* Convert PDF to Word, Excel, PNG, JPEG, RTF, TXT HTML, and XML with OCR! for totally free!
* Convert Word, Excel, PPT, Image, RTF, and TXT to PDF in seconds! Also for totally free!
* Merge, split, and compress PDFs, batch supported!

You could download [PDFgear](https://www.pdfgear.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post20230116) here.

As a free program, some users might be interested in how to make money with PDFgear. Intending to bring PDFgear to more users and help handle PDFs easier, monetization is off the table for now. As for the future, some of the advanced features might be charged. But that’s just a hypothetical consideration, and I’m focusing on developing PDFgear as a better solution for PDF processing at the current stage. So I wish to get your feedback no matter it is a suggestion or a compliment!

Thanks in advance!"

"It's just not fair. [App Store reviews] I am outraged by the fact that Apple only shows app ratings and reviews in the App Store by region.

When I want to read people's reviews about this or that application, I often come across the ""no one left reviews and ratings, so we won't show you anything at all"" situation.

https://imgur.com/h6cK7gi

I moved to a country that apparently has few people with iPhones or few people who are interested in well-known applications.

OK. Why doesn't App Store have country/language filters? I want to know what people write all over the world but I don't have that opportunity.

In Steam, for example, very conveniently implemented filters by language and all information is available. Few reviews in your native language? You can see reviews from people all over the world! And decide whether to buy the game or not.

This is sorely lacking in the app store and I feel it's unfair that the company doesn't allow me to learn more about the app through reviews and ratings from users around the world."
"Can we please have better filtering and sorting in the App Store? There are so many results I get back, I wish I could sort by rating and popularity, filter by Category, Paid / Free, Ads / Ad-Free, Subscription vs One Time Fee, filter by annual cost. Right now I do all this manually and it’s exhausting to find the app I’m actually looking for."
"Refurb Mac Studio ""lost"" in transit to Apple Store - Where/how do I escalate this? TL;DR - UPS has a proof of delivery of a refurb Mac Studio to an Apple Store, Apple Store says they don't have it. I'm feeling stuck between the finger-pointing (Apple says file a claim with UPS), and need suggestions on how to escalate as I simply want the Mac Studio I ordered. What should I do now?

**Update**
* First thank you to everyone who replied! Today the unit was found somewhere in/about/near the retail store. 
* I had escalated on both fronts including a claim with UPS that rejected it with ""contact sender first and create a SEM case"" + Apple Number
* The retail store implied the problem occurred because I ""changed my ship-to address to that the retail store"" which was certainly not the case - I just selected the ship-to-store option/process. That said, my name appeared above ""Apple Pacific Centre"" in the shipping address, but I have no idea why they fumbled/lost it. 
* I suspect the fact this unit was a refurbishment and shipped from Elk Grove California it may have gotten some manual attention. Through this journey I've learned more of the process than I cared for, but do want to send my appreciation to Ryan at the Vancouver retail store for being kind/professional and helpful throughout.

----------
Details:
I ordered a Mac Studio refurb G14K6LL and chose “in-store pickup” to be safe. A day later I received an invoice/shipped notice and my CC was charged - all seemed well. 

Late the day of supposed pick-up (Friday 13th), I called Apple and was told ""it's at the store"" and noted that I've not received a pickup notice. They transferred me to the store and was told ""no we don't have it in the POS, but call back tomorrow after 10am"". 

I followed-up late the following day via the same process, and this time the call centre shared the UPS tracking # and proof of delivery to the store. Was transferred to the store again who with the S/N ""went line-by-line"" by their delivery manifest"" to confirm the didn't have it. 

The Apple Store suggested ""I file a claim with UPS"", but is it really my responsibility to do so? I just want my Mac Studio. I see where this headed - a long investigation and dispute; and I wondered if someone could share further ideas that may help.

Thanks!"
"Always hitting period key instead of space when typing on safari. This.needs.to.be.fixed. How many others are frustrated by this? I find it very poor design by Apple to change the keyboard configuration when using safari. I get that you need the period key more to type in a url. However every time I’m trying to type in a search on safari I end up hitting the period key instead of the space bar so all of my searches.come.out.looking.like.this. 

I think many of us are so used to the keyboard we don’t need to look at it when typing. For years now I’ve never been able to remember that when you are in safari the keyboard layout slightly changes. 

I wish Apple would just give the option to disable this infuriating keyboard feature."
"Apple, it's time to make sync smarter. There have been many attempts over the years to reduce network load, from MacOS Server caching updates for iOS devices, through to iTunes Sync over Wifi. But now with many iCloud Sync, Apple don't appear to have made any attempts at making this ""smarter"".

Depending on your sync goals, there's one glaring flaw with using a portable device on battery to record content that is cloud synced, it inevitably pauses sync until the device is plugged in, whether you're out on the street, or at home, it won't matter. And it's during this time that if something goes wrong with the device the content is lost.

Isn't it about time that Sync was introduced as a service on all devices/OS' so that when a device is on battery, but on the same network as another device (which is configured to sync the same content), it will then regardless of corded state, sync that new content to the other device via Bluetooth/Wifi (as appropriate). This serves to ensure that content is securely recorded in at least two locations, it reduces internet bandwidth/load, and is much more timely than double hopping all the devices up to the cloud and back down. The development logistics would be somewhat less complicated than developing an entirely new system beyond introducing ""receive"" sync capabilities on OS' ... from there they can either use network discovery, or a cloud based public/private IP matching system (that is, when a device contacts the sync server, it records the public IP, and if the private IP subnet matches with another device, then Sync is directed to the local device and not the internet).

The ultimate goal is to make sync more timely and more reliable using the local network where possible to ensure content is in multiple locations, especially if one of those locations is a corded device (e.g. iMac, etc).

Now, if this is meant to be already implemented and working, then I have absolutely no idea of determining if it's working or not because I have many gigs worth of video on my phone sitting on the desk next to my iMac with sync paused because ""reasons"" ..."
