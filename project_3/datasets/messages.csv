"apple should support icloud drive backups to time machine bluf/tldr: apple should make time machine capable of keeping local backups of data that has been offloaded from your device due to icloud drive's optimize storage option.

apple has time machine to support local backups.

apple offers optimize storage with icloud drive for those who have limited local hard drive space.

unfortunately, any files macos decides to not keep locally due to optimize storage will also not get backed up to time machine nor other backup solutions that i'm aware of thus reducing those files offloaded to icloud in a ""one copy state"" and at risk of data loss that can be caused by a multitude of things including user error.  also changes made to those files on other devices will never make it to time machine unless you access that file on the mac connected to time machine causing macos to download the file again.

i understand there are folks who have data caps and can not spare the possible excessive data movement which could be caused by such a system but i'd love to see apple offer an option to get around this.

just give us an option, along with a warning that the feature could cause excessive data usage, where time machine can temporarily download a file from icloud drive to back it up then remove the temp file.  it would only need to do this once for the most part as any files you are actively changing after that point would be downloaded anyway.  for files modified on other devices icloud could use a modified tag just like local incremental backups use so time machine could grab the most recent update for backup.

i dunno, i know this is full on tldr material for a lot of folks but i'd love if i could get more people to think about this and maybe the community can start giving some pressure that apple could eventually respond to.  i'm going to submit my suggestions to apple but one dude ain't going to change the flow of apples development."

"dont trust icloud with your data! (lost many files) first of all i know that its kinda my fault for storing all of my documents only in icloud but i somehow trusted apple to keep my data safe after an old harddrive broke and i didn't wanna get my own nas system.

two days ago i realized that almost 900gigabytes of my data in icloud was just gone.   
all folders were still there, only the files in the folders were missing.

i immediately  looked into my ""recently deleted"" folder in icloud but there were no file in there.

since i didn't know when or how my files were removed from my icloud (which only i have access to) i contacted apples support.

the apple support told me to go to [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) and try the ""data recovery"" thing on the bottom of the site.

the ""restore files"" thing on [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) found 5000 deleted files that were to be permanently deleted in 2 days. so i instantly got to restoring those files. the website wasnt made to restore many files at once tho, so i had to restore them in packs of around 100files.   
every time i reloaded the website the counter went back up to 5000 since there were much more than 5000 deleted files on my account.

after 2 days of almost continuous file restoration i was finally done...  
but most of my files, especially the important ones were still missing...

the (very nice) person from the apple support created a high priority ticket for the technicians in america to look at my case and get my files back.

sadly the support rep called me a few minutes ago with the information that the techs finished the restoration... which by itself would be great news if not almost all of my files were still missing.

&#x200b;

so to sum it all up, i was stupid and trusted apple that icloud is a safe place to keep my data and now have lost more than 900gigs of photos, memories, documents and have no way of recovering them. (state registration card, purchase contract of my car,  rental contract of my flat, childhood photos, photos/memories of deceased relatives, all of my programming work from school, and so on)

so please always save your important files in multiple places and don't trust big companies to keep your data safe.

&#x200b;

(they should definitely add the feature that onedrive already has which sends you a notification if large amounts of data got deleted from your cloud storage)"

it was honestly a nice reminder to never take anything or anyone for granted, and to cherish both the little and big things in life because they could easily disappear in the blink of an eye.

just wanted to share that lol. good luck to y'all and i hope you've created some memories through the feature as well :)"

"apple needs an option to ""trust"" certain airtags whenever i hang out with my friends one of us end up with a notification that an airtag is moving with us.

find my will only let us dismiss it for 24 hours and won't let you nickname them.

this is a big issue because we just ignore airtags alert now, assuming it's about a friend's airtag. so if someone were to actually track us with one, we would think anything of it.

apple needs to give an option to trust/ not notify for certain airtags and let you nickname them so you can tell if the airtag is a friend's or actually being used to stalk you"
"what could apple do differently for icloud password resets there's been many recent conversations about the impact of a thief taking your phone and knowing your unlock passcode (either through shoulder surfing or forcing you to divulge it).  apple needs to find a very difficult balance between: 
1.	your data being kept safe from other people 
2.	you being able to get your data back even if you stuff up by forgetting or losing something 
3.	respecting privacy and trust expectations, particularly with end to end encrypted data 
4.	doing the above for the majority of the population that is technically incompetant, forgetful, often doesn‚Äôt read or follow basic instructions, and doesn‚Äôt plan ahead... 
  
even with apple‚Äôs current implementation we see many more people losing access due to forgotten passwords or broken/lost devices or out of date recovery info etc, vs the kind of theft being addressed here.  forcing users to know the current password before changing it can‚Äôt be implemented without also removing the other password reset methods that trust the same device (eg. pushed 6 digit 2fa codes).  the net impact would be to significantly increase the number of people losing their data or at least being very unhappy at the delays of account recovery. 
  
while the obvious best move is for users to use longer alphanumeric passcodes and/or be careful who is looking when entering the passcode, most people won‚Äôt do this and the real world is messy (see #4 above).  i know, i know, personal responsibility and all that but it is what it is. 
  
some proactive steps apple could take, however are:
1.	more user education & warnings (eg. a ‚Äúsecurity checkup‚Äù notification in settings every 12 months - remind user about the passcode‚Äôs critical importance, check&update trusted numbers, recommend using recovery contacts, re-enter the recovery key to see if you‚Äôve lost it etc) 
2.	when resetting the icloud password or changing 2fa settings - *if* a 28 digit recovery key is already set, require either the current icloud password or the recovery key to be supplied.  this enhances security for users who have decided to enable the recovery key, but some other people are going to lose their accounts by accident because they lost their recovery key and password... 
3.	[terrible idea] add an optional separate passcode for the keychain.  this will lead to some people losing their keychains the same way people lose password protected notes and complain about it despite the warnings they‚Äôre given.  the extra passcode can also be extracted from you at gunpoint.  i hate this idea a lot - imo its better to let people choose to add a separate password manager if they want, and remember this information can still be extracted from you by force - there is no way to avoid this. 
4.	[terrible idea] add a ‚Äúthis device is trusted‚Äù setting. disabling this blocks the device from changing icloud security settings and receiving pushed 6 digit 2fa codes, or icloud sms 2fa codes being sent to it.  it can only be re-enabled via a different device logged into the same account, or with the recovery key.  i hate this idea too, its a nightmare. 
  
and some reactive (post-theft) steps apple could take are:  

5.	 allow the account recovery process even if a recovery key is set, if the recovery key was created in the last 1-2 weeks  
6.	allow old (reset) recovery keys to be used for 1-2 weeks  
7.	allow password resets via deleted recovery contacts, if they were deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
8.	allow use of an old trusted phone number for password reset or account recovery, if it was deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
9.	for arbitration of 6/7/8, successful use of an old item invalidates newer items of the same type"

"i'm a doctor and just released my first app ‚Äì a responsive mindful breathing app for stress & anxiety website: https://www.lungy.app
app store: https://apps.apple.com/app/lungy-breathing-exercises/id1545223887

hey guys!

lungy is an ios app that responds to breathing in real time, transforming your breath into a playful, interactive experience. i started working on it in 2020 during the first uk lockdown as a way to make breathing exercises much more fun and engaging. it's initially a wellness app, but hopefully at some point it can be developed into a platform for people with breathing problems (asthma, copd and long covid). i think it really makes the most of iphone hardware (it should run on iphone 6s+), with real-time cloth, fluid and rigid body sims all running on the gpu. you can also even create your own music using a synth and sequencer (go to settings/create music).

there are obviously lots of breathing and meditation apps out there, i wanted lungy to be different - it's about tuning into your surroundings and noticing the world around you, so all the visuals are nature-inspired or have some reference to the physical world. i didn‚Äôt like other apps required large downloads and/or a wifi connection, so lungy‚Äôs download size is very small (<50mb), with no geometry, video or audio files.


would love to hear feedback - thank you!"
"what made you switch to apple? i was seeing an apple add in reddit and i was thinking. why apple spends money in ads? don‚Äôt they have a strong fan base? when i jumped to apple was mostly to have a reliable ecosystem. previously had a huawei ecosystem (laptop, cellphone, tablet and headphones). but the cellphone would get issues with bank apps too often, my smart watch would glitch, and really small details that just slightly annoyed me. 

so in your case what made you jump to apple ?"

i am searching for an alternative closed-in look and functionality to the guake terminal in macos.

functionality:

2. ability to customize switching to a specific tab with a keyboard shortcut (like in guake)
3. top-down terminal

it had been a while since i was looking for the perfect transportable audio setup, as i am always on the go. i like neutral sound; at home, i have kef ls50 speakers with a nuprime amp and the go campfire ara iems with a dragonfly dac/amp. finding a good comprise that would allow good sound and the possibility of being transported in a suitcase by plane was challenging. i had been thinking of going with an apollo twin and small bookshelves from either presonus or neumann. but it was still a lot of weight, and the setup would not go very low.

i went to the apple store for a listening session, but unfortunately, laying homepods on a table 50 cm below the ears with ambient noise does not do the trick. i ended up coming back home with two.

after setting them up as pair and selecting the output in macos, i opened the audio midi setup to check the bitrate and depth. i was pretty sure i heard airplay2 was bringing lossless, but there are some nuances ([apple airplay 2 supports 24-bit lossless audio, but you can‚Äôt use it | digitaltrends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/apple-homepod-24-bit-lossless-audio-airplay-2/)), and we are stuck at 16bit 44.1khz. figure out the logic behind being in the ecosystem (streaming from a macbook or an iphone) but still being software lock to the lowest quality. cherry on the cake is bye-bye streaming the alac library, their own lossless codec.

sound-wise, i admit it‚Äôs impressive! they sound way bigger than they are,  the soundstage is excellent. the high feels pretty bright, and the mids are clear. but when it comes to the base, although they are well-defined, they are way too pushed. i check the setting in the home app to discover that there is an option to reduce bass. it sounds way better; it leaves room for the rest, but it feels like a straight cut below 70hz. so we are stuck between choosing overkilled lows or no bass; it feels incomprehensible, given the potential of the hardware.

even with these unpleasant surprises, i will keep the pair of homepod because it corresponds best to my use case. it‚Äôs an unbeatable form factor for the sound, the dsp is great, and the setup is frictionless. it would not take that much to make the homepod appealing to a broader audience with a software update that:

* allow lossless streaming via airplay from any apple device
* add an eq setting for the homepod in home app"
"ecosystem question from an oblivious ex-user hi,
i see so many youtubers that just keep on saying the same thing over and over, that ""apple devices just communicate well with each other"". i used to have some apple devices back then, but i definitely did not see any ecosystem magic happening. my parents have the latest iphones, apple watches, apple tvs but they apparently don't see anything either. but that may be because they aren't searching for it.
these days i myself am a pixel user. the pixel also has an ecosystem and i would like to find out how the apple one is to compare, since i heard it's better.

so i decided to go here to ask for some nice examples of apple devices working well together.


-----------
update:
thanks for educating me. just to summarize what i learned, i decided to create a sort of ""venn diagram"" in text.

apple only: using ipad as second screen, handoff (clipboard, files), stats from watch on appletv screen, using phone as webcam (although this is coming in android 14), airdrop with pc, signing phone documents on pc

both: headphone audio-switching, controlling tv, find my, synced texts between pc, phone and watch, ""airdrop"" (in quotes because it's called nearby share on android), cloud sync, password manager integrated into os, photos app syncing between devices, unlocking device with another device, airplay (chromecast on android), home devices automation (turning off tv when you're not home for example) - this last one requires set-up, continuing websites from computer on phone or vice versa, scanning documents to pc, transferring calls to other devices easily, starting maps on watch when phone navigation starts and vice versa

google only: headphone audio-switching on windows, synced texts on windows, touching 2 devices to wirelessly transfer files, being able to open android apps on windows and them syncing with your phone apps, usb tethering (extremely underrated, low-key amazing)

i think i put everything you guys mentioned in here. thanks for clarifying, from what it seems, the gap isn't really big.

"does apple notify if if a pair of 2nd generation airpods pro‚Äôs has been following you? 
like, if someone‚Äôs trying to steal a car that costs tens of thousands of dollars or something, a pair of airpods pro‚Äôs seems like a small investment, which they‚Äôd also get back if the car was stolen, or, if someone is obsessed enough with a person, they could just use airpods to track them. yes, it‚Äôs not nearly as discrete as an airtag, but it‚Äôs still not that difficult to hide if you try, especially in a car. the battery won‚Äôt last that long, but i‚Äôd still be creepy.

i haven‚Äôt lost my pair yet, so i can‚Äôt say if this is how they work, but apple claims that they can be precisely tracked."

"announcing notifications has anyone had any success getting their ipad or apple watch to announce notifications out loud?

i‚Äôve been experimenting with this announce notifications. on my iphone 14, i successfully got it to start announcing notifications from some of my most important applications. i went through the process of toggling on announce notifications, selecting those apps that i want it to announce notifications from, and then toggling on announce notifications on speaker.

i followed the same process on my ipad mini 5. yet despite me toggling on the same buttons, etc. that i did on my iphone, my ipad mini doesn‚Äôt announce the notifications. again, this is weird because i did the same thing on my ipad mini, that i did on my iphone, which now successfully announces the notifications i want it to.

also, i toggled on the announce notifications button on my apple watch, and selected the apps i wanted it to do so for. but yet, my apple watch is not announcing the notifications.

am i missing something here? some steps? any insight into why my iphone successfully announces notifications but my ipad and apple watch won‚Äôt?

thanks!"
"i asked chatgpt to summarize the changes in recent icloud terms of service. can finally be informed and not just blindly click accept. edit:  **read my update below before believing this.**

thank you for providing the previous version of the icloud terms and conditions. i have compared it to the current version and here are the key changes that i have identified:

* section 1 (terms and conditions) has been updated to clarify that the agreement governs your use of icloud and any related apple services, products, and software.
* the previous version of section 2 (your account) included a subsection on the use of touch id and face id to access icloud. this subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your apple id.
* section 3 (use of icloud) has been updated to include a subsection on icloud backup, which allows you to backup and restore data from your ios or ipados devices.
* the previous version of section 4 (icloud services) included a subsection on icloud keychain. this subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead includes a subsection on ""icloud private relay,"" a new feature designed to enhance the privacy and security of your internet activity.
* section 6 (user content) has been updated to include a subsection on live photos, which allows you to share animated photos with others through icloud.
* section 10 (apple's intellectual property) has been updated to clarify that apple may use feedback you provide about icloud to improve the service.
* the previous version of section 11 (indemnification) included a subsection on the use of touch id and face id to access icloud. this subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your apple id.
* section 12 (dispute resolution) has been updated to include a subsection on class action waivers, which prohibit you from bringing claims against apple as part of a class action or consolidated action.

these are the key changes that i have identified between the previous version and the current version of the icloud terms and conditions. please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other changes that i did not identify or that are less significant.**

later edit:  **as embarassing as this is, i'm going to leave this up instead of deleting it. but i've learned a valuable lesson in ai being ""confidently incorrect"" or better more accurately, bullshit it pulled out of its ass.    i would have expected this to be a start to understand the terms better but in manually comparing them, there's not even the words ""biometric"" anywhere in the new terms nor ""face id"" and ""touch id"" in the old terms, to pick a simple but glaring example.**"
apple hits 'major milestones' in moonshot to bring noninvasive blood glucose monitoring to apple watch 
"voice to text recently became so bad it is unusable for business. my experience is that about five years ago apple's voice to text was pretty good save for some minor fixes it needed.

nothing has changed with my voice, though i did buy an upgraded iphone.  but what has coincided with updates over the last two years is that its voice to text got a lot worse - then, very recently, it became garbage tier.

it's little wonder why i see so many drivers texting now - we can't rely on the phone to not make the other party pissed off.  but it isn't merely while commuting - it's also in the calm work environment.

and what's with it constantly trying to leave a space between the period at the end of sentences?  what's with commas placed in nonsensical places?  i'd much rather it skip trying to punctuate my voice than punctuating it badly."

i am currently on 50% left with ~4hrs sot, which is roughly an estimated sot of 8hrs. that's good i guess?

"one of the rare times where a product leaves you amazed i have owned the airpods pro for a while and upgraded to the 2nd gen when they were released. i haven't had any issues losing any gadgets in a long while (knock on wood!), so in early january when i was traveling for work and staying in a friend's apartment while he was away it was disappointing when i couldn't find my airpods. ""find my"" had listed them at my location a mere 45 minutes earlier, but they were nowhere to be seen. i figured my streak had come to an end and i went out a few days later to replace them (they never popped back up on the map and i had them okay a sound and never heard anything).

skip ahead to 6-7 weeks later and i had just arrived back at my friend's apartment for another work trip. i always pay for a professional cleaning after i stay there and i walked in to find two earbuds sitting on the counter near the washing machine... ! i felt a pit in my stomach and searched the washing machine for the case and eventually found it in the dryer, sticking to the ceiling. *the airpods had been washed and dried. * 

i reached in and, trying to look on the bright side (they weren't lost, after all), collected the case. i opened it up to take a look and was shocked to see the light go on... and then my phone vibrated and let me know that my airpods had been located! could it be, could they be functional? i put the earbuds into the case and plugged it in to charge. 

thirty minutes later came the moment of truth--i unplugged them and put them into my ears. the familiar tone sounded and my phone connected to them! and then, i went to apple music and ... they sounded perfectly normal! after having been lost for over a month, during which time they were fully laundered, it was as if nothing ever happened!

maybe i shouldn't be impressed... but i am. to go through that sort of ordeal and still work perfectly well could easily be luck (and it probably is!), but it still shows a level of quality and reliability that i don't readily associate with other brands or products.

anyway, i don't know why anyone should care about this trivial story, but i thought i'd share so my positive experience is noted and in case it helps anyone to hear it."

the battery life on the apple watch is just too short for my lifestyle, i need a wearable that lasts multiple days per charge. this is important for me so i would even accept a fitness band and sacrifice smartwatch features.

i haven‚Äôt seen any articles or youtubers talking about this, perhaps i am part of a particular bubble that just doesn‚Äôt seem to find this useful. i know that apple stock camera, the measure app and some accessibility functions make use of it. however more interested whether some applications that really depends on it, it‚Äôs a bit strange that such feature is made so mainstream but i don‚Äôt see any pone talking about it.

thanks.




update so far:
beside what i mentioned the apple stock app above (camera, measure and accessibility), apparently used for

-	 extensive and maybe daily use by people that need to measure 3d objects
-	dimensions of an interior (floor plans, house or even caves). mainly personal use, but also business use
-	medical profession to scan body part
-	drone scanning of grounds

as i was synchronizing the settings of the 6th gen side-by-side with the 4th and 5th gen units, i noticed that the 5th gen was much brighter than the other two. now i realized that on the 5th gen *true tone,* a feature of these ipads, wasn't activated yet. but it was! that's when i realized it wasn't functioning! i called apple and the result was that it needed a repair that was covered under the standard 12 month hardware warranty. so i sent it in to apple.

i was just informed by apple that the repair could not be made because there was another problem with the device. the usb plug receptacle was damaged and that it needed to be replaced. that type of damage is not covered under the standard warranty. my choices were to not have the repairs done, or to let apple keep and recycle the unit or, cough, pay $799 for the repair.ü§Æ

i used that unit daily since november. i experienced no problem with the usb plug receptacle. yet here i am. this is not a complaint. my days of complaining are over. i will accept the unit back of course. i'm curious to see what, if any, difference there is with the usb plug receptacle when i receive it back! if it is returned as i sent it in, i can do without *true tone.* when the 7th gen ipad 12.9 is released, i'll get that one too.

i always get applecare+ but the unit needs to be within the time frame that one would qualify to purchase applecare+. this unit was beyond that time period.

warranties of any kind, from any company, are not black or white. they are gray. in this matter, for me, it is insignificant. but for a hard-working young person who struggles to get along in life, i believe this would be a big disappointment. my purpose for this post is to make readers aware, to expect the unexpected; to always be prepared."

"solved: apple mac mini m2 pro wifi issue if you have a wifi issue with your brand-new apple mini m2 pro, you might want to try:

1. powering off the mac mini.
2. unplugged the power cord.
3. push down the power button and hold for 15 to 20 seconds.
4. plugged the power cord.
5. power on the mac mini.

this process worked for me.  other suggestions from the web did not work."
"iphone 8/plus is peak design hear me out. 

even though i'm usually an android user, i always tried out some apple products, including iphones (i'm a tech fan, i do not stick to only one company) 

but the early iphones always kissed my eyes tbh. 

i'm currently rocking an iphone se (22) next to a p6p, and i may stick to the iphone for a longer period. 

i love the design with homebutton. it feels and looks so timeless and elegant. 

my biggest wish would be that apple keeps doing the se lineup in this design or even add one in the plus-size like the 8 plus. maybe put an oled in it, but i'm fine with the ips retina as well. 

i love that you can hold this phone without being on the screen instantly, i don't know what it is, but i prefer this sleek look with a square display over the modern, almost bezel-less designs. 

i can't be alone with this"

edit: update phone has been charged and handed over to my flo for the duration of the investigation.
i appreciate all the responses and kind words from everyone. this has been incredibly hard for me and my family and i'm grateful that everyone has been so kind."

"beware ordering same day delivery i ordered a new macbook pro for my company. it was to be delivered to my house by postmates/uber within a few hours. i received a text saying get ready for your delivery. then a text saying your delivery is arriving. a guy came to my door w/ an apple bag, showing my name and address and order #, and my new computer was taped into the bag. he asked me if my name was ? i said yes. he had me sign for the delivery. i took the bag and shut my door. i received a text saying my order was delivered. a few minutes later, he rang my door again. i don‚Äôt know why i answered. but i answered, and he said he had delivered to the wrong address and he must take my computer back from me, please hand it over. wtf? i said no, this is my computer, i paid for it, i signed for it, i have all the payment and delivery receipts. he kept insisting and implying that i was a thief. i got my husband involved. my husband tried showing the guy the bag proving this is the correct address and he needs to leave. the guy kept threatening saying he‚Äôs going to ask one more time then he will call the cops. i told him to call the cops then, and shut the door. 

he called the cops, i called the cops, they came, were super bored w/ the whole thing, it was clear the delivery guy was in the wrong, they showed him the actual bag he gave me that the computer was in, that listed my name and address and order#, proving he was at the right address. the cops said the guy then apologized to them and drove away. 

but i was left shaking and nerves a mess. so i called apple to let them know what happened w/ their delivery. the lady on the phone was horrified and apologetic, said that should never have happened, told me i did everything right disengaging and contacting police, that the guy handled it wrong. she said he is not law enforcement so if he thought he made a mistake he had no authority to go demand my computer back from me, he should have contacted apple and they would have easily and quickly confirmed that he delivered to the correct address. 

so going forward i am going to just pick up my orders myself rather than trust uber drivers, and highly recommend for others whenever you can."

"just released a major update to dime, a beautiful and intuitive personal finance tracker and budgeting tool. now with income tracking, overall budgets, ui redesigns and more! hey r/apple! hope you‚Äôre having a great weekend.

tldr: [dime 2.0](https://apple.co/3ancqcn) is here with income tracking, overall budgets, a ui makeover and more! it is a beautiful, intuitive expense tracker built with ios design guidelines in mind. and, it's 100% free with no ads or paywalls.

nearly half a year ago, i launched dime 1.0 as a project to kickstart my programming journey, and was taken aback by the response. i am immensely grateful for all the comments, reviews, and feedback i have gotten ever since, majority of them being from this subreddit!

the most requested feature by far had got to be income tracking. i was initially rather reluctant to add this in as it would essentially require a complete overhaul and migration of existing data models and the ui built around them. additionally, i felt it would diminish the simplicity of the app that many users had grown to love. nonetheless, with the help of the 300 beta testers on testflight, i was able to experiment with different integrations of this new feature, and eventually landed on one i was really satisfied with.

today, i‚Äôm proud to present dime 2.0, its biggest update thus far. and of course, no changes to the pricing model - still a 100% free with no ads, paywalls, or data collection.

üí• what's new in v2.0!

-	the feature requested in almost every support email - income tracking.
-	redesigned input interface that minimises excessive swiping if you have many categories.
-	redesigned category list with category suggestions and the ability to reorder categories.
-	rebuilt the insights page to minimise lag and crashes.
-	lock screen widgets for ios 16.
-	overall category-less budgets!.
-	added interactive line graph to the home page (turned off by default, can be accessed via feature lab in settings).
-	insight filtering configuration now persists between sessions i.e. if you configure your insights page to show monthly statistics, it will stay that way from then on (and not revert to the default, which is weekly insights).
-	added triangular indicators to the budget bar graphs which show the optimal spending percentage.
-	option to have a more compact budgets page by swapping the grid for rows.
-	custom time frames (e.g. 3 days, 5 weeks, 7 months) for recurring transactions.
-	swipe to delete transactions.

ü•∞ why you‚Äôll love dime

-	100% free forever, with no paywall or ads.
-	beautifully ios-centric design, with simplicity at its core.
-	insightful expenditure breakdowns over various time periods.
-	create budgets based on expense categories and stick to them.
-	create recurring expenses with custom time frames.
-	sync your expenses, categories and budgets with other devices via icloud.
-	custom reminders to input your expenses.
-	biometric authentication to protect your data.
-	home screen quick actions make capturing new expenses a breeze.
-	a gorgeous night theme for dark mode fanatics.
-	informative home and lock screen widgets keep you updated at a glance.

i genuinely hope dime will be able to help you cultivate prudent expenditure habits. any feedback or thoughts is welcomed, and appreciated. moreover, if you have found dime to be useful, it would be incredibly helpful if you could give it a great review on the app store. am unable to afford marketing for a free app, so ratings and reviews are my best bet at spreading the word about it.

a special thanks to all those who have generously tipped the app, all proceeds will go towards my upcoming apple developer subscription cycle payment üòä

have a great week ahead!

"ios 16.3 can delete data on your iphone/ipad without asking - i've lost 2500+ books hello,

in feb ios 16.3 has deleted all my 2500+ books from apple books on ipad. epubs and articles in pdfs, which were sorted in many categories.

probably, it has happened because my ipad's storage was full and ios had decided to delete books instead of caches, offloading apps or deleting icloud photos (which can be re-downloaded from the cloud).

without informing the user, of course. icloud wasn't enabled for apple books. no jb.

here is the story:

i was browsing in the evening, when my ipad has turned off - the battery was empty. i've connected the charger and left it till the morning. in the morning ipad was up and running, i was using it as usual. few hours later i've opened apple books and it was empty: no books, no covers, just empty collections. checked ipad storage tab - 50gb free space (this space was occupied by books) and apple books with 0mb for documents.

ok, going to logs - nothing unusual. silence. ok, i have a full itunes backup, not the freshest one - 6 months old, but better than no backup at all.

i was able to get into my ipad to make as low-level examination as possible.

what i've checked:

    /var/mobile/media/books/purchases - empty, all books were deleted
    bklibrary - empty, only categories
    /var/mobile/media/books/purchases/purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/media/books/purchases/backup-purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/media/books/sync/books.plist - some titles and filenames, but not all

i've identified when books were deleted - at 03:52:

    bklibrary (recovered records):
    table zbkcollectionmember
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;

    .....................................................
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;

then i've spent almost 1,5 weeks digging in ios internals and i was able to identify the key suspect - some sort of ""experiments"", which ios executes on user devices:

database of applemediaservices was cleaned by ios, so traces were hidden, but i was able to recover some data:

metrics.sqlitedb was hiding this (50+ events when my books were deleted):

bingo! time is the same as in bklibrary when records (and books!) were deleted.

so, ios has silently deleted all books.

later i have written a custom parser, which examined 2 600 000+ rows of raw data of some internal indexes, which ios uses and it helped me to recover some info: titles and file names.

still a long way to combine all findings for recovery.

findings:

* ios 16.3 can delete all books without asking
* itunes full backup is not backing up sideloaded pdfs & epubs in apple books
* when apple books app is backed up via itunes, bklibrary database is vacuumed, so no deleted data inside.
* no info is logged about deletion - but i'm checking for extra evidences
* logs are clean: no suspicious activity
* there are no single place with metadata for apple books - i'm assembling info piece by piece from many places in ios: databases, logs, activity data, thumbnails etc. 90% manual work.

i'll make a new post later, including all details related to my apple books forensics and recovery.

&#x200b;

p.s. keep in mind that ios can delete any data anytime - do manual backups. icloud can fail as well - imagine losing years of private photos..."

what paint program is this on a really old mac os version? 
"[promo codes] jester is a new ios app that writes photo captions for you [app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1661372840)

hi all, i thought it would be cool to use ai for something fun, so i made an [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jester-ai-caption-writer/id1661372840) that writes **instagram captions for you using just an image**‚Äîincluding puns, jokes, and hashtags. it usually gets the captions right and i‚Äôve been pretty astonished by how funny some of them can be.

how it works is you pick any photo (no sign-in required) jester generates four unique captions. from there, you can choose your favorite and edit it as you wish. if you're not happy with any of the captions, click the retry button to generate four more. you can also add context, use the photo location, or generate more variants of any caption. when you're happy, you can copy the caption, share it, or post to instagram.

captioning 5 photos is free every day and there's a paid subscription for unlimited captions (because running ai models is expensive), but i will share a promo code for a **free year with the first 5 people who comment** with a caption written by jester! if you're not one of the first 5, don't worry because you can have 1 free month using the code [sunday](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=sunday) which can be redeemed at [https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=sunday](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=sunday) (on iphone or ipad)

p.s. i understand the importance of privacy for people's photos, so jester does not keep or store any images at all."
"why is changing the display refresh rate so difficult?? changing the refresh rate for an external display is so g\*dd\*mn difficult... literally have to hold down the 'option' key to bring up some kind of 'hidden menu'. and half the time it doesn't even work!!! 

apple--why do y'all do this?? what is the point of this hidden menu that has to be activated by holding down some key--and it doesn't even work half the time!! it just seems like a really silly ux decision... super unintuitive. what could possibly be the logic behind building a hidden menu that is only visible while holding down some random key? is this another example of apple hating on power users and treating their users like children? i mean really... the only reason i can think of is aesthetic, they must not want the preferences window to be too cluttered. if this is the actual reason, lord help us...

this is what i'm talking about: [https://www.makeuseof.com/change-display-refresh-rate-mac/](https://www.makeuseof.com/change-display-refresh-rate-mac/) this sh\*t only works about half the time, the other half, the refresh rate doesn't even get displayed after holding down 'option'"
apple should release a game console they have so many great games on their ios already. another way to compete with the microsoft is to create a gaming console and turn those ios games into triple-a games. what games would you like to see on an apple game console?
"what is the best application for customize keyboard shortcuts for macos? hi apple community :),

i am new user to macos system, i came from linux (ubuntu 20) and windows 11, and i saw macos keyboard shortcuts are different and also not all the keyboard shortcuts that available in linux or windows can be done with macos, and hence i ask you what is the best third application for customize keyboard shortcut for macos for my following needs:

1. launching application from the dock by keyboard shortcut 'windows key + number' (like in windows 11)
2. selecting text and paste it with mouse wheel click (like in linux)

i believe in the future i will use much more keyboard shortcuts, i really love productive tools.  
i will be happy to hear from you on recommendation apps.

note: i don't have problem to purchase an app, but this is must worth it."
"clean installation of ventura appears to automatically enable filevault -- no recovery key supplied? when setting up a new machine or updating to a major release, one of the first things i do is enable filevault. in the past, it has always thrown up a modal dialog giving me the option to copy the recovery key, which i always do.

i upgraded two machine this week. using a usb installer, i wiped the ssd clean and started from scratch. upon first login to ventura, i went to enable filevault. it was already enabled, and at no point was i ever given the recovery key. apple support has no answer other than ""turn it off, then turn it on and get a new recovery key"".

great that they are trying to strengthen data protection on macos; bad that they have left people in the dark on how to recover if something going wrong. disabling/re-enabling is bullshit.

"icloud backup overrides whatsapp in app backup so what‚Äôs the point in of people backing up both? by making a icloud backup your saving everything on the iphone - a copy 

if you were to make a whatsapp in app backup a couple of days after your latest icloud backup, then have to reset or transfer your device and install from that said icloud backup it would load the icloud whatsapp backup that‚Äôs 3 days old ? not the newest in app backup that was made in whatsapp that was made 3 days later ? because it‚Äôs saved on the drive itself ? 

so essentially ios will always load the icloud backup before the whatsapp in app backup ?

edit - so turns out if you disable the icloud backup from the old backup delete the app then reinstall it it lets you load from the new manual backup"

"i got ask to set up a recovery key but i already have one (advanced data protection) - anyone else having issues with adp and recovery keys? i've enabled advanced data protection about two weeks ago and set up a recovery key before hand. the recovery key setup was always extremely buggy. after creating one, most of the time it would still say that i haven't set up a key yet. sometimes it works for a day, and then it shows ""off"" again for the recovery key in the settings. after some time i was finally able to also enable advanced data protection (always got the error ""unknown error occurred while enabling advanced data protection"").

now about two weeks later, with advanced data protection and recovery key both enabled, i suddenly got a notification on my mac saying ""account recovery method needed"": [https://ibb.co/8rpnckq](https://ibb.co/8rpnckq)

i clicked on it and it created a new recovery key instantly, without asking me again.

what is going on with this whole advanced data protection and recover key mess? anyone else having issues with that?

honestly i'm at a point now that i don't even trust the recovery key to actually work when i need it. since something must have triggered the message in the screenshot above, even though i already had a key set up. and all the issues before with having set up a key but not being able to activate advanced data protection or showing the status of the recovery key as ""off"", even though i had it enabled."

"has anyone else noticed a huge increase in the amount of spam they get in their icloud email addresses? i keep an apple/icloud email address because i've had it since the days of [mobile.me](https://mobile.me) and, in fact, have a tiny little user name on it. so i use it for the sole purpose of whenever anyone says ""what's your email address?"" i can say ""i'm [pdc@me.com](mailto:pdc@me.com)"" instead of ""i'm p o r k c h o p underscore d...""   


but, recently, i've noticed i'm getting a ton of the worst kind of spam from that email address - obvious phishing spam, obvious ""congratulations! get your free harl3y-davids0n motorcycle"" type spam.  


i keep waiting for apple to tighten up their filters but... no.   


am i the only one seeing this?"
"apple store repair and service is really dissapointing this is a bit of a rant, 

i spent a large part of today driving to and from the apple store to get my companies older 2015 15‚Äù mbp looked at. random shutdowns on battery have been happening for a number of years but it hasn‚Äôt been a priority since it has been plugged in most of the time. we‚Äôve recently brought someone new on and wanted to give them this mac to use - but they need something reliable while being away from power. 

i was pretty sure the battery was the issue, but i did not want to get it replaced only for it to be something more serious like the logic board. we‚Äôre a small company and need to be smart about our expenses. the battery cycles are 280-300 for a 7 year old computer. i spent 30 minutes on apple chat last week and they recommended going in-store to get it looked at where they can do more in depth diagnostics. it‚Äôs a 40 min drive each way, but if it helps illuminate the issue then its worth it. 

first off, everyone at the conestoga (canada) apple store was very nice. my complaints are not about their direct service but the corporate policies they have to follow. 

they ran a diagnostic on the laptop and it came back with 80% battery health. they ran the diagnostic plugged in. i had it unplugged a couple of times at the apple store and it would shutdown as it usually does when the battery is sub 60%. in the rare cases where it does not shut down the battery drops really fast. 

i am more than willing to pay for the battery to be replaced. but, in order to replace the battery on the 2015 models they need to replace the top case (keyboard, trackpad). **because the battery health is at 80% (and not 79% or lower) - they can‚Äôt replace the battery without charging me for a top case replacement! **the battery fee as quoted on their website is $250 (all prices in canadian dollars), but with the mandatory top case replacement it jumps to around $700. not worth it for a 7-8 year old computer. 

what frustrates me is, the apple tech in-store had no agency in the matter. it was clear as day the battery was failing and leading to restarts. yet his own system would not let him order the battery replacement without the top case charge being applied because it was 1% over the required number for it to be eligible. his best solution was to use the laptop on battery as much as possible until it hits 79% and then to come back to get it fixed. driving 40 mins each way again in the hope that they will replace the battery seems like a bit of a fools errand.

over the last couple of years i have had other repair needs (apple watch battery, airpods connection issues) and the experience always ends up being the same. the people at the store can see the issue, but have no agency to get it fixed. 

this laptop in particular, was purchased at the apple store for $2500+ cad, plus apple care +. we never used apple care before it expired and now we‚Äôre being denied a battery replacement (without paying the extra fee) because the health is 1% off replacement level according to their diagnostics. yet the real world performance is clearly failing at a basic level. 

i am a little late to the game in getting apple devices, but my impression was that apple had the best service and while they charge a lot for their tech - the support is top notch. that simply has not been my experience in any interaction i have had with them in the last 3-5 years. i don‚Äôt know if this is a canada issue, or all apple stores. but i am just do disappointed in the entire process. i don‚Äôt have a lot of free time and to waste it on something like this is really frustrating."
"iphone silent switch should be able to switch to a focus instead of just silence. would love if i could set the silent switch to change to the ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù focus for example. switching between different focuses would be really great.
this would allow for some people to still call through while everything else is silenced.

sadly the only options that silence has is whether haptics are left on.

"what happens if i downgrade my icloud storage, and what is the difference between not paying/not downgrading and downgrading? first of all, here are some key points of information that you'll have to remember in my case  
1. i'm currently using the 200gb icloud storage plan, but i plan to downgrade soon (within around a week) in order to not have it required to be paid monthly (due to financial reasons)  
2. my iphone only has 64 gigabytes of storage; it is a pre-paid phone (which cannot be returned) and i do not have any other devices that are able to fully download all of my icloud storage  
if i were to downgrade my icloud storage from 200gb back to the default 5gb, what will happen to the rest of the data that exceeds it? (keep in mind that my iphone only has 64 gigabytes, and none of my devices have enough storage to download all of my icloud storage) if my photos won't sync to my icloud storage (uploading), will it still load the full-resolution images (downloading) when i view an image on my iphone that has been shrunken down to the optimized size?  
i read an article that said:  
""if you stop paying for your icloud storage, you will receive a pop-up on your phone telling you to pay. if you refuse, you will have 30 days to get your data from the cloud before it's erased permanently. if in those 30 days you decide to keep paying, all your stuff will remain there.""  
i have questions about this:  
there are 2 routes that are in question:  
1. the route where you simply do not pay for icloud storage and do not downgrade (which has already been specified that one will have 30 days to download all of the data before it gets wiped)   
2. the route where you downgrade your icloud storage to the default 5gb (which it is unknown to me what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb) to not have to pay monthly anymore  
for the second route, i wish to know what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb once i downgrade my icloud storage; what will happen to my backups? will my photos still be read from icloud storage (for full resolution)?  
tl;dr: i have very valuable data on my icloud storage that, due to financial reasons, cannot be kept paid monthly, so i plan to downgrade my icloud storage, and i can't download all of my icloud storage to any of my devices because they don't have enough storage either, so i ask 3 questions:  
1. what will happen to the data that exceeds the default 5gb?  
2. what will happen to my data backups?  
3. will my photos still be read from icloud storage (meaning that will the optimized saved photos on my iphone still read the full resolution videos and images placed on icloud)?"
"genius bar is a horrible experience and a complete waste of time. unfortunately i've had a lot of issues with my apple products this year and have had the unpleasant experience of dealing with apple support.

in early january, my m1 ipad pro 12.9"" stopped charging about 16 months after purchasing. now i am an electronics hobbyist and i know a thing or two about troubleshooting and i did all i could without opening the ipad. when i contacted apple support they told me i needed to make a genius bar appointment and the only ones available in a reasonable timeframe were during the work day. so i took a couple hours off to drive out the the apple store only to have to wait an extra 30m after my appointment time for the ""genius"" to check the usb port for dust and verify it wasn't charging (something i already did before) before telling me i was screwed and a replacement would be $800. i ended up taking it to a third party repair shop and they replaced the usb c port for $200.

recently i noticed my airpod pro 2 case battery was draining about 20-25% per day without even using the earbuds. apparently this is a common problem that multiple people report having. i called apple and they guided me through resetting the device and told me to call them again if the problem persisted, so i did. when i called them again after testing, they told me i could schedule a genius bar appointment and get a replacement. so i repeat the process and drive out for the appointment and the ""genius"" takes my airpods to the back to run some tests. when he comes back out after 20m he tells me he could not find anything wrong with them and that my options were to live with the problem or send it in to an apple repair center. i opted to send them in. we'll see if apple lives up to their warranty or not...

either way, each of these appointments took about 1h30m of my time only to have apple's genius representative to tell me to pound sand. in both of my experiences, the in-person representatives i met were unhelpful, uncompassionate, and slightly rude. apple products cost way too much to have this poor of a support experience

&#x200b;

edit: i forgot to mention. apple will not ship my airpods back to me from their service center. i have to spend another 60-90 minutes in order to go to the apple store to pick them up again"

"apple's $3000 laptop: a heater or a macbook pro i9?  hello everyone,

if you're a macbook pro user, you may be familiar with the issues that have plagued the 2018 i9 models. despite the significant price tag, these laptops suffer from severe overheating and throttling issues that can make the computer nearly unusable.

many users have reported that their macbook pro i9s will overheat and then slow down or shut down to prevent damage to the system. this problem can occur even when the laptop is not under heavy load, making it difficult to use for even basic tasks.

what's even more frustrating is that apple has remained largely silent on the issue. despite numerous complaints and even a petition signed by over 11,000 people, the company has not taken any significant action to address the problem or compensate affected customers.

it's not right that users have to spend so much money on a product that fails to live up to its promises. it's even worse that apple hasn't faced any consequences for this issue, leaving users feeling frustrated and unheard.

so i'm asking you, fellow macbook pro i9 users, do you think it's right that apple hasn't faced any consequences for these issues? what steps should the company take to address the problem and make things right for affected customers?

let's raise our voices and demand action from apple on this issue. our hard-earned money deserves a laptop that works properly. thank you for your time and attention."

"dumb question: what desktop intel or amd cpu completely beats the m2 pro in the mac mini m2 pro ?

"recommendations to improve apple health's medications feature # *tl;dr - let's create a singular master thread of requests, to send to apple, for apple health's medication functionality.*

i was so excited by the new medications offering in apple health. as a chronically ill person who has more than 12 medications to track (and often change) every day, i was relieved that apple would finally offer us something that i wasn't getting from 3rd party apps, as well as the bonus of smooth integration across my apple devices (really important for my physical disabilities). 

the initial offering is ok, but it has huge potential. i've no doubt apple already has a long list of features and changes they plan to make with the functionality but i know from a product development standpoint, it's really important that they hear from the consumers which requests are most vital. i'm not entirely sure if they have, or plan to, consult with people who have chronic or complex health issues, but i do feel it's important we let them know they could really help improve our lives with a few tweaks. 

this realisation led me to start submitting through their [health feedback form](https://www.apple.com/feedback/health/). unfortunately there is a character limit and i know that most people will not submit a form for every single suggestion. i personally gave up after the first 5. so i've come to the conclusion of creating a master thread that can be shared with them directly. that's what i'm hoping to achieve here. 

if you use the medications feature, or even just tried it but didn't continue, please have your say. if someone has already made a suggestion you agree with, upvote it! please also include your country, as functionality currently varies and will be helpful to give context to your feedback/suggestion.

thank you in advance üòä"

"apple and uber have left me empty-handed and out of pocket - $2,098.04 dollars worth of apple products stolen from an uber eats driver i recently had a terrible experience with apple and uber that i wanted to share with you. i ordered an iphone 14 pro max and an apple watch ultra gps watch through apple's website, which were supposed to be delivered to me by ubereats. i paid extra for the items to be picked up from a local apple store and hand-delivered to my address. the uber driver assigned to the delivery falsely marked it as delivered and never showed up, despite my clear instructions and follow-up text messages. i waited outside the entire time and the delivery wasn't ever made.

i contacted apple support, and although they initially agreed to replace one of the items, the watch they later decided to cancel the replacement order, and denied me the replacement for the phone. the result of this has left me with a $2,098.04 hole in my pocket and leaving me with no other recourse. to add insult to injury, unfortunately, the police department is unable to file a report for civil matters.

i am deeply disappointed by the lack of assistance and resolution from both uber and apple. i have evidence of the conversations with the driver and video footage of me waiting for the delivery outside my building. my question to the community is, has anyone else ever experienced anything like this with apple, and if so, do you have any recommendations on how to best address this matter?

i hope that my experience will serve as a cautionary tale and that both companies will take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. i realize that this is an unofficial community site for apple and while i have no expectations of this message being seen by them, i wanted to raise awareness to everyone making purchases directly from the apple store, especially via the use of third-party delivery services such as uber-eats and postmates.

**\*update 02/16/2023\***

today, i spent several hours speaking with various apple representatives from the escalations team. eventually, i was connected to a ""senior manager of the online store"" who informed me that the investigation into the matter has been closed and that apple will not be pursuing any further investigations. according to apple, a delivery was made, and they will not be compensating me for my losses. i requested evidence that the delivery was made to me personally, but the representative stated that information regarding the internal investigation could not be disclosed to me.

after my attempts to contact apple and resolve this amicably, i feel like i have hit a dead end, and unfortunately, the criminal who stole my $2,098.04 worth of apple products appears to be getting away with the theft. i am utterly speechless.

i made contact with a second police department in my area who was willing to make a police report and filed this under ""grand theft"". i now have this along with the other evidence i've collected.

**\*update 02/17/2023\***

i am pleased to inform you that a member of apple's leadership team contacted me and has agreed to issue a full refund for the total cost of the stolen items.  i am thankful for the opportunity provided by apple to resolve my issue. however, the refund process to my original payment method is still pending, which might take a few days considering the holiday on monday in the us. i remain optimistic that i will receive my money back by tuesday and will update this thread as soon as the entire amount has been refunded.

however, it is disheartening to know that the criminal responsible for this theft may get away with it. sadly, this is the unfortunate reality of living in california. nonetheless, i appreciate the effort and attention given to this matter by apple's leadership team.

to the apple subreddit community, i would like to express my gratitude for the valuable comments, feedback, and advice provided. your input has been immensely helpful, and i sincerely appreciate your time and effort. thank you all for your contributions.

**\*update 02/22/2023\***

as of this morning, my bank account has been credited with the total refund amount as per the commitment made by apple's leadership team.

i also wanted to highlight that despite the promise of two separate representatives asserting that the team responsible for handling loss/theft of items would be reaching out to me within 24-48 hours on the 16th (6 days ago), ubereats **never** made any attempt to contact me regarding this matter."

"i am going watch only in my day to day life. if apple gave us ipad and/or mac integration i would throw my phone in the trash. feeling the fatigue of smartphone addiction i got a cellular apple watch series 8 and put it in the drawer for the last week.

edit: put the phone in the drawer last week. sorry for being vague. 

i love it. there is something liberating about being able to go out in public and not having the whole wide world of the internet in your pocket. if you are careful the watch battery will last all day and you get your calls, texts, as you would on your phone. apple really should lean into the watch being the phone for people who are sick of their phone. i use my ipad when i ""need"" apps. but otherwise i do not think that i will return to full time smartphone usage again.

edit: to save on battery i actually found that sony still makes dedicated mp3 players not connected to the internet to offload listening time. its like its 2005 again."

"optimized battery charging i'm considering taking the free iphone my company offers - which i previously always declined.

right now im looking into it again and am checking for the features and apps/ workflows that apparently don't ""just work"" with ios.

one example is the smart charging. there seems to be a feature for determining how one uses his phone and then charging it till 80% and only completing the charge once the used algorithm deems it the right time. right not i only charge my android for a few minute a day so that i reaches about 80% and have hard capped it there. due to the slow charging speed iphones i would charge it overnight and therefore need this feature to work properly.

from what i found online this system doesn't seem to work that well and on my girlfriends xr it deems 3am the perfect time to be fully charged... 

so why is there no setting to set a specific time for the phone to be fully charged or even better, have it depend on the set alarm time of the next day? is there a way to set these obviously needed settings and i just didn't find them?

are there other ways to fix this?"

"whats the point of 2fa if you can just change your password on your iphone without it? (medellin gunpoint robbery) just read a terrible story in medellin reddit of a girl in a city park getting tossed down a hill and robbed.  they made her write down her apple password.  then of course they changed the password on her apple account.  apple is of no help recovering her account and of course the phone is gone, etc.

after being glad the girl is ok, i thought for sure that i was protected from something like this because i have 2fa.

nope!  when you head to settings, it says, ""because you are logged into icloud, you can change your password.""  no 2fa!  then it says ""you want to log out of all your other devices?""

every other little thing i log into, for instance the new york times that i signed up for using apple's anonymous email service, requires me to use 2fa.  

so why when changing the password am i not required to do any 2fa?  is it because if you lose your password they could just send it to your email which is on your phone anyway?  

is there a way to truly theft-proof your phone?   because when a gun is pointed at you, its a good idea to fork everything over including passwords."

new macbook air said to launch next quarter following rumor of 15-inch model 
"inconsistencies with ""the ecosystem"". the integration between apple devices is really great. notes, reminders (more on that later), unlock your devices with the watch, airdrop etc. it would be really hard to switch back to pc/android as it doesn't really have any of that. however...

apple watch can unlock my iphone and macbooks but not my ipad. one of my laptops is 7-8 years and my ipad is the latest pro with m2.

the books app knows my position in ebooks across devices but for audio books (bought in the apple store) it doesn't sync. also, if i'm listening to an audio book on my iphone there is no indication of this in ""playing now"" on my apple watch.

if i leave my computer somewhere that isn't my home and then leave i will get a notification on my apple watch that i left it behind. if i leave it at home i don't get that notification. so far so good. but even if i go out for a walk with the dog i will always get a notification that my ipad is left behind.

if i listen to a song on apple music on my phone and pause it then tell siri on my watch to continue playing music it will play whatever i played on my watch before.

alarms set on my phone will sound on my watch. alarms set on my watch will not sound on my phone. this one i actually kind of like but it would be nice if there was an option to only have the alarm ring on certain devices depending on focus model. i probably shouldn't get started on siri since she really suck, but a small thing like ""set an alarm on my iphone"" get the response ""set the alarm for when?"" ""1 minute"" ... alarm is only set on your watch, not your phone. 

i never get any reminders on my ipad. iphone, apple watch and macbooks all do.

is this intended behaviour and i'm just not ""getting"" it? are there any workarounds for any of my niggles? i'm open to third-party apps, especially for audio books since i really dislike the apple audio book interface in general."
"books bugs updated to 16.3.1 today and disappointed but not surprised to see the books app has become worse again. 


you can no longer tap the screen to see how many pages are left on a chapter, if you click all it does is show the time and battery icons at the top, which you then can‚Äôt dismiss without hard closing the app. you also can‚Äôt dismiss the big x in the top right. it might sound like minor issues, but they had a perfect app and have made it worse with each update.

"can't add android to group chat so i just attended a meet and greet type event and one person started a big group chat. i have an android phone and they were unable to add me to the group because everyone else had an iphone. it's likely i am going to be excluded from this group as a result, and the couple people who tried to add me just shrugged and said i should just get an iphone.

i don't understand why apple makes it so difficult and borderline impossible to integrate with the other major players in the phone industry. it's designed to be exclusive of non apple products. why do so many people stand by apple products despite the major compatibility issues with messaging?"

"there is something wrong with the mouse, cursor, and magic trackpad 2 in m1/m1*/m2 macs. this is gonna be quite a long post but **if you are also affected by the mouse cursor stuttering and jumping, either with the internal trackpad or with the external magic trackpad 2 feel free to chime in and share your results, experiences, workarounds etc.** anything that would help the community to overcome this issue.

&#x200b;

# background

i bought my first arm-based macbook air 2 years ago as a backup device. my main workstation was still my intel mac. whenever i used the m1, i noticed some cursor stutter after about 20 minutes of working or so. it's like the refresh rate for the cursor suddenly drops to like 24fps.

this is not the general slowdown that you experience when the cpu is busy or the memory is full. it can happen when doing nothing but clicking through items in the finder with nothing else ressource-hungry going on in the background,

what ""fixed"" it for a few minutes was to close the lid, open it again, maybe repeat that a few times and the cursor was back normal. this has already been discussed a lot in threads on reddit and i'm surprised to find the exact same issues still being present after more than 2 years of arm macs.

&#x200b;

a few weeks ago i had to upgrade my main workstation (intel macbook) to an arm-based mac. i set up my magic trackpad on it. of course, each new device can feel weird at first but after the first hour of using i noticed that i am still kind of unsuccessful at hitting buttons, marking text etc.

\- everything felt imprecise,- the refresh rate would randomly drop like i know it from my 2020 backup mac,- additionally, the cursor would take random jumps¬†of like 5cm/ 2 inches across the screen.

my productivity dropped as i had to second-guess and correct each cursor movement to get there where i wanted to get. my wrist started hurting on that very day (wrist joint issues were the reason i had to purchase a magic trackpad 2 a few years ago in first place and i absolutely loved the trackpad ever since).

&#x200b;

# radio?

i had somewhat similar issues when first moving to a usb-c mac (the first intel that required dongles for hdmi, usb etc.) when using a third-party dongle as this has disturbed the radio on the mac. so back then i bought the original apple dongle as well which solved these radio issues (also discussed in great extent across reddit).

this case here is not about radio tho, i also experience these issues when not being connected to an external screen, and not having the dongle plugged in.

&#x200b;

# third party apps?

some forum post said that third party apps cause this, so based on apple support's advice i went into safe mode and only used safari for my work, no external screen, no other apps opened: same results.

&#x200b;

# comparison with intel?

thinking i'd go crazy i placed my old intel mac at the exact same spot on my desk to see if this suffers the same problem. i was blown away at how smooth the magic trackpad cursor was on my intel mac. it felt like it had twice the refresh rate, twice the precision and none of the pain that comes with using the arm mac. i need to mention that the intel and the arm mac have the same apps installed because i transfered the whole installation from the intel mac to the arm mac.

&#x200b;

# comparison with other macs?

as i know the next step would be a replacement device, i was curious whether that would fix things. to cancel out any issues with apps on my arm mac, or with my arm mac's hardware even further, i've tried a few friends' arm macs (these friends also all know the cursor refresh rate issue on their arm mac but don't use a magic trackpad). needless to say, the exact same issues started happening with my friends' computers as well. i attached my ""old"" arm backup mac and the issue happened on that device as well. to give a short summary:

&#x200b;

\`\`\`

m1 air 2020 on macos 12.6: problems

m2 air 2022 on macos 13.1: problems

intel pro 2018 on macos 12.6.2: no problems, smooth cursor

\`\`\`

(tested with more devices too but this cancels out any macos version issues)

&#x200b;

# radio part 2 - connection via cable?

then i found this thread:

[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363) (21 ‚Äúme too‚Äù)

for testing, i‚Äôve connected the trackpad via a lightning cable. it is way better that way. is it possible that the radio in the macbook air m2 is much weaker or placed unfortunately? it really isn‚Äôt usable with the arm-based macbooks.

however, the connection via cable isn't perfect either - while working, after a few days suddenly the cursor was unresponsive, the trackpad couldn‚Äôt move or click for a few seconds. after that, it went back to being so wonky again, as if the cable wasn‚Äôt attached. frame rate of the cursor also seemed lower and everything felt indirect. as if the mouse driver went into some kind of compatibility mode that doesn‚Äôt do any of the magic that cursor tracking usually involves. like toggling mouse acceleration in windows, it feels completely different and weird suddenly. as soon as that happened, i started mis-clicking buttons again because i constantly either overshoot cursor positions (like going past the button that i intended to click) or undershoot them (not reaching the desired cursor position in the first move). temporarily moving to the intel mac, i hit everything as precise as i used to do. to cancel out any bias, i also did tests where i didn't know which device i was connected to and i could always tell the smoothness of the intel vs the awful navigation in the arm.

&#x200b;

# internal trackpad?

apart from that, as mentioned in the beginning i also often see the cursor stuttering even with the inbuilt trackpad. it‚Äôs like the refresh rate of the cursor drops:

[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253713321](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253713321) (221 ""me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253395232](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253395232) (173 ""me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252777347](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252777347)[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252957160](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252957160) (91 ""me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253672108](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253672108) (64 ""me too"")[https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/qj77mq/cursor\_lag\_continues\_on\_monterey\_m1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/qj77mq/cursor_lag_continues_on_monterey_m1/) (109 upvotes)[https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/u486mi/macbook\_pro\_13\_m1\_trackpad\_cursor\_lag\_issue\_no/](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/u486mi/macbook_pro_13_m1_trackpad_cursor_lag_issue_no/) (125 upvotes)

&#x200b;

# trackpad / radio / cursor delay?

additionally, i've taken slo mo recordings to measure the delay between my finger moving on the internal trackpad + external magic trackpad and the cursor moving on screen with both processor architectures - i can't find any significant delays that way either. so it doesn't seem to be a latency issue.

&#x200b;

# verdict

my best guess till now:

* arm macs have another set of mouse drivers, causing the refresh rate to drop
* arm macs have another set of mouse drivers that have different curves for interpolating and accelerating signals.
* arm macs have some additional radio issues, that don't cause all of the problems, but add to them

in any case, my wrist hurts. doing the lightning cable thing already helps a lot but i still need to restart the computer every few days due to the above-mentioned issue of the cursor messing up even on lightning. also, even with the cable attached, it still doesn't feel as direct and smooth as on the intel mac.

&#x200b;

# how to go from here?

i've spent way too much time on this problem already but i'm required to use a macos device for work and right now it looks like i will have some bad time ahead in the next few years if there is no solution in sight. if you have any info to share, let's work together to be either to either find a workaround, or gather enough information so apple can finally acknowledge the problem and address it."
"iphones are not the same anymore i am a long-time iphone user. for the simple reason that it comes with software that simply works. but somehow that was apparently the case. in my opinion, this is no longer the case. since ios 16, i have noticed that the iphone has more and more bugs in everyday life. i can put on my beats headphones and my iphone can't wake up for like 5 minutes or so. widgets are not displayed correctly or partially not at all, once i couldn't even open apps anymore, only one key combination helped to force a shutdown. this is very annoying, as the devices are really very expensive.

i have similar problems with my ipad.

what are your experiences? are androids now more stable than iphones?"

"elephas - personal ai writing assistant for mac, iphone, and ipad (ver 5.3 released) hello [r/apple](/r/apple)

i am an independent developer from india.

i have built an app called [elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-promo-sunday-1202-01), a personal ai writing assistant that works seamlessly across all your mac apps, as well as an ai-enabled keyboard for your iphone and ipad.

just released a new version of the app last week.

update: elephas and chatgpt are not the same; they have slightly different use cases. elephas applies an ai layer on top of your mac while you continue to follow your workflow.

**version 5.3 updates:**

in the latest version, i have released features such as -

**snippets -** configure shortcuts to perform day-to-day tasks with the help of ai. it supports all popular languages. you can do tasks across your apps, including editors and spreadsheet tools.

**tones** - to personalize text output and write in your own unique style.

**preserve formatting** - so that the generated text maintains the format and styling of the original text.

and many more tiny improvements and utilities.

# a brief overview of the tool -

first off, very pleased to share that now 500+ professional users use the app every day :)

elephas helps business professionals use ai to save time on day-to-day tasks. emails, documents, blogs, jira stories, social media posts, etc.

our users praise it as a swiss army knife for their daily productivity.

**""an ai tool that they actually use in their daily workflow""**

it differs from other ai tools in that it works on top of your favorite apps, so there is no need to switch between windows or work in a browser window.

you can get the power of ai within your favorite mac apps like mail, pages, docs, and any other apps built for the mac.

with elephas,

*   you can rewrite your content, improve it or even generate new content on a topic.
    
*   you can use it to quickly reply to your emails, messages, and social media posts.
    
*   you can even use it for creating presentations and generating excel formulas.
    
*   and now you can even define your own tasks with the ""snippets"" feature.
    

based on our user requests, i introduced the ai assistant to ios devices (beta).

it follows the same philosophy, wherein you can use the writing assistant without leaving the app you are writing on.

so you can use an ai keyboard within whatsapp, mail, imessage, etc.

here's the demo of how the ai keyboard works -

[https://youtu.be/y5vrh3clgyo](https://youtu.be/y5vrh3clgyo)

there is a wide range of utility features built into the app to make your daily workflow smooth and fast with the power of ai.

**one last point**

the app is privacy friendly. you can use your own openai keys, and none of your data is stored on our servers.

you can check out the tool on the website here - ¬†[elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-sunday-promo-1202-02).

there are a whole lot of videos here in this [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plpv207ven3s1hmfcq9lqg74erzjicbmoy).

**you can try the app for free for 30 days.**

i will appreciate your support and feedback.

thanks."

what apple learned from skeuomorphism and why it still matters 
"i hope/suspect apple isn't letting another ai opportunity slip **generative ai**  is here to stay and change our way of living once again. they‚Äôre in their infancy, but getting better very rapidly. big tech companies understand this new ai as a massive part of all our futures. staking a claim and building a leadership position is as important as dominating the web was in the 90s.

microsoft announced a new conversational search feature you can start using right now in bing and the edge browser. google on the other hand just shot themselves in the food with panicking and rushing their bard thing. 

**where is apple in all of this?**

apple has the tools to build its own generative ai with the neural engine built into iphone and mac chips that is capable of up to 15.8 trillion operations per second, along with core ml and machine learning apis. after all, apple spearheaded ai once with siri....but we haven‚Äôt seen any movement jet

***conclusion:*** apple has positioned itself as a technology leader for years now. i don't think they are so badly lead, that apple will give that up! of course, apple is one of the most secretive companies in tech, especially when it comes to software. apple could have big teams working hard to bring generative ai features soon. (they bought at least o ne generative ai company: ai music) i hope we get a surprise at a coming wwdc: world-class generative ai all over apple‚Äôs products! (i really hope that‚Äôs the case, because if they are late to the game on such a transformational technology, it‚Äôs going to doom its software to being years behind its competitors)

**what do you think?**"
"iphone users - do you want rcs? if apple were to adopt rcs would you find it beneficial? do you text enough friends/family with androids that it would excite you? 

genuinely curious if ios users have any desire for the feature. clearly tim cook doesn‚Äôt think so.

edit 1: results:

so based on the feedback we have a pretty mixed bag. 

1) majority of folks are open to it as long as it‚Äôs not overseen by google (none of you use a gmail already??). which makes the most sense to me, apple will always do it the apple way and would find a way to have full control over it as they always do imo. 

2) lots of you (mainly europeans) who could care less either way. i envy you, it would be nice if this didn‚Äôt even need to be a conversation. please feel free to convince anyone in na to download 1-2 messaging apps to accommodate android users‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll understand our pain. 

3) smaller portion of the crowd are in the hard no camp. main reason seems to be googles involvement or no reasoning given. 

interesting spread of results. i sit in the camp of why not improve the experience for all users regardless of platform if there is a clear roadmap on how to do it? not saying rcs in its current form is the final best option, but it‚Äôs a foundation that can be built on."

"apple names first people officer, shifting role from retail head "
"will siri ever become more intelligent? as technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, one question that has been on many people's minds is whether or not siri will ever become more intelligent. apple has been quiet about their releases and advancements, but with microsoft and google both releasing advanced ai models for search, it begs the question: what could apple be working on?

there are several probable scenarios in which apple has a chance to take the lead in the ai race. for one, they have already made significant advancements in on-device processing, which could serve as a foundation for further improvements. they have also announced an ai summit event later this year. additionally, apple has a reputation for keeping their cards close to their chest, so it's possible that they are silently working on something revolutionary.

the competition in the ai space is fierce, with microsoft and google both making giant steps forward in recent months. it's not just a battle between these two tech giants, though, and many people are hoping that apple will soon join the fray. bing's reawakening and google bard's offering coming up to everyone. 

the future of ai is uncertain, but one thing is for sure: the competition is heating up. whether or not apple will be able to go to the next level remains to be seen, but the advancements being made by other companies serve as a reminder of the gigantic steps that companies have to take in order to stay ahead of the game. it kind of feels like 10 years ago when we had a new smartphone release every week... we tried all kinds of new ui features, and the ios vs android war was full steam, i'm excited to see what's gonna happen!

what do you think? will siri ever become more intelligent? how do you see apple fitting into the ai landscape in the future? let's have a discussion!"

"heads up: new iphone and watch trade in boxes can cause confusion i just wanted to share here a new issue that i dealt with this year, that i haven‚Äôt previously experienced, to hopefully save someone else the trouble.

previously when i had traded in my iphone and watch, i recall the boxes being a bit different. this year i traded in both, and i received two boxes that to me were identical. they both had instructions for the phone and watch, i recall no clear marking to indicate which was which. i‚Äôll tell you why this mattered.

i accepted a trade in of my phone for $550, and $155 for my watch. apparently, i mixed up the boxes (still not knowing how i could have known the difference). this resulted in my phone being sent as trade in for the watch, and my watch being sent as trade in for the phone.

now since i had sent a $550 device in place of a trade in for a $155 device, apple sent me a gift card for the difference. since i sent in a $155 device in place of a trade in for a $550 device, apple had to charge me the difference.

so i ended up having to pay extra out of pocket than originally planned, and the only saving grace is that i now have an apple gift card for the difference. which isn‚Äôt really what i wanted, i wasn‚Äôt planning on spending any more money in their store for a few months.

i apologize if this is hard to follow, but the psa here is this: if you trade in a phone and a watch at the same time, be very sure you know which box is for which, because if you get it wrong the whole process is super confusing and you‚Äôll pay more than you intended to."

"protip: inserting text in a hyperlink within apple notes on ios there isn't a easy way to create hyperlinks in apples notes for ios. in apple notes on macos, you can easily insert a hyperlink by selecting the text you wish to create a link to and pressing cmd+k. this allows you to create custom text for a hyper link. 

i've found some sort of bug (or hack?) to get this to work on ios. here's what you do:

1. copy and paste link into your note where you want it
2. move the cursor within the link by holding down on the space bar and dragging the cursor
3. type whatever text you want
4. delete the front and back ends of the remaining link

"what‚Äôs up with apple‚Äôs design choices in recent years? they‚Äôre just all over the place it seems like, between being unsure of what color schemes to stick with (see mac desktop models in primary pastel colors vs. iphone/ipad/watch/macbook colors remaining pretty much neutral/industrial) and the fact that apple cannot decide on what screen bezel design they want to move towards, where is the consistency?
like most of the industry at this point, they are trying to move away from notched phones and towards fullscreen-ish designs, but while introducing the dynamic island design to iphones/just starting to move away from the notch, they‚Äôre now implementing the notch in previously-fullscreen macbook models‚Äîall while the ipad has moved to a bezeled fullscreen design. additionally, apple is still pushing the square-edged iphone/ipads while the watch line still retains the pill-shaped bodies of older iphone models, seen from the iphone 6 to 11 models.

does this inconsistency seem apparent to anyone else or am i just nitpicking? how do you feel about the trends in apple‚Äôs design choices of recent years?"

"apple health & fitness future? hey everyone,

as someone who recently switched to apple ecosystem, i am trying to learn more about the products and how to build up my ecosystem with meaningful additions. the way i do it is that i search for the products and examine their current state / features and what is coming. in general i am really satisfied with my mbp and iphone.

however, as a pervious garmin epix2 owner (now awu), this is where i feel apple lacks the most and thought it wouldn't be the case. i am not an extreme athlete, i don't need gps tracking or outdoor stuff trackings - i am dude that goes to gym, doing strength training. so in terms of 'workout' support, i am not that interested in that.

what i find garmin does way better is the features like: stress management, body battery, readiness score , morning report, step counting, and ..  most interesting to me, insights. 

at the moment, i have following apps: autosleep, heartwatch and athlytic (+ centr for fitness app). there is no fitness+ in my country. i did pay for the premium, but i still find it lacklustre, compared to garmin or even fitbit (i tested pixel watch for a while). 

i do not like the idea of having soo many third party apps, but if they would provide me with data the way i imagine apple would do (nice ui/ux, straight to the point, no need to be data scientist to understand insights, etc.), i'd be completely fine with that.

so i came here wondering, if any of you have any info on what is apple's plan in regards to health & fitness features? i learned that they have a dedicated executive role for apple health, so i would assume they would make big leaps here - but couldn't find any info on roadmaps or future features.

did i do my research poorly and the apps i chose are simply not the best for this? then i would be happy to test some you would suggest for me. for me, i don't need lots of raw data, but rather explanation of data and what can i do about it or what does it tell me about me / my pattern.

  
examples:

\- you had only 10min of deep sleep. it is advisable to have x amount for your age and goals. try going to sleep at y time and do \*this\* before going to bed.

\- you did only 100 steps so far. it is recommended to do at least xxxx steps per day. to target that goal  you need need to do 250 steps per hour. get moving now! (and it would actually track steps, not the 'stand time' like apple watch does).

\- your hrv was quite low during the night and your rhr was a bit increased. it seems you did not get enough rest during the night, so track your readiness score throughout the day. if you would like to exercise today, try having a nap in afternoon.

\- etc.

now it could be autosleep  / athlytic / heartwatch does say that somewhere amidst tons of numbers and data, but i would like to have it as an 'insight' section or a push notification."
"hello from /r/android! where do you see the industry going? as a pixel owner, i'm seeing the subreddit on team green grow incredibly stagnant. personally l use whatever gets the job done, and it feels like that is such a low bar now be it windows vs mac or android vs ios. cheap and expensive devices alike are incredibly powerful, versatile, fast and efficient.

on the android side all anyone seems to care about are foldables, and now each oem is really trying to make their own ""thing"". pixel wants ai, computational photography and automation to be its thing, and these are useful, but far from earth shattering. it all just doesn't feel as exciting as it once was, everything is plateauing. i'm so bored looking at benchmarks and tiny little tweaks to numbers.

i'm curious to see where you all think the industry is going? are phones simply an upgrade every 2-3 years now thing or is the industry going to rock itself again? has the industry matured and have we reached (or are near) peak smartphone?"

"what do you do with your macbook, and what can you teach me? my m2 max got delayed so i thought to make this post to help fill my void. i‚Äôm looking for a bunch of ideas and suggestions on what i can do with my new computer. for some context, it‚Äôs my first mac. i had a pc like 10 years ago and finally needed to update and since everything else i have is in the ecosystem i went with a macbook this time. 

i‚Äôd love to learn new things such as coding, whether it be in app development or in data science. i have friends that do both and it seems interesting and fun. i have started to get into photography as well, i have a 13 pro and i love taking photos with it. i do a lot of cooking and frequently write down my recipes and take photos in case i ever want to create content. 

what do you guys use your macbooks for? what programs do you recommend? any specific courses for improving my skills or learning new ones? i‚Äôm in my mid-late 20‚Äôs, don‚Äôt even work in my degree, and might be looking to move to a new city, so if i get good at any of this stuff i‚Äôll definitely switch it up haha. 

thanks for your help everyone!

edit: to everyone telling me to cancel the order, half the cost of this was covered so i‚Äôm paying 2 grand for a 4k machine. i‚Äôm not cancelling, i‚Äôd rather have an overpowered machine that i can learn to utilize in time rather than one that i‚Äôll need to upgrade again later. i appreciate you guys looking after my wallet all the same."
"i created a smart diary that allows you to have your own ai. called moolight - smart diary [download moolight - smart diary](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/moodlight-intelligent-note/id1631169735)

instead of writing a long journal, i love taking short notes throughout the day, in a bullet point format. in this way, i could better record the thoughts that could otherwise be forgotten.

my girlfriend writes diary every day. the problem she had is that after writing for years, there is no good way to see the changes in yourself, even though all texts are there.

we tried very hard to search for an app that could fit our need. but failed. **as a result, we took a lot of time to learn and develop our first take on this idea. of a smart note app.**

**moolight** is our answer. it features an on-device ai that could help us organize the piece of ideas into 15 categories. and try to provide some insights and feedbacks from all the notes automatically.

we don't want to sacrifice any privacy, as a result, a decision is made to keep all data to yourself & your own icloud. after tested out the idea, we found a way to make it even smarter and fit your own record style. as a result, you could train your absolutely unique ai on your device in moolight.

the more you write and correct the category, the better your own ai gets. in our own test, with the default ai, the accuracy is about 70% correctness. if you write for about 20 days with 5 bullet points per day, and correct the category. your could own a unique ai that do chores sorting out your notes 100% categories correctness for all your notes.

&#x200b;

**why bother creating another note app?**

complex tools makes it's easy to get lost. when using simple tools, the notes could easily scattered everywhere. why can't software help? we live in an age when technology advances every day, yet the software for notes seem to become unchanged since long time ago.

that's why we spent long time, realizing this idea. and had great fun developing this product. the idea is about writing without being disturbed. enjoy the ease of use brought by technological advances while having absolute privacy.

&#x200b;

**design thoughts**

my girlfriend is a data scientist, and i had background in software and design. we wanna to combine our experiences, and attempt to give this idea our best effort. since day one, we discussed and settled on the following ground rules:

1. we believe everyone should be the sole owner of our data, especially in a case for note or diary. so data never leaves your device or icloud. all data should be processed on-device with neural engine. it should be 100% functional when offline.
2. we wanna it to be smart, to make life easier. to do this, it should know how we feel when we write; it should know the realtime weather so my gf don't need to type in manually; it should know i'm writing about food, without specifying the category. it should be able to track anything that we ever want to know if we wrote about it.
3. we wanna it to be able to think. to write a short headline each day and help us recall. it should know the top content i'm constantly writing about, and use my data to give us some feedback. we wanna it know them all, yet do not ask for any information besides what i actually write.

&#x200b;

**why there are three tabs?**

today, gallery and insights.

the idea is that whenever you want to write something, it's in the today tab, this is where you focus on the moment. when you want to have a look at the past. all the information is well organized and truthfully present to you in gallery tab.

we can't predict the future. however, in some way, we could also get a glimpse of idea about future based on what we were doing in the past. this is what insights tab do.

‚ñ∂ today ‚óÄ ‚Ä¢ bullet based input ‚Ä¢ automatic added weather & location ‚Ä¢ mood lights to know your feeling ‚Ä¢ time travel to past and future ‚Ä¢ dynamic background that flows.

‚ñ∂ gallery ‚óÄ ‚Ä¢ refined card with mood color ‚Ä¢ daily auto headline ‚Ä¢ auto classification for each input ‚Ä¢ powerful search by time and types.

‚ñ∂ insights ‚óÄ‚Ä¢ cumulative days, and inputs count ‚Ä¢ weekly glance to be surprised ‚Ä¢ keyword to know what mattered ‚Ä¢ track anything as tags ‚Ä¢ know what made you happy with mood trend ‚Ä¢ random show to recall memories ‚Ä¢ mapped journey to mark your path ‚Ä¢ liked/web records to shortcut ‚Ä¢ customize modules on your preference.

‚Ä¢ icloud sync and backup for iphone/ipad/mac ‚Ä¢ face id for additional safety ‚Ä¢ customize color, typography, etc ‚Ä¢ recycled bin for accidental delete ‚Ä¢ automatic light and dark mode.

&#x200b;

**what can it do?**

**‚Ä¢ intelligent classification**

declutter the life events. work, food, study and so on. it just knows.

**‚Ä¢ understand your mood**

how‚Äôs your day? moolight will do the best guess.

**‚Ä¢ multiple organizers**

"have the m series macs killed the ‚Äúreplace a mac with the ipad‚Äù movement? i know personally, i went from wanting to try and get an ipad pro 12.9 to use a travel laptop to getting the m1 macbook pro as soon as i could. 

now i don‚Äôt particular need/want a large ipad as the macbooks now have the battery life and speed to match what i wanted. anyone else think this applies to the whole ‚Äúipad as a computer‚Äù movement?

i think the only thing apple is missing is some kind of entry level macbook like the old style plastic macbooks from circa ~2008"

thank you!"

"new homepods vs original homepods has anyone else got a chance to set up their new homepods in a pair?

i bought 3 today and used 2 of them to replace the pair in my bedroom. 

the audio quality is unbearably worse than the originals. they have harsh mids that are not present on any other speakers. it‚Äôs around 1.5khz -2khz. 

the bass is also very lacking. i am going to have to return these two because the sound isn‚Äôt just not as good, it is harsh on the ears. 

just looking for input from anyone else that is hearing this right now."
apple sales in biggest fall since 2019 
"psa: don‚Äôt let apple deny your request to update date of purchase for a brand new previous-gen product. had to escalate to manager level to get them to do it. just got off the phone with apple in what was an super frustrating experience from a company that brags about its consumer-friendly policy. 

i just bought a series 6 from an online retailer just last week and set it up today. after set up, i noticed that it said ‚Äúcoverage expired‚Äù. weird but no biggie, i‚Äôll just call apple and it‚Äôll be sorted out soon. or so i thought. 

first csr asked me to provide proof of payment which i gladly did. i even screenshared my phone to show the receipt in my email. he asked me to upload my screenshots. no problemo. he then transfers me to another csr.

i‚Äôm 20 minutes into what i thought would be 5 mins. the second csr informs me that due to the fact that it‚Äôs a series 6 they can‚Äôt update the date of purchase. excuse me? i bought it brand new from a reputable retailer (sportchek). it wasn‚Äôt open box or anything. the box was sealed. the csr gives me this gem: because the aw was shipped to the retailer in 2020, they cannot update the date of purchase. 

this was shocking to hear. i told her that it doesn‚Äôt matter to me as the end consumer when a product was shipped to the retailer. i bought it new and they have to honour the manufacturer‚Äôs warranty. she transfers me to her manager. 

i‚Äôm now 45 minutes into this call. manager gets on the phone and asks me what the issue was. i explained how i‚Äôm being told that apple does not cover its own new products just because of when they were shipped to a retailer. she apologizes and agrees with me and goes ahead and approves the update to the date of purchase. finally!! 

took me almost an hour on the phone to get done what should have never been an issue in the first place. so do not let apple reject your request to update the date of purchase if you bought a new apple product. consumer laws exist to protect the end users from this sort of bs."

"discussion: the friction between using an iphone and windows computer i have an iphone. i also have a windows pc at home and use a windows pc at work. i use the windows pc at work because i must, and i use the windows pc at home because it‚Äôs a requirement for my online business administration degree. additionally, i've always liked windows because it's what i'm used to. 

most of my personal life is on my iphone. the native calendar, reminder, and notes app all seamlessly connect to help me manage my life and be productive. i have notes integrated with the reminders app and reminders set out way into the future. this runs my life.

i‚Äôm really loving using windows more and more every day. whether it‚Äôs for school, work, or for personal use. the programs i‚Äôve used are so feature rich. they‚Äôre a pleasure to use and find out all the possible capabilities that can help me be productive. lately, i‚Äôve been learning more and more about excel and onenote. it‚Äôs honestly been fun and i‚Äôm enjoying myself quite a bit.

this leads me to a point of friction. i love using windows app‚Äôs on my pc, but my whole life is wrapped up on an iphone which i also enjoy. the webpages for iphone apps are quite garbage (looking at you apple notes). i‚Äôm considering making the switch from apple to windows and migrating all my notes and reminders to windows apps. 

my question is this: is it worth it? for those with an iphone and windows pc, which apps do you use to manage your personal life? are you frustrated with the limitations? more generally, what is your workflow?"

recently i was using the air 2 again, and realised it had such a better battery life vs the pro. despite being several years older (battery deterioration), it has crazy good standby time and lasts longer whole browsing or watching videos. have apple optimised their newer ipads for more power vs battery life? 

i have to say i feel like i need to charge my ipad pro quite often. while only browsing and consuming media."

apple's rumored headset needs more than an apple store app in vr to become a hit 
"i‚Äôm in love with my m2 max i‚Äôm a software dev doing mobile development and web development. my previous machine was a 2019 mbp with i9 and 32gb ram - so quite powerful imo. 

i just made the switch to apple silicon with an m2 max mbp and holy moly am i not disappointed! on the contrary. i can do android builds, ios builds, typescript builds, you name it, and this freaking machine doesn‚Äôt even get warm!

i also use a high resolution ultra wide screen and that alone was heating up my previous mbp due to the strain on the gpu.

before, even video calls would have the fans blow like crazy. now i have yet to find a task that makes the m2 sweat even a little bit.

"if you travel often using public transit you might find glarm useful. it‚Äôs an app that notifies you whenever you‚Äôre closing in on your destination and it‚Äôs been recently updated for ios 16! [glarm is available for free in the app store](https://apps.apple.com/app/glarm-location-based-alarms/id1523237367)

if you‚Äôre like me and you travel a lot by train, or bus you might not always recognize railway stations or tell quickly how far is your stop, so you start nervously checking the time and position on the map.

with glarm you can set alarm to ring, let‚Äôs say 5 kilometres from your destination and in the meantime, take a nap, or watch a movie without worrying about missing the stop.

**it was recently updated with support for live activities on ios 16** so now you can track the distance from the destination on your lock screen.

"i've just released pestle 1.4 with smart folders, pdf import, image import and more! hey r/apple! 

i'm will, a 20-year-old developer from adelaide, australia. i build [pestle, an intelligent recipe manager for iphone & ipad](https://apple.co/3sweywl) (the mac version is coming along well, and it will be worth the wait!).

if you're not already familiar with pestle, [checkout the launch post from 6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/sgctww/ive_just_released_pestle_transform_any_recipe/). but in short, pestle is a recipe organiser that lets you save recipes from any website.

# smart folders

this is one is really cool! pestle now has 'smart folders', which fill themselves up based on the criteria you set. want to filter your 400 recipes down to just 4-star or higher desserts that aren't alcoholic beverages? easy! as you save new recipes to pestle, they'll automatically be added to your smart folders.

# pdf import

this one is for those of you with cookbooks as pdfs. pestle can now show you your pdf cookbook and will guide you through adding your favourites to pestle. once saved, pestle will use its smarts to enable you to scale recipes, convert them, and more. 

# image import

much like pdf importing, pestle can now handle photos you've taken of recipe cards and the like, with live text on ios 16, scanning photos into pestle is a breeze.

### search improvements

# privacy first

frankly, it's none of my business what you cook with pestle, where you share it to, etc etc. that's why the [privacy policy](https://pestlechef.app/privacy) is so short, there's very little for me to say. first and foremost, **pestle does not collection identifiable information** (with the only exception of your email, if you even consider that identifiable, and also only **if you use email signup**, if you use sign in with apple/google, then this doesn‚Äôt apply. for analytical purposes, i do track daily active users, version breakdowns and such. **but none of this information is tracked back to you, it is 100% anonymous**. i use [telemetrydeck](https://telemetrydeck.com), a privacy-focused platform use by many other popular apps, such as apollo for reddit.


that sums up this update, it's my biggest update since releasing live activities (among other things), so i hope you like it :)

i would love for you to give it a try, so go get [pestle on the app store](https://apple.co/3sweywl)!"
"i just released oolong v2, a ""future forward"" budget app that can help you control the ""shape"" of your money! hey /r/apple, 

just launched oolong *v2* after two years of doing other... stuff üôà

#### [get it here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1549289924)

---

**tl;dr:** 

oolong is a ""future forward"" budget app that helps users control the ""shape"" of their money. whereas other apps like mint, ynab, and [envy](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/q5dd4a/i_created_a_budgeting_app_that_doesnt_collect_any/) are great at helping users understand ""what happened"", oolong is all about predicting ""what *will* happen"" so that you can make smarter financial decisions **today**.

---

**what's new?**

oolong is the reason i picked up ios development 3 years ago. the [original app](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/) was, admittedly pretty basic, but it got the job done! this latest version is everything that i've learned a lot about building enterprise apps over these last couple years along with: 

- completely new design (as requested by [/u/darpyface](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glj008n/))
- balance sheets and income statements
- multiple accounts (as requested by [/u/john-mcafee](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glicfor/))
- decimals! (as requested by [/u/lizadting](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/gli07qb/))

---

**use cases**

i've been using the oolong methodology for over a decade (then just an excel spreadsheet). it's the singular tool that i use to manage my money. hearing from several v1 users, many have used oolong to: 

- figure out how much to allocate to savings/investments
- plan major one-time purchases
- figure out ""how much apartment"" to rent/buy

---

**freemium**

oolong is free for the first 3 accounts (assets/liabilities) and 7 plan items (incomes/transfers/expenses). an ""in app upgrade"" can be purchased to unlock unlimited accounts and plan items, as well as remove ads.

i really think that oolong can help users escape the ""paycheck-to-paycheck"" trap. so, if you use and love oolong, but can't afford the upgrade right now, please send me a quick email at oolong@bracket.ltd with a little explanation about how you hope to use oolong to improve finances and i'll endeavour to send you a code!

"is this the mandela effect, or did apple announce wireless bluetooth or ncf tags for retailers around 2015?  i've tried looking into this for a little while and i can find no trace of it on the internet.

i swear i have a memory from probably around 2015 of a wwdc video where tim cook was advertising nfc/bluetooth/similar devices to brick and mortar retailers. i cant remember what their value proposition was, but it provided some digital services to customers.  maybe you download apps, order online, or similar - basically a glorified qr code. sorry, my memory is very patchy.

outside of the mention at the wwdc, i have no other memory of it (never saw it on their website, in person, etc). that, plus me being unable to figure out an actual use case for this product, plus not being able to find anything about it on the internet is making me thinking i've just made this up!

does anyone else remember anything like this, or have i lost the plot!?

(ps - to confirm, i'm not referring to airtags)"

"shared album invitations i can receive shared album invitations but for some reason when i invite people they never receive the invitation, it‚Äôs happened with multiple people, any idea why??"
"what is the purpose of making a service appointment? a week ago i made an appointment to get my battery changed. the price is being hiked in march, and my phone is a few years old still on the original battery. may as well change it before the price hike as it is noticeably weaker. (on my 6s i'd change the battery myself, but honestly i cba to replace iphone batteries myself now). 

so i made an appointment online, where i input that i was coming in for a battery replacement, the day i wanted, the store i would be at, and the type of phone i have. i even got the email & text reminder about my appointment this morning, so i drive to the apple store, get checked in, wait for a staff member to be available, start the initial info gathering part of the process.......just to be told the store doesnt have my battery in stock, and they would have to order it and wait 3-5 business days.

what was the point of the appointment?!? they knew when i was coming in, they knew what store i was going to, they knew what type of battery i needed. seriously, instead of a reminder email & text why couldn't i have gotten a message saying we don't have the battery yet, don't bother coming in. why is the battery only being ordered now...after i came in, not when i booked the appointment (ya know, more than 3-5 business days ago).

the ""most innovative tech company"" can't even link their appointment schedule with the apple stores? not even like i was at a third party repair center, it was an official apple store...

end rant"
"never ever ever get applecare through best buy total tech applecare + best buy=weeks of waiting

do not get best buy total tech for your iphone or, probably any apple product. these two companies need to acknowledge that the relationship isn‚Äôt working and it is at the customer‚Äôs expense. honestly, best buy, he or she is not that into you, move on. and customers- neither is interested in you, you‚Äôre just in a custody battle.

on 1/3 i brought my beyond repairable iphone into best buy for repair. i have total tech with apple care so it was fully covered. that all sounds good but what happens after is the most maddening b.s. 

1) the person i talked to at the geeksquad counter looked at my phone, could see it is well beyond repair and said they could not take the phone in because i would need to make a geeksquad appointment because they need to ‚Äúrun diagnostics to see if it is covered by total tech applecare‚Äù. it is. is this something i can look up online on my account myself? he says, ‚Äúyes, you can do that.‚Äù this makes no sense then why an appointment is needed to determine that because if i can look it up (and i already had), why can‚Äôt the geek squad dude standing in best buy who has my account pulled up in his best buy computer not find this information himself? but i don‚Äôt want to make his life difficult because whatever they have going on for an inefficient system isn‚Äôt his fault. i ask if i can get in for that appointment that day or evening. no. it will be 3 days. wait three days for them to look up my apple care. wtf. ok, corporate bullshit has me waiting a few days.

2) 3 days later i make the time to drive back over there again with the same issue-need the phone replaced. the person at the counter this time is more helpful to the degree they can be. she is like, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know why they made you wait and make an appointment we can just do this right here.‚Äù she says she worked in the phone section but that they don‚Äôt cross train which leads to that stuff‚Äîas in being required to make an appointment to verify applecare coverage. and my geeks squad appointment says customer want to verify apple care coverage as my reason for the appointment. um. no, i don‚Äôt, i want to move the repairs forward. i let her know that i appreciated her help and thought it seemed excessive to have to go in twice, 3 days apart just for that. she processed the phone, could see it is unrepairable and charged me for a replacement. she says it may be up to three weeks for them to replace. the phone but it does get overnight shipped both ways. ok. so i have to use an old phone that does not get texts from almost numbers, that does not get data because my sim is 5g and the phone is 4g. but, it‚Äôs temporary, it‚Äôll be fine. it is, however, my work phone so i have to tell everybody that i do not get texts nor do i have data.

3) days pass. weeks pass. i go to applecare to find out what is going on. there is no record of a repair for my phone with them because they run it all through best buy and cut the customer out. you cannot talk to anyone at apple because they have no record of your repairin their system. this leaves tracking a repair through best buy. when that happens it simply says, ‚Äúwe are moving forward with your repair‚Äô or some unhelpful sentence like. no timeline, no deadline, no contact info. 

4) i am now 25 days in from the start of this. i decide to call the store to speak to a human. instead it‚Äôs ai that tells me the phone attached to my number is currently in repair. omg i know this.  i say i want to talk to a person and ai tells me it ‚Äúunderstands‚Äù i want to talk to someone and the wait will be 7 minutes. 5 minutes in someone answers. but it is clear i have been forwarded to a call center.  i explain what i want to know, they tell me they will see what is going on.  hold. they return to tell me that my phone is being repaired.  that is so inadequate. i know this. i want more accountability on that end- what is going on, give me a date, etc. he tells me i should call the store and would i like the number.. no- because that is where i called and got sent out to them.  

5) today i go in to best buy again. they apologize and say they are unable to talk to any human being there and are only able to escalate the order and they say they have been doing it every other day and, will now, on day 24, start doing it daily. and they tell me this is typical of apple with them.

do not get totaltech for your apple device. pretty sure apple deprioritizes their best buy work, best buy gets your total tech money so they don‚Äôt care as it is still profitable for them and you are out your device for weeks on end, with zero accountability on either company‚Äôs end. absolute bs."

"universal control appreciation post so this is an upvote for universal control and a downvote for m2 mba only supporting 1 external display.

2. i have been trying to keep work / personal stuff separate 

now i have a set up where the two laptops are mounted on either side of my monitor. i have 3 screens!! i also can control both personal and work with one set of mouse/keyboard which is great. 

of course i still can't share windows across the machines, but i haven't found that to be much of an issue. i usually keep slack/spotify on one screen and do my work on the other two. 

i was pretty skeptical about universal control but i'm actually a pretty big fan of it. it works so much better than i thought it would."
"security keys, 2fa, account recovery testing i did some testing with and without security keys‚Ä¶

**scenario**: 2fa enabled, advanced data protection enabled, recovery key set, 2 recovery contacts set  
¬†  
apple id password reset - there are 3 options:  
1.	 you must have unlocked trusted device and must know device passcode and then you can change password in settings (can be secured more by blocking account changes with different pin) 
  

2.	you must know a trusted phone number and must have unlocked trusted device to get pushed 6 digit code to reset remotely


3.	you must know a trusted phone number and must have it to receive sms verification code/call and must know your icloud recovery key
¬†

logging in - there are two options:  
1.	must know password ; must have unlocked trusted device
2.	must know password ; must have working trusted phone number for sms/call
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†


!!! note i couldn't see a way to use recovery contacts.¬† apple says having a recovery key set means account recovery is disabled, originally i thought this would just disable the manual account recovery that happens when you phone apple up about it - but it doesn't make it clear this means recovery contacts don't work. [edit] however the recovery key or recovery contacts are still very likely important for recovering end to end encryption keys for icloud. 


___

¬†
**new scenario**: as above but with 2 security keys set as well  
¬†
  
apple id password reset - there is maybe 1 actual option:  
  
1.	you must have an unlocked trusted device and must know device passcode to use settings menu to change password

2.	iforgot.apple.com - pushes a notification to your trusted devices which takes you to do #1 above...¬† or you can alternatively get instructions for #3. it does not apply 6 digit code etc. 

3.	tells you to use apple support app etc.¬† when i try this currently it asks to confirm my phone number, and then takes me to a ""security key verification - to reset your password, verify one of your security keys."" screen.¬† but this is immediately popped over with a ""cannot verify identity - your action could not be completed because of a server error. try again."" message before i even have time to try to scan a key.¬† maybe its suspicious because of all the fooling around i've been doing. this is where imo it should allow you to have the security key and know the recovery key. 

4.	with the same factors as #1 you can also remove all the security keys from your account and remove the restrictions in place but this isn't really a separate option as its the same factors‚Ä¶
  
!!! so in this configuration, if correct, your account is gone if a) you can't unlock a trusted device and b) you forgot your icloud password. as above i don't feel this is correct - you should be able to have a security key + know the recovery key.¬† that said, this scenerio should be very rare?¬† and anybody who loses all their devices and forgets their icloud password is pretty unlikely to know their recovery key :p
  
!!!your account is not lost if you lose all your security keys - see #4 above you can just delete them if you have the factors for #1  

the recovery key or recovery contacts can‚Äôt seem to help you reset the password in this scenario, however they are still important to recover end to end encryption keys for icloud data. 

  
logging in there is only one option:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† must know password ; must have one of your security keys (or see #4 above)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† (that said, i only tested this on icloud.com, didn't try logging in to a new device because pain but i suspect its the same...)
¬†
  
google will let you have security keys plus other forms of two factor. however if you turn google advanced protection on, then it also reverts to only allowing security keys as the second factor. but you can set a recovery contact that they warn will take several days to process."

but after spending this week tying to collaborate with my partner on a house we're building (layouts, floor plan, dimensions, lists, etc.) in freeform, i find myself disappointed over how much is lacking. 

i'm hoping apple adds a lot more power and functionality in the future. 

primarily, i would love 

* the ability to change the dimensions of shapes (like one can do in numbers, keynote, pages)
* change background color, grid, grid type, etc. 
* hold down hand-drawn lines / shapes and have them snap into the shape 
* snap hand drawn lines or shapes to the grid 
* be able to select more than just hand drawn lines 
* be able to select / move / scale / rotate / duplicate groups of objects 
* be able to lock objects 
* have an object tree sidebar 
* have settings or preferences

for people who still have an apple watch and love it, great! but this is not the thread for you to comment on :d


**edit**: thanks everyone for all your very detailed reponses and discussions, super informative i will read them all and then decide!

**edit 2**: the single biggest issue for most people seems to be the battery life, so for that reason, for now, i'm out. once they get the battery-life up to a week, then i will reconsider. regarding the 'distractions' it's really hard to gauge as i know you can configure it and for every person who says 'it's a nightmare' another says 'game changer' as they don't have to use their phone as often. other reasons include longevity, as other people say, for the same money you can get a watch, though functionally poorer, will last decades."
"spouses sharing icloud accounts hello there reddappleiverse‚Ä¶ my wife and i have been using the same icloud account (my email) on all our apple devices since 2009 mainly because that was the only way to share purchases (before family support) and share a single icloud photo library (before icloud shared photo library). we keep our messages/facetime separate just by unchecking the other phone number unchecked in settings and never giving out the apple id email as a way to be messaged/called. we like that we can use ‚Äúfind my‚Äù to ding either of our devices which i do for her a few times a week. however, it has some annoyances like bugs where it shows missed calls to the other number, and messaging business chat shows up on both devices. other than that, it generally works fine and we are used to it, but i have 2 questions for the hive mind:
1.	does anyone else still do this? are there some other benefits i might not be realizing?
2.	splitting them seems like a good idea but a huge pain. can someone talk me out of this? anyone successfully completed a split like this?"

"touch up scratches on apple watch is there a good solution to touch up minor scratches on the apple watch? 

my watch has been working well for 2 years and the recent update has even made the battery life better. theres no point in recycling it since i won‚Äôt get any money for a perfectly working watch.

so is there a way to touch up scratches on the watch? so far i haven‚Äôt had any luck finding a paint product that can do that. even my car touch up pain which was a bit darker rubbed off after i try to cover the scratches.

any suggestions on how to cover up the scratches?"

"i thought apple laptops had excellent resale value...? i purchased a base model 16-inch macbook pro for $2,399 plus tax back in november 2019. core i7, 16gb ram, amd 5300m, 512gb ssd, yadda yadda. i've babied it ever since i've owned it and it's in immaculate, pristine condition. i've even kept the original box and documentation. 

i put it up for auction on ebay... and the best price i could get was $750. i was also disgusted by such low ball offers i'm getting on this laptop, both on facebook marketplace and craigslist.

$750? what the hell? i thought apple laptops had amazing resale value? this laptop has no dents or scratches whatsoever. i think it's worth at least $1,300.

"airpods max orders delayed 2-3 weeks, will apple release new colors? "
"heads up re: apple studio display i just bought two apple studio displays. i ordered them with a mac studio max and an m2 air but the computers will arrive in a few weeks and the studio displays are here now. i am currently using an imac 27"" from 2017. my imac is connected to an owc thunderbay4 which holds four 6tb drives. that is chained to another thunderbay4 with 4 backup  drives. the second thunderbay is chained to an owc dock to which i have two fast nvme ssd's for video editing. i connected my new apple studio display to the imac's second thunderbolt port and booted it. it was a no go for the display. studio displays must be connected directly to the mac and they have only one tbolt port (and four usb-c gen 2 ports).  it can't be chained. previously my imac had a different display connected to my owc dock but the apple display can't do that, nor could it boot if my other port on the imac was so heavily used. it turns out (an hour and a half with apple techs that have sent the issue to the engineers) that - apparently - the apple display is power intensive (in spite of it's own power cord) and can't deal with the imac's thunderbolt setup. the imac shares a single controller between the two tbolt ports. i have learned if i boot my imac with  the display connected to one thunderbolt on my imac and then add just one thunderbay and after that add the other thunderbay with the attached dock, then it's all good and stable but the display will not turn on if i boot with everything attached.  my 16"" m1 macbook pro max will deal with all of this attached at the same time so i am assuming the mac studio max will also since the 4 tbolts on the studio  are independent.    thought i'd clue folks in so since i mistakenly assumed my studio displays could be easily connected like my previous eizo display was. btw...the complaints about the studio display's web cam were warranted. i'll be buying a decent web cam. just horrible. worse than my old imac."

"apple should have an all mac event to me it would seem obvious for apple to have two stacked events a year (or every other year for macs) with a 1st quarter event for all things mac (mac mini, mac studio, mac pro, imac, macbook, air, pro, and accessories like displays and other peripherals) and the 3rd quarter event for obviously everything else (iphone, ipad, watch, airpods, tv, homepod, etc.). i know there's probably a reason why they don't do that but i also find it odd whenever they release a product in a press release and not in one of there events. or whenever certain products, like ipads, can either be released in either the first half or second half of the year instead of sticking to a specific release window.

obviously this is just a quick rant and personal opinion but i'd like to know what everyone else thinks and if anyone knows why apple doesn't do this."

"i wanted to use openai's whisper speech-to-text on my mac without installing stuff in the terminal so i made macwhisper, a free mac app to transcribe audio and video files for easy transcription and subtitle generation. would love to hear some feedback on it! when openai released whisper last year ([https://openai.com/blog/whisper/](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/)) i was blown away by how good it was at speech to text. rap songs, low quality recordings, multi language conversations, everything seemed to work really well! unfortunately the setup process required you to install a bunch of dependencies to then have to use terminal for transcribing audio. last week i made a very easy to use mac app to solve this, macwhisper!

quickly and easily transcribe audio files into text with openai's state-of-the-art transcription technology whisper. whether you're recording a meeting, lecture, or other important audio, macwhisper quickly and accurately transcribes your audio files into text.

**features**

* easily record and transcribe audio files
* just drag and drop audio files to get a transcription
* get accurate text transcriptions in seconds (\~15x realtime)
* search the entire transcript and highlight words
* supports multiple languages (fastest model is english only)
* copy the entire transcript or individual sections
* supports tiny (english only), base and large models
* reader mode
* edit and delete segments from the transcript
* select transcription language (or use auto detect)
* supported formats: mp3, wav, m4a and mp4 videos.
* .srt & .vtt export

**which version do you need?**

you can download macwhisper or macwhisper pro. macwhisper pro includes the large model which offers the best transcription available right now and has industry leading accuracy but takes a lot longer to generate. the regular version of macwhisper uses the tiny (english only) and base models, which are still very accurate and fast. depending on your usecase you might want to use the pro version. you can always change what version you want later.

gumroad has a 250mb file size limit for apps that are listed for free so i had to make that part paid. select **macwhisper pro** from the sidebar and pay 6 or more to get it.

"a lesson learned. avoid buying any secondhand airpods. to start, i will say i'm very tech savvy. today i went to buy some airpods pro gen 2 that i found listed on offer up bnib. i stressed to the seller that i wanted to verify the authenticity before i handed over the money. trust me when i say, these are the best fakes i have ever seen. i checked the serial number on the apple coverage website and it was all green. i connected them to my phone and all the settings that should pop up were there. every single serial number matched; the box, the case, the individual airpods, and even in the settings app. they even had applecare+ until 2025. these things had me fooled for a solid 4 hours, until i turned on transparency mode. i could tell something was off. i went to the apple store and 3 techs were stumped with the authenticity since it even registered on their diagnostics tools and showed a valid sn. the main tell was the font was ever so slightly off on the inside of the lid and the weight of the counterfeit pods were slightly lighter than authentic. moral of the story, do not buy airpods on third party marketplaces unless the seller is willing you meet you at apple and let a tech or two take a look at them.

&#x200b;

tldr: fake airpods are getting almost indistinguishable from the real thing. if buying secondhand or from a third party marketplace, do not trust anyone not willing to meet you at an apple store.

"world wide returns does not seem to exist bought an apple watch ultra abroad (usa) asked if it would work at home (eu) was told it would work and worst case my right to return was world wide. came home, setup the watch, realised cellular was not working. went to my local apple store to figure it out, they told me us sold watched some not work in europe and i could not return an item bought in a different currency.

it makes sense but it‚Äôs still frustrating, part of why so buy so much from the apple store is the great customer experience, you trust that they will give you accurate information."
"when is apple going to modernize the magic mouse? the original magic mouse came out in oct 2009 and the magic mouse 2 came out in oct 2015. it‚Äôs now 2023 and the design of the magic mouse is very outdated, with its charging port on the bottom and lightning port connector. do you think apple will bother to update the magic mouse a third time, or do you think they don‚Äôt care to? it would be nice to be able to change the mouse and use it at the same time, and to be able to use any usb-c cable laying around‚Ä¶"
"netflix is missing quite a few features on apple tv title, i'm sure i can't be the only one who's noticed this.

not only are we stuck with the old landscape tile design, but we're missing:

\- notifications (including the ability to see what is coming soon)

\- collections

\- top 10 trending

\- no way to remove from continue watching

\- a way to remote control? this is possible across every other tv device i use and isn't limited to google cast, as xbox & playstation both show in the ""casting"" menu (likely using netflix remote control)

&#x200b;

i understand these may be minor features, but the fact that even the ui looks super dated compared to the other platforms just raises so many questions for me. you're paying the same price as everyone else, and being punished for choosing to use the service on the apple tv.

the app was last updated on january 11, 2023 so it's not like it isn't being maintained. they're deliberately holding features back from apple tv users. how is this okay?"

"dropbox forcing ""files on-demand"" cloud storage instead of local storage i use dropbox to sync my files between a few devices. notably, i want all of the files to remain on all of the devices.

this weekend, i was presented with a message from my dropbox client that it wants to move all of my locally stored files from ~/dropbox to ~/library/cloudstorage. this is a huge pain in the ass, as it will require updating about a hundred configuration files to point to the new path.

much more disturbing, the new dropbox client indicates that all files will be marked as ""on-demand,"" *i.e.*, potentially not living on my devices but only in dropbox. this is alarming, since many of my workflows expect files to be available locally and to be immediately available, rather than waiting to be downloaded from dropbox. it also raises the ugly prospect of discovering that needed files are inaccessible when i'm offline, and being unable to access them (or, at least, without a lengthy delay).

some research revealed [this article from microsoft last year](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-disk-space-with-onedrive-files-on-demand-for-mac-529f6d53-e572-4922-a585-e7a318c135f0#:~:text=onedrive%20files%20on%2ddemand%20helps,new%20information%20about%20each%20file.) regarding similar changes in onedrive, and, further, that these changes appear to have been prompted by apple deprecating some kexts that onedrive had used for syncing cloud storage files. i also found [this macrumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/01/onedrive-mac-users-unhappy-files-on-demand/) suggesting that onedrive users hate this change and find it to be buggy.

i'm extremely irritated by this change, as **i never have and never will rely on on-demand cloud storage for these files**. these files are core to my daily digital life and i expect them to be available all the time on every device and kept fully in sync. i have plenty of local storage space for these files and i am accustomed to managing all of it. so these changes, which not only break current workflows but might introduce new and persistent headaches, are motivated by features that aren't even relevant to me.

i am so deeply irritated by this bullshit that i am now looking at other cloud storage providers that won't engage in this kind of behavior. if i have to blow an entire weekend reconfiguring my machines due to the ghoulish demands of dropbox, i may as well switch to a provider that is actually sensitive to users' needs.

recommendations are welcome."

"all apple needs to do is make the ipad pro into a macos closed system and voila. all apple needs to do is make the ipad pro into a macos closed system and voila. and keep their macbooks as open.

people who want to multitask like a pro on a touch device will actually be tempted by the openness of the macbook and might get one. and macbook users might be tempted by the portability of the ipad and get one, even tho they might not get the full experience, most wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúreplace‚Äù one with the other.

edit: i'm by no means speaking in favor of the community first. i'm speaking in favor of the, unfortinately, evil corporation that needs to please shareholders and sell tons of devices first, then to the community. and as shitty as it sounds, i think it's actually a great deal that we could get an improved ipados ux and ui, along with some tweaks, and let us run most of mac app store apps, just like macos runs ipad apps. that would be enough for me to save for an ipad pro."

"what‚Äôs the difference between apple notes and apple quick notes? what‚Äôs the difference between apple notes and apple quick notes?

i understand that quick notes are stored in notes but why not just send to notes vs send to quick notes.

"user feedback why doesn‚Äôt apple take user feedback seriously? 

let‚Äôs take siri for example. people have been sharing their experiences and feedback for years yet the product is generally not much better than it was on release. sure it received a more fluid voice. but as far as its functionality it‚Äôs highly inaccurate. 

having to tell siri to go away every time it‚Äôs used is simply unintuitive. the phrases it uses are immature at best. for example it will say ‚Äúuhh hu?‚Äù if you don‚Äôt speak fast enough. what in the california!?

siri is has become the substandard of virtual assistants. even pop culture continually rags on it.

apple seems to care so little that it‚Äôs not even listed on the product feedback page.
https://www.apple.com/feedback/

are they afraid of criticism? do they just not like their user base? or are they simply smug?
 
i‚Äôm assuming the latter considering they call their employees geniuses.

p.s. this was deleted from their user forum because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot constructive‚Äù. so maybe they are just afraid of criticism."
"can we get multi-monitor support? like great ux instead of random support? so i love display tech and i‚Äôm a software engineer. so every year i‚Äôm swapping out for a hopefully improved experience. 

i run two macbook pros and they share a dual monitor setup. so i‚Äôm intimately experiencing macos display support.

i‚Äôm seeing an abysmal experience with this setup. 

whenever i switch inputs the macbook never remembers the monitor arrangement and it must be manually set.

when inputs are switched from monitors the other macbook is still ‚Äúusing‚Äù the monitors. meaning that open applications are invisible. the mouse can scroll over to the right or left into invisible monitors which are no longer displaying this computer‚Äôs displays yet they still are shown to the os. 

can we get these issues fixed and create a premium experience for monitors?"
"[rant] customer service hung up on me when faced with a difficult issue - twice i‚Äôm curious if anyone has come across a similar situation recently, and if anyone has advice to not run into this issue moving forward. 

a couple days ago my phone (iphone 12 mini) stopped being able to connect with wi-fi. add to that cell towers in my area going down, my phone had no way to connect with the outside world. using my partners phone, i called apple care to try and diagnose the issue. the rep‚Äôs first suggestion was to reset and reinstall the ios. i asked multiple times if this would wipe my phone. i would have to back it up properly first if so, as i can‚Äôt lose valuable information on there. 

she emphatically said multiple times it would not. lo and behold, it did. as soon as i mentioned this, and was quite unhappy as we had directly discussed this, she stopped speaking. the line was open, i could hear ambient noise for about 3 minutes, then she hung up. i later found out she made no notes on the case either. 

just today, i had to call again about an issue with some apple software on my computer. it‚Äôs my primary work software, and the issue i was dealing with is very complex. after spending about 30 minutes on the phone with support, realizing we were going in circles and he wasn‚Äôt going to be able to help, i asked to speak with a supervisor or someone who might have more knowledge on such a niche (but very important) issue. 

similar to the first call, he went silent for a couple minutes, then hung up. i again found out in a subsequent call he didn‚Äôt take any notes about the call. 

has this happened with anyone else? very unhappy with this lack of professionalism and accountability."
"one device to rule them all with how far computing has come in the last 3 decades, why can‚Äôt we have a singular device that is able to handle a dual macos and ios?

it would certainly be better for the environment and consumers. what is stopping this from happening? corporate greed?"

"siri on apple tv vs ios i‚Äôve been seeing so many ‚Äúis siri getting dumber‚Äù posts. i agree that this is a concern, a big time one as many use digital assistants for the day to day. i am wondering if, at least partially, it‚Äôs because apple tries to keep a large amount of its operations on the phone itself as opposed to using the cloud exclusively, as well as not getting as much analytical data from users to improve the system. 

i know apple was caught a while back listening and keeping peoples audio without their consent, and i‚Äôm wondering if they were trying to get more data to improve siri, much like maybe alexa and google do/did?

has anyone else realized that siri on apple tv is faster and much better than on the iphone, at least for me? it‚Äôs actually a pleasure to use the siri remote compared to siri on the iphone. i wonder if the apple tv actually uses customer data to improve siri (at least for apple tv). i can‚Äôt speak to the homepod because i have not yet used one.

anyone agree with this at some level? or do you have any other things to add to this topic?"
"new 2023 - icloud won't allow your 4k uhd hdr raw video files to be downloaded rumour has gotten out that icloud has has a secret, but huge, downgrade.

you no longer can select an option to download your content (specifically 4k uhd) video and get all the features. 

if you download direct from the website you may notice all your videos are now in 720p, a huge downgrade from the raw data of 2160p.

a work around is to download the icloud desktop app and let it completely fill your local storage with your library.

this now means the videos download will be in 4k uhd and 60fps. however will lack hdr data from the file. 

i downloaded the same file about 2 months apart and, despite being intrigued by the apparent change to high efficiency, the file is missing additional content. these are the tags for the same file.

"""dark patterns"" on trade-in site omg i wish i'd checked here before my recent iphone upgrade purchase.  but apple generally has such great service i never dreamed they would screw me over like this.

i purchased online to replace my wife's phone, because no dealer in my area had what i wanted in stock. got the new phone fine.  and the trade-in process initially seemed excellent - estimated $160 for a 4 generations old phone, sent me a prepaid return box, all good.

then i get the ""revised value"" and it's $55 not $160.  no way i'm taking that, but they will send the phone back to me no charge.

here's where it gets ""dark"" though.  i *accidentally* clicked the ""accept"" button instead of ""reject"".  there is no ""are you sure?"" confirmation.  just ""thank you, you've accepted the offer"".   no recourse, nothing.

i *immediately* went to support.  online customer service can't help, but they take all my information and suggest i try the phone support line.  the phone support person is very nice, but even they cannot reverse the process. 

this is deliberately predatory design, first at the ui level, and second at the business process level."

i‚Äôve not experienced this when adding a screen to a laptop,, but for a desktop, it seems like there should be a clear and easy way to assign the displays, without it forgetting everytime you step away to make a coffee..
any help is much appreciated, been using this computer for under 2 weeks,, i‚Äôm contemplating just returning because this seems like such a basic thing to address, yet i can‚Äôt find a clear solution to lasts beyond a power cycle"

"people who recently switched to iphone, what do you miss the most? i was an apple user until 2015 when i switched from iphone 5 to the samsung galaxy series. since then i saw a lot of improvement with the limitation that ios had that i really disliked. i use the ipad pro m1 and the galaxy s10 plus. i consider switching to iphone 14 pro max (i would probably wait to the 15 just for the usb c).

i consider myself a ""power user"" and i already know that i will miss the ""split screen"" feature on my iphone, and also the fingerprint scanner. before i make that switch again i want to make sure that i know the limitation that i will have with ios, any people here who recently switched from android to ios?"

"i was today years old when i learned how warranty exchanges work with apple edit: i was at the \~2 hours away apple store to pick up an order, and in the area to visit family. i brought the defective magsafe duo with me to exchange, having checked to confirm the store had stock. i did not mean to give the impression that i drove there *only* to exchange the magsafe duo. i did not do my homework. no excuses for that. in my weak defence, i've never had to do homework on apple's processes before because they are typically so slick and seamless. i was just surprised i could not simply exchange the defective item for in-store stock, something that i would take for granted at best buy, home depot, or in a purely online environment, amazon.

edit 2: sounds like there may have been a break down in the process at the apple store. other people have reported different experiences in similar circumstances. e.g., they should have agreed to mail the device to me.

mini-rant. drove the \~2 hours to my nearest apple store to exchange my magsafe duo charger, the phone-side charger of which stopped working a couple weeks ago. the unit was still under warranty. despite a dozen or so magsafe chargers sitting right there on the shelf they could not give me one.

>""those ones are for sale.""

had to wait for a genius bar appointment. to submit my request. to have apple ship a replacement unit. back to the same store. the one that is \~2 hours away. they'll let me know when it arrives.

hands down one of the most monty python / seinfeld / curb your enthusiam skit worthy experiences i have ever had. hours later i am still thoroughly flabergasted.

"psa: icloud advanced protection can be enabled with opencore legacy devices just for anyone who's keen to turn on icloud advanced protection on their account, when i first tried to enable it i had 3 devices that needed to be updated before it could be enabled, and my mac mini (late 2012) with an error saying that the device couldn't be updated to the latest os and and had to be removed from my apple id before i could enable it.

what worked was updating the other devices, and then restarting the mac mini once it was on the latest venture update and then it wasn't a problem!

"why doesn't apple specify nand flash ssd configuration/speed why doesn't apple clarify the speed of the ssds that come in their computers? i feel it is a bit shady that we don't really know what we're buying.

the m2 macbook pro has now famously shipped with a single nand flash for the 256gb model meaning it is half the speed of the 256gb ssd in the original m1 macbook air unless you buy a 512gb model.

i have heard that now with the m2 mac mini, you won't get a dual nand configuration until the 2tb model.

if apple won't give all devices a dual nand config (2x128gb, 2x256gb, 2x512gb) i feel like they should at least specify the rated ssd speed of the device.

when you buy an ssd online you don't just cross your fingers and hope your getting a fast one."

it'll cut one or the other for a split second which causes the docked macbook to go to the lock screen (since it's closed and only stays logged in when it's connected to a monitor)

apple introduces the new homepod with breakthrough sound and intelligence 
"the new apple tv preview app for windows finally enables 4k hdr playback, including for apple tv+ before, you could only watch apple tv+ in your browser at 480p (not even 720p, because apple loves suffering). 


but the new preview app works really well so far for me. it is playing apple tv+ and my past itunes movie purchases in full 4k quality, and it looks great. hdr is available if your setup is capable. 


here's the link: https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/apple-tv-preview/9nm4t8b9jqz1


**caution: after installing the preview, itunes will no longer open, and downloaded audiobooks or podcasts on will be inaccessible. to revert back to itunes, you must uninstall the preview app.**"
"apple id issues hi all, very long post, tl;dr at bottom. 

on november 24th of 2022 i was sitting down with my family to watch the charlie brown thanksgiving special on appletv. i logged into apple tv in browser on my windows machine (which is hooked up to the ‚Äútv‚Äù). it said i‚Äôd receive a prompt to authenticate with my iphone. 

on my iphone i received a prompt that someone in <a major city within a (long) days drive of me> was trying to access my account. now, i know these things don‚Äôt always tell you the city you actually live in, especially when it‚Äôs actually pretty rural, so i assumed this was myself and hit accept. it then gave me a 6 digit pin to put in on apple tv website, which i did, and we watched the show. 

later that evening i found out while checking my email that my apple id password had been reset. i realized i may have accidentally authenticated someone that wasn‚Äôt supposed to have access to the account, so i quickly attempted to reset my password thru the settings app on my iphone. i was told my apple id was locked for security reasons, and to visit iforgot.apple.com to reset the password. 

on this website it asked for my apple id email and associated phone number, which i provided. fortunately, it seems the phone number hadn‚Äôt yet been changed because it seemed to work. i was told i‚Äôd receive a text in 24 hours to reset my password.  i was like ‚Äúok that‚Äôs not ideal, but i can work with that. i‚Äôd rather not loose my account.‚Äù

now, for background reference, i am a student right now. i do have a part time job that pays ok, but the economy has been real shitty lately, so i have taken up doordash and uber to try to keep putting money into savings for my future. 

aside from the aforementioned windows machine, my only other devices are an old macbook pro, and an ipad mini (i believe 2nd generation but i don‚Äôt know for sure, it was a gift). i require both of these devices to do my schoolwork. 

anyways, back to iforgot, after the 24 hour waiting period, i didn‚Äôt receive any text or email or anything, but i went back to the website and they told me i‚Äôd need to wait something like 2 weeks (13 days or so) to reset my password. at this point i was miffed. my income and my grades were dependent on having my devices functioning, but given the point in the semester i sucked it up and said ‚Äúok, fine. small price to pay for not loosing my accounts right? i‚Äôll just not by any more christmas presents, and work out some plea deals with my professors.‚Äù 

a couple days into this two week period, i log into iforgot to check the status, and it says i can reset my password on my mac. i‚Äôm thinking this is great, way faster than the 2 weeks i was expecting. i open up my macbook and wait for the notification to pop up. it never does. i try running the iforgot steps again (account email, phone number, etc) and still nothing on my mac. the iforgot website says i should be receiving a notification, but it never arrives. 

i tried again to tell it i needed to reset my password and it threw me into another 24 hour waiting period. i waited thru this period, where i was told i‚Äôd receive a message after 24 hours to reset my password. no such message arrived, and logging into iforgot again, it told me i needed to wait another two weeks.  i should also add that on this screen it says that ‚Äúapple support cannot shorten the wait time.‚Äù so now i‚Äôm pretty frustrated, but i don‚Äôt see what else i can do but wait. 

guess what? a couple days later iforgot has the same message about resetting my password on my mac, and repeats the above, i log in, receive no notifications, and the iforgot countdown timer is gone again. 

so i call up apple support at this point because clearly something is going wrong. the first tech i speak with tells me that i need to shut down and leave powered down any devices except the one i want to reset the password with. now i will note, nowhere on the iforgot website does it tell you this, but according to the tech support guy, if the system sees my other devices logged in, it‚Äôll kick me out of the reset process. 

he has me try a couple other methods of reset on each of my devices, none of them working or course. at the end he tells me i‚Äôm just gonna have to wait for the password reset program on iforgot to run its course. he closes my ticket and, a couple days later (after finals and stuff) i attempt, again, to reset my password. 

this time i turned off all my apple devices, save my phone, which the apple support tech *assured* me was allowed to stay on. 

at this point i think you can guess how this went. 24 hour waiting period with the promise of a text or email. no such text or email. 2 week waiting period, which after a couple days, tells me to use my mac to reset the password, i try, but never receive any notification on my mac. 

at this point i‚Äôm into christmas break, and have had no access to my account for nearly a month. i called apple support again, and was asked to try basically all of the above again. then they passed me up the chain to a ‚Äúsenior support tech‚Äù or something like that. this woman, i forget her name, was very kind and understanding, but not at all helpful. she asked me to walk her through everything we tried, and had me try a couple other things (like resetting thru a friends iphone using the apple support app) all to no avail. after several hours on the phone, she tells me it could be an issue with the iforgot security system, but to figure out what it could be we‚Äôd need to run another attempt at password reset with the iforgot system. she tells me that i may not receive anything at 24 hours, even tho i should, but to check it every day, and to use an emailed hyperlink to get in touch with her as soon as i notice the iforgot system has kicked me out of the reset process. 

so we start the process again, and low and behold, 24 hours, no notifications, two weeks hold, and a couple days in it tells me to use my mac to reset (the mac that has been powered off for nearly two weeks at this point, along with my ipad).  as soon as this happens, i open up my email to get in touch with the senior support lady, and lo and behold, the hyperlink she gave me to get in contact requires me to log in with my apple id to function. the apple id that is currently locked for security reasons. 

so seeing no other option, i called back apple support *again* and was put thru all the above paces again, was handed off to a new senior support guy named something like dave or david or something, and he tells me all the same things, has me try all the same things as nice support staff lady, although he‚Äôs very grouchy the entire time. 

i think you can guess at this point. 24 hours. two weeks. a couple days later i‚Äôm booted from the reset. dave only provided the email link that requires apple id to get in touch. i call apple support again, walk the first guy through it again, and am passed up the chain again, this time to a guy named ralph or something like that. 

i should also interject here, that during this entire time i have not been able to do most of the work i normally do to bring in my income, because doordash and uber have had app updates that are required, but i cannot update, because my apple id is locked. so not only am i out my account, and all of its purchases, i‚Äôm also out one of my primary income streams now too, and at this point it‚Äôs after christmas. i have been locked out for over a month and unable to do anything about it. 

ralph tells me that it‚Äôs possible there is some other problem going on that is unforeseen. he asks me to try the iforgot process again, and to let him know when it kicks me out again. and thank god when i bring up that the hyperlink apple support thing won‚Äôt work because my apple id is locked, he says, ‚Äúoh good point, i‚Äôll give you an email you can respond to via email, as well as my office hours.‚Äù 

over new year‚Äôs eve weekend, we try again, 24 hours, two weeks, kicked out, i send him an email, wait a couple days and get a call. he tells me that it‚Äôs possible there‚Äôs some other devices out there that are logged in with my apple id that are booting me from the process. i think about it for a while and am fairly certain that i‚Äôve done my due diligence and that none of my friends or family had my apple id logged in. 

he says it can even be things i wouldn‚Äôt think about like a watch or apple tv. i hadn‚Äôt thought of the apple tv before, but my parents (who live two times zones away) have an apple tv. ralph says he‚Äôs going to escalate my case to the apple engineers to hopefully get this sorted out. 

i call my mom, she double checks the apple tv, and i am not logged in on it. haven‚Äôt been for ‚Äúmonths or years‚Äù according to her. my dad verifies as well a few days later. i let ralph know this by email, he says thanks and that he‚Äôs still waiting to hear from the engineers. a couple days go by and what i get back from ralph and the engineers is basically, ‚Äúoh yeah it looks like one of your devices was still active and is getting you kicked out, but for security reasons we can‚Äôt tell you which one. better double check them all and try again.‚Äù 

at this point by the tone of, and increasing time between, ralph‚Äôs emails i can tell he is getting exasperated by me and or my case. i am also pretty much hopeless at this point. i have had my ipad and macbook powered off all year, all my friends and family have confirmed not a single device is logged in with my apple id, which should leave just my 3: iphone, ipad, macbook pro. the last two of which *have been off all year*. 

ralph has me try the iforgot system again (resetting thru the settings app on my phone), and as i am sure you know to expect at this point: 24 hours. two weeks. use your mac. no notifications. booted out of the system again. 

at some point in the last 2 ish weeks i asked ralph what would happen if someone had compromised the account and actually gotten a device logged in and set up with my id. he said, in a nutshell, ‚Äúwell that would suck, you‚Äôd have to wait for them to stop using your apple id. cuz any time you try the reset process, if anyone is using or even has powered on a device with your apple id logged in on it, it‚Äôs going to kick you out of the reset process. which is unfortunate, but there is nothing i can do about that.‚Äù 

the last i heard from ralph at this point is the message about my devices ‚Äúnot all being logged off and i should please double check‚Äù (they have all been off since before new years). that email was a week ago and i‚Äôm beginning to wonder if there‚Äôs nothing that can be done for my account. 

i am nearing the 2 month mark since this whole ordeal began, and i‚Äôm pretty hopeless. i have had to take extra shifts at work to make up some of the lost income from not being able to dash and uber, and i haven‚Äôt had access to any of my music or movies that i had spent years accumulating. apple support has been completely unhelpful. i don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. 

is there anyone who‚Äôs experienced similar issues? is there any way for me to ever get my account back? i‚Äôd take any and all suggestions at this point. 

thanks for your time. 

tl;dr, apple id was probably compromised back in november and the password reset has been failing for 2 months straight. apple support has been completely useless and not helped anything."

there was a thread on this topic a year ago. it was basically a list of things it could be used for, mentions of photoshop/finalcut and references to faceid on phones.

as a desktop user, this feature seems like potential more than product. a larger gpu seems more useful for me personally but im curious if i am missing something that has actually been implemented.

if there are no uses, i wish they would stop talking about it. if they are going to promote it so much, they ought to better explain what it actually does.

but my friend moved from android to ios one month ago and he complained about bluetooth connectivity constantly failing on him. 

i feel this is particularly bad given that the airpods should be seamlessly integrated with the apple devices, yet these too fail in rapidly connecting to it's host device.

"why do old iphone and ipads have storage engraved on their shell? like in here: https://imgur.com/a/hso4e5s

it's somewhat interesting to me that a company which doesn't promotes technical specification in their ads and doesn't like putting (processor) sticker on their macbooks, writes storage capacity.

one might think ipad comes in various models, ususally depicted and differentiated by the storage capacity they hold. but ipad could also have cellular capability which they don't mention."
"always hitting period key instead of space when typing on safari. this.needs.to.be.fixed. how many others are frustrated by this? i find it very poor design by apple to change the keyboard configuration when using safari. i get that you need the period key more to type in a url. however every time i‚Äôm trying to type in a search on safari i end up hitting the period key instead of the space bar so all of my searches.come.out.looking.like.this. 

i think many of us are so used to the keyboard we don‚Äôt need to look at it when typing. for years now i‚Äôve never been able to remember that when you are in safari the keyboard layout slightly changes. 

i wish apple would just give the option to disable this infuriating keyboard feature."

on more than 7 occasions now, in recent weeks, i have marked my 8am medications as ‚Äútaken‚Äù at 7:55am or thereabouts (ie just earlier than 8am), and have then been alerted at 8am by the other device to take my 8am medications. all devices connected to a network, usually wifi, and otherwise working fine. apple watch is also cellular.

this is a recent trend. didn‚Äôt happen a few weeks ago.

this is dangerous, as overdoses of some prescription medications can be severe."

i'm not telling you to turn off this safety setting, but i urge you to consider when it will and won't be helpful to you. ;)

crash detection is on by default on all iphone 14's, and apple watch series 8, ultra, and 2nd generation se. the feature may be rolled out for older phones and watches as well with software updates. in addition to calling 911 after detecting a crash (or ""crash""), it may notify your emergency contacts by text message including live updates with your gps location, depending on your settings.

this setting can be enabled/disabled by going to settings -> emergency sos -> call after severe crash

thank you for your consideration!"
"did apple just stop proxying certain sites through icloud private relay? after the ipados 16.2 update was released in december 2022, i‚Äôve noticed that when visiting some sites on my ipads, the ""show/hide ip address"" option would disappear, and the website notably takes a different time to load (it's usually faster compared to other websites). this started with [apple.com](https://apple.com),  and now expanded to the following:

[twitter.com](https://twitter.com)

[web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com)

\*.youtube.com

[netflix.com](https://netflix.com)

[disneyplus.com](https://disneyplus.com)

i have turned off and on private relay which does not fix this issue, and have used 2 ipads and safari on macos and all seems to exhibit the same issue.

"i made an app that creates music playlists using ai (apple music and spotify) hey i'm a solo developer and released an app that lets you make a music playlist from a text prompt. similar to text-to-image ai, this is text-to-playlist. you can enter something like ""pop artists in the early 2000's"", ""chill electronic coding music"", or ""music similar to the artist taylor swift"". whatever you can think of.

there are other ways to make playlists too:

**images** \- upload a picture of a music festival poster (or other image with artist names on it) and it uses apple's image recognition to create a playlist of the artists in the image

**videos** \- upload a video, like a tiktok, that has multiple songs in it and it uses shazam to collect the songs into a playlist.

in the future i plan on making more ways to create playlists and refining the ai. this is a 1.0 release of the ai, it isn't perfect, but it generally does pretty well.

"who misses the apple watch edition (titanium version that was replaced by the current aw ultra)? i have a apple watch series 6 edition for over 2 years and its the best $1k i have ever spent with it being the only apple device i have not filed a apple care + claim on. it‚Äôs the titanium version in which i really enjoyed. i beat the living crap out of this thing and its still going strong, while appearing indistinguishable from the basic apple watch. it also actually looks good on my wrist. recently i learned that the apple watch edition was discontinued in favor of the apple watch ultra. i was actually pretty pissed considering that i don‚Äôt need everything that the ultra has to offer, but yet if i want to upgrade in the future i actually will have to chose between the ultra or the stainless steel. better yet it appears too big for my wrist.

for those who owned/owns an apple watch edition. what would be your plan should time come that you would be due for a upgrade? 

go back to traditional watches? get the ultra? downgrade to stainless steel version? or go watch less?

what are your thoughts on the product change?"

"pdfgear for mac - an easy and free pdf program hi everyone. i‚Äôm gordon, the developer of [pdfgear](https://www.pdfgear.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post20230116), which could handle pdfs with easier operations¬†on mac¬†for free. i‚Äôve¬†tried most of the popular pdf programs on the market and found that either the prices are too high,¬†the interfaces are too complicated to use, or converters not supported. so i started to create my own project to process pdf documents, and here pdfgear comes. 

pdfgear is an easy and free program, and most of the functions needed in pdfs are included:

* view pdfs for sure
* annotate pdfs with highlight, underline, and strikethrough with customized color
* write or draw on pdfs freely
* insert shapes at the place you want
* add notes and text boxes
* fill out forms with complete tools, including text insert, checkmark, cross mark, radio button

you could download [pdfgear](https://www.pdfgear.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post20230116) here.

as a free program, some users might be interested in how to make money with pdfgear. intending to bring pdfgear to more users and help handle pdfs easier, monetization is off the table for now. as for the future, some of the advanced features might be charged. but that‚Äôs just a hypothetical consideration, and i‚Äôm focusing on developing pdfgear as a better solution for pdf processing at the current stage. so i wish to get your feedback no matter it is a suggestion or a compliment!

thanks in advance!"
"refurb mac studio ""lost"" in transit to apple store - where/how do i escalate this? tl;dr - ups has a proof of delivery of a refurb mac studio to an apple store, apple store says they don't have it. i'm feeling stuck between the finger-pointing (apple says file a claim with ups), and need suggestions on how to escalate as i simply want the mac studio i ordered. what should i do now?

**update**
* first thank you to everyone who replied! today the unit was found somewhere in/about/near the retail store. 
* i had escalated on both fronts including a claim with ups that rejected it with ""contact sender first and create a sem case"" + apple number
* the retail store implied the problem occurred because i ""changed my ship-to address to that the retail store"" which was certainly not the case - i just selected the ship-to-store option/process. that said, my name appeared above ""apple pacific centre"" in the shipping address, but i have no idea why they fumbled/lost it. 
* i suspect the fact this unit was a refurbishment and shipped from elk grove california it may have gotten some manual attention. through this journey i've learned more of the process than i cared for, but do want to send my appreciation to ryan at the vancouver retail store for being kind/professional and helpful throughout.

----------
details:
i ordered a mac studio refurb g14k6ll and chose ‚Äúin-store pickup‚Äù to be safe. a day later i received an invoice/shipped notice and my cc was charged - all seemed well. 

late the day of supposed pick-up (friday 13th), i called apple and was told ""it's at the store"" and noted that i've not received a pickup notice. they transferred me to the store and was told ""no we don't have it in the pos, but call back tomorrow after 10am"". 

i followed-up late the following day via the same process, and this time the call centre shared the ups tracking # and proof of delivery to the store. was transferred to the store again who with the s/n ""went line-by-line"" by their delivery manifest"" to confirm the didn't have it. 

the apple store suggested ""i file a claim with ups"", but is it really my responsibility to do so? i just want my mac studio. i see where this headed - a long investigation and dispute; and i wondered if someone could share further ideas that may help.

thanks!"
"apple, it's time to make sync smarter. there have been many attempts over the years to reduce network load, from macos server caching updates for ios devices, through to itunes sync over wifi. but now with many icloud sync, apple don't appear to have made any attempts at making this ""smarter"".

depending on your sync goals, there's one glaring flaw with using a portable device on battery to record content that is cloud synced, it inevitably pauses sync until the device is plugged in, whether you're out on the street, or at home, it won't matter. and it's during this time that if something goes wrong with the device the content is lost.

isn't it about time that sync was introduced as a service on all devices/os' so that when a device is on battery, but on the same network as another device (which is configured to sync the same content), it will then regardless of corded state, sync that new content to the other device via bluetooth/wifi (as appropriate). this serves to ensure that content is securely recorded in at least two locations, it reduces internet bandwidth/load, and is much more timely than double hopping all the devices up to the cloud and back down. the development logistics would be somewhat less complicated than developing an entirely new system beyond introducing ""receive"" sync capabilities on os' ... from there they can either use network discovery, or a cloud based public/private ip matching system (that is, when a device contacts the sync server, it records the public ip, and if the private ip subnet matches with another device, then sync is directed to the local device and not the internet).

the ultimate goal is to make sync more timely and more reliable using the local network where possible to ensure content is in multiple locations, especially if one of those locations is a corded device (e.g. imac, etc).

now, if this is meant to be already implemented and working, then i have absolutely no idea of determining if it's working or not because i have many gigs worth of video on my phone sitting on the desk next to my imac with sync paused because ""reasons"" ..."
"üå™Ô∏è introducing tornado s3 sync üëã howdy, folks! i hope everyone is having an excellent sunday. recently, i released [tornado s3 sync](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344) for macos ventura.

[you can download it here!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344)

a couple of months ago i faced a problem:

**i needed a way to reliably sync the local files on my macbook to my personal amazon s3 bucket.**

i tried other solutions but they were all either too bloated with other file transfer protocols (sftp, scp, etc.), had ambiguous at best data collection policies, or had such a gnarly configuration ui that the thought of ever having to go back into those settings menus sent me running for the hills. all i wanted was an easy to use and configure menubar app to sync my files.

this was the genesis for my first ever macos app, [**tornado s3 sync**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344).

built entirely in swiftui, tornado s3 sync offers users a simple way to reliably backup your mac's files to your personal amazon s3 bucket. below are some of the features that tornado s3 sync offers:

* **secure syncs** - tornado s3 sync makes secure api calls to amazon's published s3 rest apis
* **observability** - tornado s3 sync can notify you of in progress, successful, or failed s3 sync actions
* **set and forget** - once you've configured tornado s3 sync to your liking, you can have peace of mind knowing that your files are syncing on the interval of your choosing
* **absolutely zero data collection** - tornado s3 sync **does not** collect any data about you, your local client, or anything that you send to amazon.
* **no in-app purchases or subscriptions** - i hate subscriptions as much as anyone, which is why tornado s3 sync is a one-time purchase with no in-app purchases or subscriptions.

and that's it! tornado s3 sync is exceptionally uncomplicated, and is, in my very biased opinion, the easiest way to get your files backed up from your mac to your amazon s3 bucket.

as an added bonus, i have 10 promo codes to give away to the first 10 users that dm me!

thank you all, and happy syncing!"

"if you're a terminal user and find moving things around painful, there's an app for that - clipboard! [get clipboard here](https://github.com/slackadays/clipboard)

when i started out making clipboard, i did so because i found it was painful to do certain things in the terminal like copying a file when i didn't know where i wanted to put it. or maybe it was too slow to type out some long path and hope you got it right in a copy command. or, maybe i needed to copy a file from the terminal and paste it in a browser. either way, i was stuck in a pickle and found myself wasting time and effort.

clipboard changes all of this. i designed it to have a user experience light years ahead of `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` so that any user could get started right away. additionally, you can actually copy real, honest-to-goodness files now instead of just text! best of all, the clipboard app is free and open-source.

i hope you all find clipboard useful :)"

"it's just not fair. [app store reviews] i am outraged by the fact that apple only shows app ratings and reviews in the app store by region.

when i want to read people's reviews about this or that application, i often come across the ""no one left reviews and ratings, so we won't show you anything at all"" situation.

https://imgur.com/h6ck7gi

i moved to a country that apparently has few people with iphones or few people who are interested in well-known applications.

ok. why doesn't app store have country/language filters? i want to know what people write all over the world but i don't have that opportunity.

in steam, for example, very conveniently implemented filters by language and all information is available. few reviews in your native language? you can see reviews from people all over the world! and decide whether to buy the game or not.

this is sorely lacking in the app store and i feel it's unfair that the company doesn't allow me to learn more about the app through reviews and ratings from users around the world."

"getting rid of the airport line seems pretty dumb in retrospect i was never really an airport superfan, but i did like it. when it was discontinued i moved on. looking back on it though, i really think this was a dumb discontinuation on apple's part. there are a lot of examples of beloved and discontinued products whose fans continue to miss them long after they're gone (think google reader). in a lot of these cases, the product in question had a really strong use case for a certain set, but was not economically viable for the business to maintain or make money off of.

but for apple, and their set of home devices (not to mention homekit), just seems like a big misstep to lose this critical part of people's home networks.

\- airport could easily tie into apple's messaging about privacy and include privacy features that are easy to activate and use.

\- airport could act as a home hub for people who don't have an apple tv, or other product. 

\- airport could act as a ""homekit router"" instead of having to rely exclusively on third party products.

\- airport brand and/or technology could be (if apple wanted), integrated into other products. i.e., maybe you can have a homepod that also has an airport router built in, or macmini with router capabilities. (not saying they should have done this, but they could have had the option).

\- apple could have done this with an existing product line, that they wouldn't have had to build from scratch. it was already there, people already liked it. maybe it wouldn't be a huge profit driver but certainly supports the ecosystem at home. 

\- ongoing support for features like time machine backup.

while i'm not saying that any one of these ideas would have been a great use case (i'm not an apple engineer), i am saying that there would be plenty of opportunities for innovation with an apple router in people's homes.

at the time airport was discontinued, it was kind of at the nadir of apple's hardware development (in my opinion). butterfly keyboards, limited ports, etc. but apple has largely been able to recover/adjust course on those missteps. 

the airport line seems like another story entirely. just a huge mistake and missed opportunity for apple to support a key component of people's home internet. not a great move, and i think their home strategy is suffering as a result."

"ulti-planner calendar for ios is now released. we think we have a best-in-class contender for your scheduling needs.  

hey¬†[r/apple](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/)

just wanted to let people know about our new app. with over 1200 new development hours and over 3 years in beta, we have taken our older best selling app's code base and completely rewritten it to be faster, cleaner, lightweight and more reliable to create a new experience on iphone and ipad. this may be one of the most mature and full featured version 1.0 apps you will ever find.

the app features 8 calendar views with a ton of customizations and a new card based ui. other features include calendar text, drag-n-drop, advanced reminders, weather, custom view filters, icons, hashtags, and embedded event lists ... and a few more are cut-n-paste, templates, meeting handling, natural language, and widgets. and...

i think you'll love just how customizable the app is. no more living with a 'red' calendar with a bunch of dots. you can customize the app in a bunch of colors in both light and dark mode, or change to a completely different solid color. and the month view alone has 8 different formats to choose from including text, icons, time bars, or dots.

so please give it a try and see if it can replace your calendar. the basic free version is what a lot of people want, a simple month calendar with calendar text and widgets. and then premium adds all of the advanced views including a new timeline day view along with reminders, weather, icons, hashtags, and quick entry options. you can try that out for 14 days before deciding and our price point is way below similar apps.

thank you!

"dynamic head tracking spatial audio on video players in safari? solved: call me dumb for posting before trying this but- restarting my macbook fixed it. usually i would try trivial troubleshooting steps like this, but with airpods pro 2 and an m2 macbook? it never crossed my mind that it would be a bug/glitch, i totally assumed everything would just \*work\* so i jumped to other, more complex potential issues like ""maybe only certain youtube videos allow spatial audio/head tracking, maybe there's a setting i have to enable in the music app"" etc. never thought it could be as dumb as ""turn off and back on"" because i expected the apple magic to rule that out from the get-go. anyway, if you're having this specific issue and stuble upon this post- it's the only post about this issue out there as far as i could tell: restart your mac. spatial audio/head tracking absolutely does work everywhere, whether youtube, netflix, iplayer, or whatever else: i can confirm it is supposed to work, even if the content isn't specifically mixed for dolby atmos/surround/spatial audio, it will work, just won't be the fullest experience vs content which is mixed with these things in mind.

&#x200b;

\---redundant original post below---

i'm enjoying testing this out with music, but i feel like it'll be a better experience watching a video or show or whatever. with airpods pro 2, i've tried several youtube videos, and a show on iplayer (uk tv catch-up streaming service for us ppl so it has regular tv shows on it like netflix pretty much). i can enable spatial audio, i hear it enable because of the brief pause, and i can hear the clear before and after, but if i go a step further and try to enable head tracking, nothing changes, it stays the same sa regular spatial audio. i have read many accounts of people using head tracking to watch youtube, tv shows, movies etc, and i've been through all the settings etc to check if i'm missing something, but everything seems right, it seems like it *should* just work.

can't find any clear answers on google beyond people saying they do use head tracking for these things. has anyone else mananged to use head tracking on iplayer? and as for youtube, is it only certain videos that support it? if anyone has any idea what the deal is, would appreciate your input!

i've only tried it with music but i'm eager to try it for video, movies etc, i was sure it would work on iplayer, being actual tv shows but yeah, still no luck... and i don't really see the point in regular spatial audio, it *kind of* enhances how it sounds  a bit..? i guess..? but i don't really get the same surround effect as with head tracking, even if i barely move my head, just inadvertent micro-movements seems to enrich the 3d effect so much.

&#x200b;

anyway yeah, hopefully can figure this out. thank you!"
"how do i prevent camera recordings from bouncing between lenses? when the zoom jumps under 1.0 the image gets really grainy and choppy. i posted on r/iphone and the mods removed my post. i‚Äôm just looking for some help because i don‚Äôt like how easy it is to jump under 1.0 zoom while recording a video. i like how it used to be before ios 16 where the wide angle lens was locked out during recording unless you started your recording with that lens.

i just have waze up to alert me to any hazards or speed traps. my car was in the shop so i was driving my wife‚Äôs car all day yesterday. her car does not have carplay, so i had my phone mounted on the dash. i was using waze, like i usually do, and holy advertisements, batman. 

literally every two or three minutes an ad would pop up on waze. i had no idea that this was even a thing with waze because i only ever use carplay, and i guess carplay doesn‚Äôt let waze show those ads. but as soon as i was viewing waze not in carplay it was like the wild west. 

so thank you, carplay, for making me blissfully unaware for years now that waze shows huge ads that take up 1/3 of the screen and you have to unsafely look at your phone and swipe them away."
"macbook m1/m2 experiencing issues on enterprise networks we've noticed multiple macbook m1/m2 users experiencing network issues when working on enterprise sized networks.

it seems to originate from issues with awdl (apple wireless direct link) but this was supposed to be fixed with the launch of ventura 13.1.

is anyone else still experiencing issues with this or were you able to resolve it? if so, how?  


  
update:  
i'm sorry, i realized in hindsight i was incredibly vague in my description.

we found this article  [https://www.meter.com/mac-osx-awdl-psa](https://www.meter.com/mac-osx-awdl-psa) from meter that described the exact symptoms we had.

we asked users to try disabling awdl and update to the latest os however it has had mixed results, some seeing improvements and some not.  


however thanks a lot for answering even though i provided barely any information.

"what‚Äôs the point of freeform on ios? just downloaded ios 16.2 to see a new app called freeform.

it appears to be a slightly souped up version of notes but not as good. why has apple included it on a phone?

i can sort of see why it works on a computer/tablet but not on a phone (unless you want to see what you‚Äôve done on a computer).

why do you think apple included it?"
"what do you think is better? ios or macos.
i‚Äôve been thinking as to why i feel odd with my tablet, and i think it‚Äôs the operating system!
it‚Äôs just a big-screened phone! i mean, the only reason why i had the ipad int he first placed was because i thought it could be a professional drawing tablet with some perks!

but i still wanna use the web normally on my tablet as i do with my pc, but a browser on ios is like a chimp with a machine gun! you need to get apps to get reddit to work, or it plays like shit!

it‚Äôs just consistency that i have a problem with between devices, that and the fact that i need to download an app instead of just hopping onto a website, which is odd,  because what if i wanna watch multiple youtube videos at once!

"keynote: export to html = wow i work in an office where i have to create presentations for meetings. i have an imac and have always used keynote. i've tried powerpoint this past year and trying to do things i can do in keynote is ridiculously complicated.

recently, our ceo switched to a pc laptop from a macbook pro (for remote connect things), so i thought i was stuck with having to move to powerpoint. *(sadtrombone.mp3)* however, i noticed an export feature today in keynote called ""export to html."" i gave it a shot and am i impressed!

it creates a folder and inside it's got index.html and a folder for your assets. double click the html file and there's your presentation. transitions, effects, everything. granted, a few transitions like cube did go wonky but corrected itself. works on every browser i've thrown at it too (both mac and pc, though i didn't try edge).

i'm not sure how long this feature has been available but i am extremely impressed with it. hopefully more people can use this as a workaround to avoid powerpoint.

edit: i forgot to mention if you hover your mouse on the left side of the screen, it brings up your slides so you can jump to a slide if you need to."

for me, it‚Äôs nothing really against android, it‚Äôs just i don‚Äôt need the customization, i barely use my phone anyhow, i just need a semi-modern phone to keep in contact with friends and family and occasionally look stuff up on the net and listen to podcasts on road trips. i just happen to choose an iphone nothing more. my laptop is seven years old dell, and i simply don‚Äôt care to upgrade as i use it for browsing reddit, and paying bills online, casual browsing, nothing crazy,

"apple killing dark sky for their own far less accurate weather app is infuriating. dark sky was the most useful and accurate weather app i had ever used. it legitimately is one of those apps that made my life better. apple‚Äôs weather app is a joke when it comes to accuracy.

ex: right now i have heavy snow (dark sky agrees) the apple app says it‚Äôs drizzling.

there have been so many instances like this and i‚Äôm really sad to see dark sky go down at the end of the year.

rip

it makes me sad that this was done and i know it will happen again to other apps in the future.

edit: for those recommending carrot i‚Äôm gonna spread some knowledge here. [please don‚Äôt use carrot + accuweather](https://www.reddit.com/r/tropicalweather/comments/9nlucs/just_a_reminder_that_accuweather_is_an_awful/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). this is one of the reasons i am really going to miss dark sky. it was a pay once and you got plenty of what your tax dollars paid for. the more fair and non sleazy options consumers have here the better.

edit 2: it seems like i freaked a few people out. sorry didn‚Äôt monitor this post the best. but apple is supposedly integrating dark sky into their app. it doesn‚Äôt seem, however, that they have done it nearly as well as many would have hoped so far. my wife and i also get the different weather conditions for the same location thing regularly (chicago subs)."
"why it's ok for the iphone to be this heavy used to be an iphone user then switched to android phones for a while then ordered the 14 pro max because of the good reviews, received it yesterday and i was shocked. how is it ok for a phone to be this ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable to hold and use ? i even went to the store today and tried the 14 pro and still it's heavy, the 14 plus was way more comfortable. phones are supposed to be comfortable to hold and use so how is the 14 pro and 14 pro max aren't talked about as design fail by apple ? you would think a company with apple resources can use lighter materials or manage better weight distribution."

"applecare plus replacement iphone no questions asked not actually no questions asked? so i had two iphone 12 pro max with extended apple care purchased on both purchased when they came out. in every year and model of iphone that i have owned, i never opted for applecare plus because i thought it was a waste of money as i always upgraded every year. however this time i skipped the 13 and opted for the 14.

when getting my 12‚Äôs two years ago, the rep told me it‚Äôs no questions asked replacements with the plus. i planned on giving these two iphones 12‚Äôs to my parents because i upgraded to the 14 on both. the first 12 was severley damaged - main tings were: broken camera lens and then eventually broken back glass. i made an appointment for this iphone, where they told me they had to send it back to apple to check it. i believe they wanted to verify if there were third party parts in there. a week later i got that iphone replaced. when i went to go pick it up i asked if i could do the same for the second one and she said that it‚Äôs not no questions asked replacement and told me they will always repair it if possible‚Ä¶ the second one isn‚Äôt as damaged, it only has cosmetic damage to the sides. 

but now i feel duped. if this was the case i wouldn‚Äôt have purchased the extra apple care. because i was careless with it due to the warranty. is there any advice on how to get it replaced or am i sol and supposed to have all the cosmetic damages?"

"how is the translate app this bad? i have no comment on the quality of the translations. but this is the most obtuse and unresponsive app i‚Äôve ever used. there is no option to switch the languages you are translating (so for example if i am translating english to spanish, there is no button to swap it to spanish to english) which is simply stubborn and lazy.

however, the far worse part is that even after i clunk through their slow and ugly menus to manually change the languages, 90% of the time it won‚Äôt actually switch the translation!! even if i force close the app and reopen it, it is totally unresponsive and won‚Äôt switch languages.

"apple should support icloud drive backups to time machine bluf/tldr: apple should make time machine capable of keeping local backups of data that has been offloaded from your device due to icloud drive's optimize storage option.

apple has time machine to support local backups.

apple offers optimize storage with icloud drive for those who have limited local hard drive space.

unfortunately, any files macos decides to not keep locally due to optimize storage will also not get backed up to time machine nor other backup solutions that i'm aware of thus reducing those files offloaded to icloud in a ""one copy state"" and at risk of data loss that can be caused by a multitude of things including user error.  also changes made to those files on other devices will never make it to time machine unless you access that file on the mac connected to time machine causing macos to download the file again.

i understand there are folks who have data caps and can not spare the possible excessive data movement which could be caused by such a system but i'd love to see apple offer an option to get around this.

just give us an option, along with a warning that the feature could cause excessive data usage, where time machine can temporarily download a file from icloud drive to back it up then remove the temp file.  it would only need to do this once for the most part as any files you are actively changing after that point would be downloaded anyway.  for files modified on other devices icloud could use a modified tag just like local incremental backups use so time machine could grab the most recent update for backup.

i dunno, i know this is full on tldr material for a lot of folks but i'd love if i could get more people to think about this and maybe the community can start giving some pressure that apple could eventually respond to.  i'm going to submit my suggestions to apple but one dude ain't going to change the flow of apples development."

"dont trust icloud with your data! (lost many files) first of all i know that its kinda my fault for storing all of my documents only in icloud but i somehow trusted apple to keep my data safe after an old harddrive broke and i didn't wanna get my own nas system.

two days ago i realized that almost 900gigabytes of my data in icloud was just gone.   
all folders were still there, only the files in the folders were missing.

i immediately  looked into my ""recently deleted"" folder in icloud but there were no file in there.

since i didn't know when or how my files were removed from my icloud (which only i have access to) i contacted apples support.

the apple support told me to go to [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) and try the ""data recovery"" thing on the bottom of the site.

the ""restore files"" thing on [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) found 5000 deleted files that were to be permanently deleted in 2 days. so i instantly got to restoring those files. the website wasnt made to restore many files at once tho, so i had to restore them in packs of around 100files.   
every time i reloaded the website the counter went back up to 5000 since there were much more than 5000 deleted files on my account.

after 2 days of almost continuous file restoration i was finally done...  
but most of my files, especially the important ones were still missing...

the (very nice) person from the apple support created a high priority ticket for the technicians in america to look at my case and get my files back.

sadly the support rep called me a few minutes ago with the information that the techs finished the restoration... which by itself would be great news if not almost all of my files were still missing.

&#x200b;

so to sum it all up, i was stupid and trusted apple that icloud is a safe place to keep my data and now have lost more than 900gigs of photos, memories, documents and have no way of recovering them. (state registration card, purchase contract of my car,  rental contract of my flat, childhood photos, photos/memories of deceased relatives, all of my programming work from school, and so on)

so please always save your important files in multiple places and don't trust big companies to keep your data safe.

&#x200b;

(they should definitely add the feature that onedrive already has which sends you a notification if large amounts of data got deleted from your cloud storage)"

iphone 15 usb-c accessories to have limited data and charging speeds without apple's mfi certification 
"what could apple do differently for icloud password resets there's been many recent conversations about the impact of a thief taking your phone and knowing your unlock passcode (either through shoulder surfing or forcing you to divulge it).  apple needs to find a very difficult balance between: 
1.	your data being kept safe from other people 
2.	you being able to get your data back even if you stuff up by forgetting or losing something 
3.	respecting privacy and trust expectations, particularly with end to end encrypted data 
4.	doing the above for the majority of the population that is technically incompetant, forgetful, often doesn‚Äôt read or follow basic instructions, and doesn‚Äôt plan ahead... 
  
even with apple‚Äôs current implementation we see many more people losing access due to forgotten passwords or broken/lost devices or out of date recovery info etc, vs the kind of theft being addressed here.  forcing users to know the current password before changing it can‚Äôt be implemented without also removing the other password reset methods that trust the same device (eg. pushed 6 digit 2fa codes).  the net impact would be to significantly increase the number of people losing their data or at least being very unhappy at the delays of account recovery. 
  
while the obvious best move is for users to use longer alphanumeric passcodes and/or be careful who is looking when entering the passcode, most people won‚Äôt do this and the real world is messy (see #4 above).  i know, i know, personal responsibility and all that but it is what it is. 
  
some proactive steps apple could take, however are:
1.	more user education & warnings (eg. a ‚Äúsecurity checkup‚Äù notification in settings every 12 months - remind user about the passcode‚Äôs critical importance, check&update trusted numbers, recommend using recovery contacts, re-enter the recovery key to see if you‚Äôve lost it etc) 
2.	when resetting the icloud password or changing 2fa settings - *if* a 28 digit recovery key is already set, require either the current icloud password or the recovery key to be supplied.  this enhances security for users who have decided to enable the recovery key, but some other people are going to lose their accounts by accident because they lost their recovery key and password... 
3.	[terrible idea] add an optional separate passcode for the keychain.  this will lead to some people losing their keychains the same way people lose password protected notes and complain about it despite the warnings they‚Äôre given.  the extra passcode can also be extracted from you at gunpoint.  i hate this idea a lot - imo its better to let people choose to add a separate password manager if they want, and remember this information can still be extracted from you by force - there is no way to avoid this. 
4.	[terrible idea] add a ‚Äúthis device is trusted‚Äù setting. disabling this blocks the device from changing icloud security settings and receiving pushed 6 digit 2fa codes, or icloud sms 2fa codes being sent to it.  it can only be re-enabled via a different device logged into the same account, or with the recovery key.  i hate this idea too, its a nightmare. 
  
and some reactive (post-theft) steps apple could take are:  

5.	 allow the account recovery process even if a recovery key is set, if the recovery key was created in the last 1-2 weeks  
6.	allow old (reset) recovery keys to be used for 1-2 weeks  
7.	allow password resets via deleted recovery contacts, if they were deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
8.	allow use of an old trusted phone number for password reset or account recovery, if it was deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
9.	for arbitration of 6/7/8, successful use of an old item invalidates newer items of the same type"

"live photos are amazing. my girlfriend and i have been going through a rough patch recently and i was looking back at old photos of us. i noticed that they were taken with live on and so i played them and in one she was laughing at the start of it and it made me break down crying, but not really in a bad way. i remember shortly after we took those photos she had told me she didn't like the live feature and i remember myself responding with something along the lines of ""i like to keep it on cause it might capture something special that i'd like to look back on later you know?""

it was honestly a nice reminder to never take anything or anyone for granted, and to cherish both the little and big things in life because they could easily disappear in the blink of an eye.

just wanted to share that lol. good luck to y'all and i hope you've created some memories through the feature as well :)"
"apple needs an option to ""trust"" certain airtags whenever i hang out with my friends one of us end up with a notification that an airtag is moving with us.

find my will only let us dismiss it for 24 hours and won't let you nickname them.

this is a big issue because we just ignore airtags alert now, assuming it's about a friend's airtag. so if someone were to actually track us with one, we would think anything of it.

apple needs to give an option to trust/ not notify for certain airtags and let you nickname them so you can tell if the airtag is a friend's or actually being used to stalk you"

"i'm a doctor and just released my first app ‚Äì a responsive mindful breathing app for stress & anxiety website: https://www.lungy.app
app store: https://apps.apple.com/app/lungy-breathing-exercises/id1545223887

hey guys!

lungy is an ios app that responds to breathing in real time, transforming your breath into a playful, interactive experience. i started working on it in 2020 during the first uk lockdown as a way to make breathing exercises much more fun and engaging. it's initially a wellness app, but hopefully at some point it can be developed into a platform for people with breathing problems (asthma, copd and long covid). i think it really makes the most of iphone hardware (it should run on iphone 6s+), with real-time cloth, fluid and rigid body sims all running on the gpu. you can also even create your own music using a synth and sequencer (go to settings/create music).

there are obviously lots of breathing and meditation apps out there, i wanted lungy to be different - it's about tuning into your surroundings and noticing the world around you, so all the visuals are nature-inspired or have some reference to the physical world. i didn‚Äôt like other apps required large downloads and/or a wifi connection, so lungy‚Äôs download size is very small (<50mb), with no geometry, video or audio files.


would love to hear feedback - thank you!"
"what made you switch to apple? i was seeing an apple add in reddit and i was thinking. why apple spends money in ads? don‚Äôt they have a strong fan base? when i jumped to apple was mostly to have a reliable ecosystem. previously had a huawei ecosystem (laptop, cellphone, tablet and headphones). but the cellphone would get issues with bank apps too often, my smart watch would glitch, and really small details that just slightly annoyed me. 

so in your case what made you jump to apple ?"
"ecosystem question from an oblivious ex-user hi,
i see so many youtubers that just keep on saying the same thing over and over, that ""apple devices just communicate well with each other"". i used to have some apple devices back then, but i definitely did not see any ecosystem magic happening. my parents have the latest iphones, apple watches, apple tvs but they apparently don't see anything either. but that may be because they aren't searching for it.
these days i myself am a pixel user. the pixel also has an ecosystem and i would like to find out how the apple one is to compare, since i heard it's better.

so i decided to go here to ask for some nice examples of apple devices working well together.


-----------
update:
thanks for educating me. just to summarize what i learned, i decided to create a sort of ""venn diagram"" in text.

apple only: using ipad as second screen, handoff (clipboard, files), stats from watch on appletv screen, using phone as webcam (although this is coming in android 14), airdrop with pc, signing phone documents on pc

both: headphone audio-switching, controlling tv, find my, synced texts between pc, phone and watch, ""airdrop"" (in quotes because it's called nearby share on android), cloud sync, password manager integrated into os, photos app syncing between devices, unlocking device with another device, airplay (chromecast on android), home devices automation (turning off tv when you're not home for example) - this last one requires set-up, continuing websites from computer on phone or vice versa, scanning documents to pc, transferring calls to other devices easily, starting maps on watch when phone navigation starts and vice versa

google only: headphone audio-switching on windows, synced texts on windows, touching 2 devices to wirelessly transfer files, being able to open android apps on windows and them syncing with your phone apps, usb tethering (extremely underrated, low-key amazing)

i think i put everything you guys mentioned in here. thanks for clarifying, from what it seems, the gap isn't really big.

i am searching for an alternative closed-in look and functionality to the guake terminal in macos.

functionality:

1. multiple tabs
2. ability to customize switching to a specific tab with a keyboard shortcut (like in guake)
3. top-down terminal
4. keyboard shortcuts like f12 to open and close it

thank you for providing the previous version of the icloud terms and conditions. i have compared it to the current version and here are the key changes that i have identified:

* section 1 (terms and conditions) has been updated to clarify that the agreement governs your use of icloud and any related apple services, products, and software.
* the previous version of section 2 (your account) included a subsection on the use of touch id and face id to access icloud. this subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your apple id.
* section 3 (use of icloud) has been updated to include a subsection on icloud backup, which allows you to backup and restore data from your ios or ipados devices.
* the previous version of section 4 (icloud services) included a subsection on icloud keychain. this subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead includes a subsection on ""icloud private relay,"" a new feature designed to enhance the privacy and security of your internet activity.
* section 6 (user content) has been updated to include a subsection on live photos, which allows you to share animated photos with others through icloud.
* section 10 (apple's intellectual property) has been updated to clarify that apple may use feedback you provide about icloud to improve the service.
* the previous version of section 11 (indemnification) included a subsection on the use of touch id and face id to access icloud. this subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your apple id.
* section 12 (dispute resolution) has been updated to include a subsection on class action waivers, which prohibit you from bringing claims against apple as part of a class action or consolidated action.

these are the key changes that i have identified between the previous version and the current version of the icloud terms and conditions. please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other changes that i did not identify or that are less significant.**

later edit:  **as embarassing as this is, i'm going to leave this up instead of deleting it. but i've learned a valuable lesson in ai being ""confidently incorrect"" or better more accurately, bullshit it pulled out of its ass.    i would have expected this to be a start to understand the terms better but in manually comparing them, there's not even the words ""biometric"" anywhere in the new terms nor ""face id"" and ""touch id"" in the old terms, to pick a simple but glaring example.**"
"my hate-love relationship with the homepod as a music enthusiast i hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to the homepod since the initial release because it was limited to be an apple music streaming box. i started looking into it when i heard about the new release. but more importantly, the possibility of using a pair as a stereo airplay device in macos.

it had been a while since i was looking for the perfect transportable audio setup, as i am always on the go. i like neutral sound; at home, i have kef ls50 speakers with a nuprime amp and the go campfire ara iems with a dragonfly dac/amp. finding a good comprise that would allow good sound and the possibility of being transported in a suitcase by plane was challenging. i had been thinking of going with an apollo twin and small bookshelves from either presonus or neumann. but it was still a lot of weight, and the setup would not go very low.

i went to the apple store for a listening session, but unfortunately, laying homepods on a table 50 cm below the ears with ambient noise does not do the trick. i ended up coming back home with two.

after setting them up as pair and selecting the output in macos, i opened the audio midi setup to check the bitrate and depth. i was pretty sure i heard airplay2 was bringing lossless, but there are some nuances ([apple airplay 2 supports 24-bit lossless audio, but you can‚Äôt use it | digitaltrends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/apple-homepod-24-bit-lossless-audio-airplay-2/)), and we are stuck at 16bit 44.1khz. figure out the logic behind being in the ecosystem (streaming from a macbook or an iphone) but still being software lock to the lowest quality. cherry on the cake is bye-bye streaming the alac library, their own lossless codec.

sound-wise, i admit it‚Äôs impressive! they sound way bigger than they are,  the soundstage is excellent. the high feels pretty bright, and the mids are clear. but when it comes to the base, although they are well-defined, they are way too pushed. i check the setting in the home app to discover that there is an option to reduce bass. it sounds way better; it leaves room for the rest, but it feels like a straight cut below 70hz. so we are stuck between choosing overkilled lows or no bass; it feels incomprehensible, given the potential of the hardware.

even with these unpleasant surprises, i will keep the pair of homepod because it corresponds best to my use case. it‚Äôs an unbeatable form factor for the sound, the dsp is great, and the setup is frictionless. it would not take that much to make the homepod appealing to a broader audience with a software update that:

* allow lossless streaming via airplay from any apple device
* add an eq setting for the homepod in home app"

like, if someone‚Äôs trying to steal a car that costs tens of thousands of dollars or something, a pair of airpods pro‚Äôs seems like a small investment, which they‚Äôd also get back if the car was stolen, or, if someone is obsessed enough with a person, they could just use airpods to track them. yes, it‚Äôs not nearly as discrete as an airtag, but it‚Äôs still not that difficult to hide if you try, especially in a car. the battery won‚Äôt last that long, but i‚Äôd still be creepy.

to be fair, i deactivated 5g since it makes no sense where i live. 

i am currently on 50% left with ~4hrs sot, which is roughly an estimated sot of 8hrs. that's good i guess? 
i didn't have to recharge through the day yet. i go to bed with 30-50% left after a total 15-17h of activity and ~5hrs sot.

"announcing notifications has anyone had any success getting their ipad or apple watch to announce notifications out loud?

i‚Äôve been experimenting with this announce notifications. on my iphone 14, i successfully got it to start announcing notifications from some of my most important applications. i went through the process of toggling on announce notifications, selecting those apps that i want it to announce notifications from, and then toggling on announce notifications on speaker.

i followed the same process on my ipad mini 5. yet despite me toggling on the same buttons, etc. that i did on my iphone, my ipad mini doesn‚Äôt announce the notifications. again, this is weird because i did the same thing on my ipad mini, that i did on my iphone, which now successfully announces the notifications i want it to.

also, i toggled on the announce notifications button on my apple watch, and selected the apps i wanted it to do so for. but yet, my apple watch is not announcing the notifications.

am i missing something here? some steps? any insight into why my iphone successfully announces notifications but my ipad and apple watch won‚Äôt?

"one of the rare times where a product leaves you amazed i have owned the airpods pro for a while and upgraded to the 2nd gen when they were released. i haven't had any issues losing any gadgets in a long while (knock on wood!), so in early january when i was traveling for work and staying in a friend's apartment while he was away it was disappointing when i couldn't find my airpods. ""find my"" had listed them at my location a mere 45 minutes earlier, but they were nowhere to be seen. i figured my streak had come to an end and i went out a few days later to replace them (they never popped back up on the map and i had them okay a sound and never heard anything).

skip ahead to 6-7 weeks later and i had just arrived back at my friend's apartment for another work trip. i always pay for a professional cleaning after i stay there and i walked in to find two earbuds sitting on the counter near the washing machine... ! i felt a pit in my stomach and searched the washing machine for the case and eventually found it in the dryer, sticking to the ceiling. *the airpods had been washed and dried. * 

i reached in and, trying to look on the bright side (they weren't lost, after all), collected the case. i opened it up to take a look and was shocked to see the light go on... and then my phone vibrated and let me know that my airpods had been located! could it be, could they be functional? i put the earbuds into the case and plugged it in to charge. 

thirty minutes later came the moment of truth--i unplugged them and put them into my ears. the familiar tone sounded and my phone connected to them! and then, i went to apple music and ... they sounded perfectly normal! after having been lost for over a month, during which time they were fully laundered, it was as if nothing ever happened!

maybe i shouldn't be impressed... but i am. to go through that sort of ordeal and still work perfectly well could easily be luck (and it probably is!), but it still shows a level of quality and reliability that i don't readily associate with other brands or products.

anyway, i don't know why anyone should care about this trivial story, but i thought i'd share so my positive experience is noted and in case it helps anyone to hear it."

"voice to text recently became so bad it is unusable for business. my experience is that about five years ago apple's voice to text was pretty good save for some minor fixes it needed.

nothing has changed with my voice, though i did buy an upgraded iphone.  but what has coincided with updates over the last two years is that its voice to text got a lot worse - then, very recently, it became garbage tier.

it's little wonder why i see so many drivers texting now - we can't rely on the phone to not make the other party pissed off.  but it isn't merely while commuting - it's also in the calm work environment.

and what's with it constantly trying to leave a space between the period at the end of sentences?  what's with commas placed in nonsensical places?  i'd much rather it skip trying to punctuate my voice than punctuating it badly."

the battery life on the apple watch is just too short for my lifestyle, i need a wearable that lasts multiple days per charge. this is important for me so i would even accept a fitness band and sacrifice smartwatch features.

"iphone 8/plus is peak design hear me out. 

even though i'm usually an android user, i always tried out some apple products, including iphones (i'm a tech fan, i do not stick to only one company) 

but the early iphones always kissed my eyes tbh. 

i'm currently rocking an iphone se (22) next to a p6p, and i may stick to the iphone for a longer period. 

i love the design with homebutton. it feels and looks so timeless and elegant. 

my biggest wish would be that apple keeps doing the se lineup in this design or even add one in the plus-size like the 8 plus. maybe put an oled in it, but i'm fine with the ips retina as well. 

i love that you can hold this phone without being on the screen instantly, i don't know what it is, but i prefer this sleek look with a square display over the modern, almost bezel-less designs. 

i can't be alone with this"

i'm convinced that i shoould switch back to mac, but my question is: how stable is this software/feature? does it crash? does it cause the computer to lack or use up too much ram?

thanks in advance, and sorry if i'm posting this in the wrong section."

"apple's standard warranty surprise i purchased a 5th gen 12.9 ipad pro in november. apple's standard warranty expires in august '23 for this unit. it was sold to me as excellent condition, which it was when i received it. it was much brighter than the 4th gen 12.9 ipad pro that i also have. i purchased a 6th gen 12.9 ipad pro recently. all purchased used, 'open box' on ebay. 

as i was synchronizing the settings of the 6th gen side-by-side with the 4th and 5th gen units, i noticed that the 5th gen was much brighter than the other two. now i realized that on the 5th gen *true tone,* a feature of these ipads, wasn't activated yet. but it was! that's when i realized it wasn't functioning! i called apple and the result was that it needed a repair that was covered under the standard 12 month hardware warranty. so i sent it in to apple.

i was just informed by apple that the repair could not be made because there was another problem with the device. the usb plug receptacle was damaged and that it needed to be replaced. that type of damage is not covered under the standard warranty. my choices were to not have the repairs done, or to let apple keep and recycle the unit or, cough, pay $799 for the repair.ü§Æ

i used that unit daily since november. i experienced no problem with the usb plug receptacle. yet here i am. this is not a complaint. my days of complaining are over. i will accept the unit back of course. i'm curious to see what, if any, difference there is with the usb plug receptacle when i receive it back! if it is returned as i sent it in, i can do without *true tone.* when the 7th gen ipad 12.9 is released, i'll get that one too.

i always get applecare+ but the unit needs to be within the time frame that one would qualify to purchase applecare+. this unit was beyond that time period.

warranties of any kind, from any company, are not black or white. they are gray. in this matter, for me, it is insignificant. but for a hard-working young person who struggles to get along in life, i believe this would be a big disappointment. my purpose for this post is to make readers aware, to expect the unexpected; to always be prepared."

i haven‚Äôt seen any articles or youtubers talking about this, perhaps i am part of a particular bubble that just doesn‚Äôt seem to find this useful. i know that apple stock camera, the measure app and some accessibility functions make use of it. however more interested whether some applications that really depends on it, it‚Äôs a bit strange that such feature is made so mainstream but i don‚Äôt see any pone talking about it.

thanks.




update so far:
beside what i mentioned the apple stock app above (camera, measure and accessibility), apparently used for

-	 extensive and maybe daily use by people that need to measure 3d objects
-	dimensions of an interior (floor plans, house or even caves). mainly personal use, but also business use
-	medical profession to scan body part
-	drone scanning of grounds

note: some shared some interesting info about lidar use in general, i was particularly interested for the iphone/ipad, since i am planning to get one."
"ios 16.3 can delete data on your iphone/ipad without asking - i've lost 2500+ books hello,

in feb ios 16.3 has deleted all my 2500+ books from apple books on ipad. epubs and articles in pdfs, which were sorted in many categories.

probably, it has happened because my ipad's storage was full and ios had decided to delete books instead of caches, offloading apps or deleting icloud photos (which can be re-downloaded from the cloud).

without informing the user, of course. icloud wasn't enabled for apple books. no jb.

here is the story:

i was browsing in the evening, when my ipad has turned off - the battery was empty. i've connected the charger and left it till the morning. in the morning ipad was up and running, i was using it as usual. few hours later i've opened apple books and it was empty: no books, no covers, just empty collections. checked ipad storage tab - 50gb free space (this space was occupied by books) and apple books with 0mb for documents.

ok, going to logs - nothing unusual. silence. ok, i have a full itunes backup, not the freshest one - 6 months old, but better than no backup at all.

i was able to get into my ipad to make as low-level examination as possible.

what i've checked:

    /var/mobile/media/books/purchases - empty, all books were deleted
    bklibrary - empty, only categories
    /var/mobile/media/books/purchases/purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/media/books/purchases/backup-purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/media/books/sync/books.plist - some titles and filenames, but not all

i've identified when books were deleted - at 03:52:

    bklibrary (recovered records):
    table zbkcollectionmember
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;

then i've spent almost 1,5 weeks digging in ios internals and i was able to identify the key suspect - some sort of ""experiments"", which ios executes on user devices:

bingo! time is the same as in bklibrary when records (and books!) were deleted.

so, ios has silently deleted all books.

later i have written a custom parser, which examined 2 600 000+ rows of raw data of some internal indexes, which ios uses and it helped me to recover some info: titles and file names.

still a long way to combine all findings for recovery.

findings:

* ios 16.3 can delete all books without asking
* itunes full backup is not backing up sideloaded pdfs & epubs in apple books
* when apple books app is backed up via itunes, bklibrary database is vacuumed, so no deleted data inside.
* no info is logged about deletion - but i'm checking for extra evidences
* logs are clean: no suspicious activity
* there are no single place with metadata for apple books - i'm assembling info piece by piece from many places in ios: databases, logs, activity data, thumbnails etc. 90% manual work.

i'll make a new post later, including all details related to my apple books forensics and recovery.

&#x200b;

p.s. keep in mind that ios can delete any data anytime - do manual backups. icloud can fail as well - imagine losing years of private photos..."

"apple's $3000 laptop: a heater or a macbook pro i9?  hello everyone,

if you're a macbook pro user, you may be familiar with the issues that have plagued the 2018 i9 models. despite the significant price tag, these laptops suffer from severe overheating and throttling issues that can make the computer nearly unusable.

many users have reported that their macbook pro i9s will overheat and then slow down or shut down to prevent damage to the system. this problem can occur even when the laptop is not under heavy load, making it difficult to use for even basic tasks.

what's even more frustrating is that apple has remained largely silent on the issue. despite numerous complaints and even a petition signed by over 11,000 people, the company has not taken any significant action to address the problem or compensate affected customers.

it's not right that users have to spend so much money on a product that fails to live up to its promises. it's even worse that apple hasn't faced any consequences for this issue, leaving users feeling frustrated and unheard.

so i'm asking you, fellow macbook pro i9 users, do you think it's right that apple hasn't faced any consequences for these issues? what steps should the company take to address the problem and make things right for affected customers?

let's raise our voices and demand action from apple on this issue. our hard-earned money deserves a laptop that works properly. thank you for your time and attention."
"just released a major update to dime, a beautiful and intuitive personal finance tracker and budgeting tool. now with income tracking, overall budgets, ui redesigns and more! hey r/apple! hope you‚Äôre having a great weekend.

tldr: [dime 2.0](https://apple.co/3ancqcn) is here with income tracking, overall budgets, a ui makeover and more! it is a beautiful, intuitive expense tracker built with ios design guidelines in mind. and, it's 100% free with no ads or paywalls.

nearly half a year ago, i launched dime 1.0 as a project to kickstart my programming journey, and was taken aback by the response. i am immensely grateful for all the comments, reviews, and feedback i have gotten ever since, majority of them being from this subreddit!

the most requested feature by far had got to be income tracking. i was initially rather reluctant to add this in as it would essentially require a complete overhaul and migration of existing data models and the ui built around them. additionally, i felt it would diminish the simplicity of the app that many users had grown to love. nonetheless, with the help of the 300 beta testers on testflight, i was able to experiment with different integrations of this new feature, and eventually landed on one i was really satisfied with.

today, i‚Äôm proud to present dime 2.0, its biggest update thus far. and of course, no changes to the pricing model - still a 100% free with no ads, paywalls, or data collection.

üí• what's new in v2.0!

-	the feature requested in almost every support email - income tracking.
-	redesigned input interface that minimises excessive swiping if you have many categories.
-	redesigned category list with category suggestions and the ability to reorder categories.
-	rebuilt the insights page to minimise lag and crashes.
-	lock screen widgets for ios 16.
-	overall category-less budgets!.
-	added interactive line graph to the home page (turned off by default, can be accessed via feature lab in settings).
-	insight filtering configuration now persists between sessions i.e. if you configure your insights page to show monthly statistics, it will stay that way from then on (and not revert to the default, which is weekly insights).
-	added triangular indicators to the budget bar graphs which show the optimal spending percentage.
-	option to have a more compact budgets page by swapping the grid for rows.
-	custom time frames (e.g. 3 days, 5 weeks, 7 months) for recurring transactions.
-	swipe to delete transactions.

ü•∞ why you‚Äôll love dime

-	100% free forever, with no paywall or ads.
-	beautifully ios-centric design, with simplicity at its core.
-	insightful expenditure breakdowns over various time periods.
-	create budgets based on expense categories and stick to them.
-	create recurring expenses with custom time frames.
-	sync your expenses, categories and budgets with other devices via icloud.
-	custom reminders to input your expenses.
-	biometric authentication to protect your data.
-	home screen quick actions make capturing new expenses a breeze.
-	a gorgeous night theme for dark mode fanatics.
-	informative home and lock screen widgets keep you updated at a glance.

i genuinely hope dime will be able to help you cultivate prudent expenditure habits. any feedback or thoughts is welcomed, and appreciated. moreover, if you have found dime to be useful, it would be incredibly helpful if you could give it a great review on the app store. am unable to afford marketing for a free app, so ratings and reviews are my best bet at spreading the word about it.

a special thanks to all those who have generously tipped the app, all proceeds will go towards my upcoming apple developer subscription cycle payment üòä

have a great week ahead!

"apple watch 7 compatibly i had to downgrade my phone from 11 to a 6s. on the apple forums it said this phone was compatible with a watch 7. but when i went to pair it with the 6s it said i didn‚Äôt have the right version of ios on the phone. it‚Äôs been updated to the latest version it can.

was going to try and pick up an iphone x on the cheap but now i‚Äôm concerned it won‚Äôt work.

does anyone know first hand if the x will work. the info on the internet doesn‚Äôt seem to be reliable. 

thanks"
"beware ordering same day delivery i ordered a new macbook pro for my company. it was to be delivered to my house by postmates/uber within a few hours. i received a text saying get ready for your delivery. then a text saying your delivery is arriving. a guy came to my door w/ an apple bag, showing my name and address and order #, and my new computer was taped into the bag. he asked me if my name was ? i said yes. he had me sign for the delivery. i took the bag and shut my door. i received a text saying my order was delivered. a few minutes later, he rang my door again. i don‚Äôt know why i answered. but i answered, and he said he had delivered to the wrong address and he must take my computer back from me, please hand it over. wtf? i said no, this is my computer, i paid for it, i signed for it, i have all the payment and delivery receipts. he kept insisting and implying that i was a thief. i got my husband involved. my husband tried showing the guy the bag proving this is the correct address and he needs to leave. the guy kept threatening saying he‚Äôs going to ask one more time then he will call the cops. i told him to call the cops then, and shut the door. 

he called the cops, i called the cops, they came, were super bored w/ the whole thing, it was clear the delivery guy was in the wrong, they showed him the actual bag he gave me that the computer was in, that listed my name and address and order#, proving he was at the right address. the cops said the guy then apologized to them and drove away. 

but i was left shaking and nerves a mess. so i called apple to let them know what happened w/ their delivery. the lady on the phone was horrified and apologetic, said that should never have happened, told me i did everything right disengaging and contacting police, that the guy handled it wrong. she said he is not law enforcement so if he thought he made a mistake he had no authority to go demand my computer back from me, he should have contacted apple and they would have easily and quickly confirmed that he delivered to the correct address. 

so going forward i am going to just pick up my orders myself rather than trust uber drivers, and highly recommend for others whenever you can."
"[promo codes] jester is a new ios app that writes photo captions for you [app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1661372840)

hi all, i thought it would be cool to use ai for something fun, so i made an [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jester-ai-caption-writer/id1661372840) that writes **instagram captions for you using just an image**‚Äîincluding puns, jokes, and hashtags. it usually gets the captions right and i‚Äôve been pretty astonished by how funny some of them can be.

how it works is you pick any photo (no sign-in required) jester generates four unique captions. from there, you can choose your favorite and edit it as you wish. if you're not happy with any of the captions, click the retry button to generate four more. you can also add context, use the photo location, or generate more variants of any caption. when you're happy, you can copy the caption, share it, or post to instagram.

captioning 5 photos is free every day and there's a paid subscription for unlimited captions (because running ai models is expensive), but i will share a promo code for a **free year with the first 5 people who comment** with a caption written by jester! if you're not one of the first 5, don't worry because you can have 1 free month using the code [sunday](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=sunday) which can be redeemed at [https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=sunday](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=sunday) (on iphone or ipad)

p.s. i understand the importance of privacy for people's photos, so jester does not keep or store any images at all."

"iphone silent switch should be able to switch to a focus instead of just silence. would love if i could set the silent switch to change to the ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù focus for example. switching between different focuses would be really great.
this would allow for some people to still call through while everything else is silenced.

sadly the only options that silence has is whether haptics are left on.

"apple store repair and service is really dissapointing this is a bit of a rant, 

i spent a large part of today driving to and from the apple store to get my companies older 2015 15‚Äù mbp looked at. random shutdowns on battery have been happening for a number of years but it hasn‚Äôt been a priority since it has been plugged in most of the time. we‚Äôve recently brought someone new on and wanted to give them this mac to use - but they need something reliable while being away from power. 

i was pretty sure the battery was the issue, but i did not want to get it replaced only for it to be something more serious like the logic board. we‚Äôre a small company and need to be smart about our expenses. the battery cycles are 280-300 for a 7 year old computer. i spent 30 minutes on apple chat last week and they recommended going in-store to get it looked at where they can do more in depth diagnostics. it‚Äôs a 40 min drive each way, but if it helps illuminate the issue then its worth it. 

first off, everyone at the conestoga (canada) apple store was very nice. my complaints are not about their direct service but the corporate policies they have to follow. 

they ran a diagnostic on the laptop and it came back with 80% battery health. they ran the diagnostic plugged in. i had it unplugged a couple of times at the apple store and it would shutdown as it usually does when the battery is sub 60%. in the rare cases where it does not shut down the battery drops really fast. 

i am more than willing to pay for the battery to be replaced. but, in order to replace the battery on the 2015 models they need to replace the top case (keyboard, trackpad). **because the battery health is at 80% (and not 79% or lower) - they can‚Äôt replace the battery without charging me for a top case replacement! **the battery fee as quoted on their website is $250 (all prices in canadian dollars), but with the mandatory top case replacement it jumps to around $700. not worth it for a 7-8 year old computer. 

what frustrates me is, the apple tech in-store had no agency in the matter. it was clear as day the battery was failing and leading to restarts. yet his own system would not let him order the battery replacement without the top case charge being applied because it was 1% over the required number for it to be eligible. his best solution was to use the laptop on battery as much as possible until it hits 79% and then to come back to get it fixed. driving 40 mins each way again in the hope that they will replace the battery seems like a bit of a fools errand.

over the last couple of years i have had other repair needs (apple watch battery, airpods connection issues) and the experience always ends up being the same. the people at the store can see the issue, but have no agency to get it fixed. 

this laptop in particular, was purchased at the apple store for $2500+ cad, plus apple care +. we never used apple care before it expired and now we‚Äôre being denied a battery replacement (without paying the extra fee) because the health is 1% off replacement level according to their diagnostics. yet the real world performance is clearly failing at a basic level. 

i am a little late to the game in getting apple devices, but my impression was that apple had the best service and while they charge a lot for their tech - the support is top notch. that simply has not been my experience in any interaction i have had with them in the last 3-5 years. i don‚Äôt know if this is a canada issue, or all apple stores. but i am just do disappointed in the entire process. i don‚Äôt have a lot of free time and to waste it on something like this is really frustrating."
"icloud backup overrides whatsapp in app backup so what‚Äôs the point in of people backing up both? by making a icloud backup your saving everything on the iphone - a copy 

if you were to make a whatsapp in app backup a couple of days after your latest icloud backup, then have to reset or transfer your device and install from that said icloud backup it would load the icloud whatsapp backup that‚Äôs 3 days old ? not the newest in app backup that was made in whatsapp that was made 3 days later ? because it‚Äôs saved on the drive itself ? 

so essentially ios will always load the icloud backup before the whatsapp in app backup ?

edit - so turns out if you disable the icloud backup from the old backup delete the app then reinstall it it lets you load from the new manual backup"
"clean installation of ventura appears to automatically enable filevault -- no recovery key supplied? when setting up a new machine or updating to a major release, one of the first things i do is enable filevault. in the past, it has always thrown up a modal dialog giving me the option to copy the recovery key, which i always do.

i upgraded two machine this week. using a usb installer, i wiped the ssd clean and started from scratch. upon first login to ventura, i went to enable filevault. it was already enabled, and at no point was i ever given the recovery key. apple support has no answer other than ""turn it off, then turn it on and get a new recovery key"".

great that they are trying to strengthen data protection on macos; bad that they have left people in the dark on how to recover if something going wrong. disabling/re-enabling is bullshit.

anyone else seen this?"

"i got ask to set up a recovery key but i already have one (advanced data protection) - anyone else having issues with adp and recovery keys? i've enabled advanced data protection about two weeks ago and set up a recovery key before hand. the recovery key setup was always extremely buggy. after creating one, most of the time it would still say that i haven't set up a key yet. sometimes it works for a day, and then it shows ""off"" again for the recovery key in the settings. after some time i was finally able to also enable advanced data protection (always got the error ""unknown error occurred while enabling advanced data protection"").

now about two weeks later, with advanced data protection and recovery key both enabled, i suddenly got a notification on my mac saying ""account recovery method needed"": [https://ibb.co/8rpnckq](https://ibb.co/8rpnckq)

i clicked on it and it created a new recovery key instantly, without asking me again.

what is going on with this whole advanced data protection and recover key mess? anyone else having issues with that?

honestly i'm at a point now that i don't even trust the recovery key to actually work when i need it. since something must have triggered the message in the screenshot above, even though i already had a key set up. and all the issues before with having set up a key but not being able to activate advanced data protection or showing the status of the recovery key as ""off"", even though i had it enabled."

"genius bar is a horrible experience and a complete waste of time. unfortunately i've had a lot of issues with my apple products this year and have had the unpleasant experience of dealing with apple support.

in early january, my m1 ipad pro 12.9"" stopped charging about 16 months after purchasing. now i am an electronics hobbyist and i know a thing or two about troubleshooting and i did all i could without opening the ipad. when i contacted apple support they told me i needed to make a genius bar appointment and the only ones available in a reasonable timeframe were during the work day. so i took a couple hours off to drive out the the apple store only to have to wait an extra 30m after my appointment time for the ""genius"" to check the usb port for dust and verify it wasn't charging (something i already did before) before telling me i was screwed and a replacement would be $800. i ended up taking it to a third party repair shop and they replaced the usb c port for $200.

recently i noticed my airpod pro 2 case battery was draining about 20-25% per day without even using the earbuds. apparently this is a common problem that multiple people report having. i called apple and they guided me through resetting the device and told me to call them again if the problem persisted, so i did. when i called them again after testing, they told me i could schedule a genius bar appointment and get a replacement. so i repeat the process and drive out for the appointment and the ""genius"" takes my airpods to the back to run some tests. when he comes back out after 20m he tells me he could not find anything wrong with them and that my options were to live with the problem or send it in to an apple repair center. i opted to send them in. we'll see if apple lives up to their warranty or not...

either way, each of these appointments took about 1h30m of my time only to have apple's genius representative to tell me to pound sand. in both of my experiences, the in-person representatives i met were unhelpful, uncompassionate, and slightly rude. apple products cost way too much to have this poor of a support experience

&#x200b;

edit: i forgot to mention. apple will not ship my airpods back to me from their service center. i have to spend another 60-90 minutes in order to go to the apple store to pick them up again"
"what is the best application for customize keyboard shortcuts for macos? hi apple community :),

i am new user to macos system, i came from linux (ubuntu 20) and windows 11, and i saw macos keyboard shortcuts are different and also not all the keyboard shortcuts that available in linux or windows can be done with macos, and hence i ask you what is the best third application for customize keyboard shortcut for macos for my following needs:

1. launching application from the dock by keyboard shortcut 'windows key + number' (like in windows 11)
2. selecting text and paste it with mouse wheel click (like in linux)

i believe in the future i will use much more keyboard shortcuts, i really love productive tools.  
i will be happy to hear from you on recommendation apps.

"iphone upgrade v. trading in this question has been asked many times, but i haven‚Äôt seen anyone mention the trade in specials that seem to happen every time a new iphone comes out. with the iphone 14, i think (may be mistaken) every major carrier offered it free if trading in an iphone 13 pro. presumably something similar can be expected for the 15. so doesn‚Äôt it make the most sense to just always buy the newest iphone and trade it in for potentially 100% off the next one, rather than enroll in the iup? a bit of risk but it seems minimal, and you‚Äôre probably going to get a good trade-in or sale value even if not 100%. i must be missing something here - anyone have any input?"

"what happens if i downgrade my icloud storage, and what is the difference between not paying/not downgrading and downgrading? first of all, here are some key points of information that you'll have to remember in my case  
1. i'm currently using the 200gb icloud storage plan, but i plan to downgrade soon (within around a week) in order to not have it required to be paid monthly (due to financial reasons)  
2. my iphone only has 64 gigabytes of storage; it is a pre-paid phone (which cannot be returned) and i do not have any other devices that are able to fully download all of my icloud storage  
if i were to downgrade my icloud storage from 200gb back to the default 5gb, what will happen to the rest of the data that exceeds it? (keep in mind that my iphone only has 64 gigabytes, and none of my devices have enough storage to download all of my icloud storage) if my photos won't sync to my icloud storage (uploading), will it still load the full-resolution images (downloading) when i view an image on my iphone that has been shrunken down to the optimized size?  
i read an article that said:  
""if you stop paying for your icloud storage, you will receive a pop-up on your phone telling you to pay. if you refuse, you will have 30 days to get your data from the cloud before it's erased permanently. if in those 30 days you decide to keep paying, all your stuff will remain there.""  
i have questions about this:  
there are 2 routes that are in question:  
1. the route where you simply do not pay for icloud storage and do not downgrade (which has already been specified that one will have 30 days to download all of the data before it gets wiped)   
2. the route where you downgrade your icloud storage to the default 5gb (which it is unknown to me what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb) to not have to pay monthly anymore  
for the second route, i wish to know what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb once i downgrade my icloud storage; what will happen to my backups? will my photos still be read from icloud storage (for full resolution)?  
tl;dr: i have very valuable data on my icloud storage that, due to financial reasons, cannot be kept paid monthly, so i plan to downgrade my icloud storage, and i can't download all of my icloud storage to any of my devices because they don't have enough storage either, so i ask 3 questions:  
1. what will happen to the data that exceeds the default 5gb?  
2. what will happen to my data backups?  
3. will my photos still be read from icloud storage (meaning that will the optimized saved photos on my iphone still read the full resolution videos and images placed on icloud)?"

"has anyone else noticed a huge increase in the amount of spam they get in their icloud email addresses? i keep an apple/icloud email address because i've had it since the days of [mobile.me](https://mobile.me) and, in fact, have a tiny little user name on it. so i use it for the sole purpose of whenever anyone says ""what's your email address?"" i can say ""i'm [pdc@me.com](mailto:pdc@me.com)"" instead of ""i'm p o r k c h o p underscore d...""   


but, recently, i've noticed i'm getting a ton of the worst kind of spam from that email address - obvious phishing spam, obvious ""congratulations! get your free harl3y-davids0n motorcycle"" type spam.  


i keep waiting for apple to tighten up their filters but... no.

"optimized battery charging i'm considering taking the free iphone my company offers - which i previously always declined.

right now im looking into it again and am checking for the features and apps/ workflows that apparently don't ""just work"" with ios.

one example is the smart charging. there seems to be a feature for determining how one uses his phone and then charging it till 80% and only completing the charge once the used algorithm deems it the right time. right not i only charge my android for a few minute a day so that i reaches about 80% and have hard capped it there. due to the slow charging speed iphones i would charge it overnight and therefore need this feature to work properly.

from what i found online this system doesn't seem to work that well and on my girlfriends xr it deems 3am the perfect time to be fully charged... 

so why is there no setting to set a specific time for the phone to be fully charged or even better, have it depend on the set alarm time of the next day? is there a way to set these obviously needed settings and i just didn't find them?

are there other ways to fix this?"

"recommendations to improve apple health's medications feature # *tl;dr - let's create a singular master thread of requests, to send to apple, for apple health's medication functionality.*

i was so excited by the new medications offering in apple health. as a chronically ill person who has more than 12 medications to track (and often change) every day, i was relieved that apple would finally offer us something that i wasn't getting from 3rd party apps, as well as the bonus of smooth integration across my apple devices (really important for my physical disabilities). 

the initial offering is ok, but it has huge potential. i've no doubt apple already has a long list of features and changes they plan to make with the functionality but i know from a product development standpoint, it's really important that they hear from the consumers which requests are most vital. i'm not entirely sure if they have, or plan to, consult with people who have chronic or complex health issues, but i do feel it's important we let them know they could really help improve our lives with a few tweaks. 

this realisation led me to start submitting through their [health feedback form](https://www.apple.com/feedback/health/). unfortunately there is a character limit and i know that most people will not submit a form for every single suggestion. i personally gave up after the first 5. so i've come to the conclusion of creating a master thread that can be shared with them directly. that's what i'm hoping to achieve here. 

if you use the medications feature, or even just tried it but didn't continue, please have your say. if someone has already made a suggestion you agree with, upvote it! please also include your country, as functionality currently varies and will be helpful to give context to your feedback/suggestion.

thank you in advance üòä"

"whats the point of 2fa if you can just change your password on your iphone without it? (medellin gunpoint robbery) just read a terrible story in medellin reddit of a girl in a city park getting tossed down a hill and robbed.  they made her write down her apple password.  then of course they changed the password on her apple account.  apple is of no help recovering her account and of course the phone is gone, etc.

after being glad the girl is ok, i thought for sure that i was protected from something like this because i have 2fa.

nope!  when you head to settings, it says, ""because you are logged into icloud, you can change your password.""  no 2fa!  then it says ""you want to log out of all your other devices?""

every other little thing i log into, for instance the new york times that i signed up for using apple's anonymous email service, requires me to use 2fa.  

so why when changing the password am i not required to do any 2fa?  is it because if you lose your password they could just send it to your email which is on your phone anyway?  

is there a way to truly theft-proof your phone?   because when a gun is pointed at you, its a good idea to fork everything over including passwords."

"i am going watch only in my day to day life. if apple gave us ipad and/or mac integration i would throw my phone in the trash. feeling the fatigue of smartphone addiction i got a cellular apple watch series 8 and put it in the drawer for the last week.

edit: put the phone in the drawer last week. sorry for being vague. 

i love it. there is something liberating about being able to go out in public and not having the whole wide world of the internet in your pocket. if you are careful the watch battery will last all day and you get your calls, texts, as you would on your phone. apple really should lean into the watch being the phone for people who are sick of their phone. i use my ipad when i ""need"" apps. but otherwise i do not think that i will return to full time smartphone usage again.

edit: to save on battery i actually found that sony still makes dedicated mp3 players not connected to the internet to offload listening time. its like its 2005 again."

"for those who switched from android to iphone, what do you like about iphone more than android and what was something you missed on android? what i switched from: samsung galaxy s10

what i switched to: iphone 14 pro

what i like about my iphone 14 pro over my s10:

* better camera quality
* longer battery life
* imessage and facetime

what i miss about my s10:

* fingerprint scanner
* easier customization
* easier to download things
* more features such as split screen
* being a lighter phone (since my 14 pro is heavy)
* headphone jack"
"can't add android to group chat so i just attended a meet and greet type event and one person started a big group chat. i have an android phone and they were unable to add me to the group because everyone else had an iphone. it's likely i am going to be excluded from this group as a result, and the couple people who tried to add me just shrugged and said i should just get an iphone.

i don't understand why apple makes it so difficult and borderline impossible to integrate with the other major players in the phone industry. it's designed to be exclusive of non apple products. why do so many people stand by apple products despite the major compatibility issues with messaging?"
"apple and uber have left me empty-handed and out of pocket - $2,098.04 dollars worth of apple products stolen from an uber eats driver i recently had a terrible experience with apple and uber that i wanted to share with you. i ordered an iphone 14 pro max and an apple watch ultra gps watch through apple's website, which were supposed to be delivered to me by ubereats. i paid extra for the items to be picked up from a local apple store and hand-delivered to my address. the uber driver assigned to the delivery falsely marked it as delivered and never showed up, despite my clear instructions and follow-up text messages. i waited outside the entire time and the delivery wasn't ever made.

i contacted apple support, and although they initially agreed to replace one of the items, the watch they later decided to cancel the replacement order, and denied me the replacement for the phone. the result of this has left me with a $2,098.04 hole in my pocket and leaving me with no other recourse. to add insult to injury, unfortunately, the police department is unable to file a report for civil matters.

i am deeply disappointed by the lack of assistance and resolution from both uber and apple. i have evidence of the conversations with the driver and video footage of me waiting for the delivery outside my building. my question to the community is, has anyone else ever experienced anything like this with apple, and if so, do you have any recommendations on how to best address this matter?

i hope that my experience will serve as a cautionary tale and that both companies will take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. i realize that this is an unofficial community site for apple and while i have no expectations of this message being seen by them, i wanted to raise awareness to everyone making purchases directly from the apple store, especially via the use of third-party delivery services such as uber-eats and postmates.

**\*update 02/16/2023\***

today, i spent several hours speaking with various apple representatives from the escalations team. eventually, i was connected to a ""senior manager of the online store"" who informed me that the investigation into the matter has been closed and that apple will not be pursuing any further investigations. according to apple, a delivery was made, and they will not be compensating me for my losses. i requested evidence that the delivery was made to me personally, but the representative stated that information regarding the internal investigation could not be disclosed to me.

after my attempts to contact apple and resolve this amicably, i feel like i have hit a dead end, and unfortunately, the criminal who stole my $2,098.04 worth of apple products appears to be getting away with the theft. i am utterly speechless.

i made contact with a second police department in my area who was willing to make a police report and filed this under ""grand theft"". i now have this along with the other evidence i've collected.

**\*update 02/17/2023\***

i am pleased to inform you that a member of apple's leadership team contacted me and has agreed to issue a full refund for the total cost of the stolen items.  i am thankful for the opportunity provided by apple to resolve my issue. however, the refund process to my original payment method is still pending, which might take a few days considering the holiday on monday in the us. i remain optimistic that i will receive my money back by tuesday and will update this thread as soon as the entire amount has been refunded.

however, it is disheartening to know that the criminal responsible for this theft may get away with it. sadly, this is the unfortunate reality of living in california. nonetheless, i appreciate the effort and attention given to this matter by apple's leadership team.

to the apple subreddit community, i would like to express my gratitude for the valuable comments, feedback, and advice provided. your input has been immensely helpful, and i sincerely appreciate your time and effort. thank you all for your contributions.

**\*update 02/22/2023\***

as of this morning, my bank account has been credited with the total refund amount as per the commitment made by apple's leadership team.

i also wanted to highlight that despite the promise of two separate representatives asserting that the team responsible for handling loss/theft of items would be reaching out to me within 24-48 hours on the 16th (6 days ago), ubereats **never** made any attempt to contact me regarding this matter."
"icloud removing metadata from photos so i recently decided to download a bunch of old photos from my icloud account to my hard drive, going back years. you can only download 1000 photos max at a time, so this took awhile. anyway i finally get my photos going back years and to my surprise, all of the metadata for location and time has been stripped! 


instead of having the time the photo was taken in the metadata, it just shows when they were downloaded from icloud now. totally sucks. is there a fix for this? i‚Äôm assuming not."

i transferred my settings from my 10.5‚Äù ipad pro and 1st gen pencil, so i (and some other people in the apple forums) think the edit: this also only seems happen when going from the first gen pencil straight to an m2 ipad pro with the second gen pencil. old settings are messing something up. if anyone has figured out how to fix it (other than wiping and starting as a new ipad), please comment.

edit: this also only seems happen when going from the first gen pencil straight to an m2 ipad pro with the second gen pencil.

"after alternative stores come to ios‚Ä¶ - discussion hi just wanted to pick your heads. imo alt stores are going to cause a clusterfu*k environment, i fear that you will have to have 7 app stores installed just to get 7 apps. epic will be one, google, microsoft, meta and many more will i think push for their own stores. and if you have your app on one store there is no need to be on another. 

also i fear the amount of unveted apps that will flood the market and inevitable wreck all the good apple has done with their tracking policies.

new macbook air said to launch next quarter following rumor of 15-inch model 
iphone 15 pro again rumored to feature ultra-thin bezels like apple watch 
"inconsistencies with ""the ecosystem"". the integration between apple devices is really great. notes, reminders (more on that later), unlock your devices with the watch, airdrop etc. it would be really hard to switch back to pc/android as it doesn't really have any of that. however...

apple watch can unlock my iphone and macbooks but not my ipad. one of my laptops is 7-8 years and my ipad is the latest pro with m2.

the books app knows my position in ebooks across devices but for audio books (bought in the apple store) it doesn't sync. also, if i'm listening to an audio book on my iphone there is no indication of this in ""playing now"" on my apple watch.

if i leave my computer somewhere that isn't my home and then leave i will get a notification on my apple watch that i left it behind. if i leave it at home i don't get that notification. so far so good. but even if i go out for a walk with the dog i will always get a notification that my ipad is left behind.

if i listen to a song on apple music on my phone and pause it then tell siri on my watch to continue playing music it will play whatever i played on my watch before.

alarms set on my phone will sound on my watch. alarms set on my watch will not sound on my phone. this one i actually kind of like but it would be nice if there was an option to only have the alarm ring on certain devices depending on focus model. i probably shouldn't get started on siri since she really suck, but a small thing like ""set an alarm on my iphone"" get the response ""set the alarm for when?"" ""1 minute"" ... alarm is only set on your watch, not your phone. 

i never get any reminders on my ipad. iphone, apple watch and macbooks all do.

is this intended behaviour and i'm just not ""getting"" it? are there any workarounds for any of my niggles? i'm open to third-party apps, especially for audio books since i really dislike the apple audio book interface in general."

"iphones are not the same anymore i am a long-time iphone user. for the simple reason that it comes with software that simply works. but somehow that was apparently the case. in my opinion, this is no longer the case. since ios 16, i have noticed that the iphone has more and more bugs in everyday life. i can put on my beats headphones and my iphone can't wake up for like 5 minutes or so. widgets are not displayed correctly or partially not at all, once i couldn't even open apps anymore, only one key combination helped to force a shutdown. this is very annoying, as the devices are really very expensive.

i have similar problems with my ipad.

what are your experiences? are androids now more stable than iphones?"

"elephas - personal ai writing assistant for mac, iphone, and ipad (ver 5.3 released) hello [r/apple](/r/apple)

i am an independent developer from india.

i have built an app called [elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-promo-sunday-1202-01), a personal ai writing assistant that works seamlessly across all your mac apps, as well as an ai-enabled keyboard for your iphone and ipad.

just released a new version of the app last week.

update: elephas and chatgpt are not the same; they have slightly different use cases. elephas applies an ai layer on top of your mac while you continue to follow your workflow.

**version 5.3 updates:**

in the latest version, i have released features such as -

**snippets -** configure shortcuts to perform day-to-day tasks with the help of ai. it supports all popular languages. you can do tasks across your apps, including editors and spreadsheet tools.

**tones** - to personalize text output and write in your own unique style.

**preserve formatting** - so that the generated text maintains the format and styling of the original text.

and many more tiny improvements and utilities.

# a brief overview of the tool -

first off, very pleased to share that now 500+ professional users use the app every day :)

elephas helps business professionals use ai to save time on day-to-day tasks. emails, documents, blogs, jira stories, social media posts, etc.

our users praise it as a swiss army knife for their daily productivity.

**""an ai tool that they actually use in their daily workflow""**

it differs from other ai tools in that it works on top of your favorite apps, so there is no need to switch between windows or work in a browser window.

you can get the power of ai within your favorite mac apps like mail, pages, docs, and any other apps built for the mac.

with elephas,

*   you can rewrite your content, improve it or even generate new content on a topic.
    
*   you can use it to quickly reply to your emails, messages, and social media posts.
    
*   you can even use it for creating presentations and generating excel formulas.
    
*   and now you can even define your own tasks with the ""snippets"" feature.
    

based on our user requests, i introduced the ai assistant to ios devices (beta).

it follows the same philosophy, wherein you can use the writing assistant without leaving the app you are writing on.

so you can use an ai keyboard within whatsapp, mail, imessage, etc.

here's the demo of how the ai keyboard works -

[https://youtu.be/y5vrh3clgyo](https://youtu.be/y5vrh3clgyo)

there is a wide range of utility features built into the app to make your daily workflow smooth and fast with the power of ai.

**one last point**

the app is privacy friendly. you can use your own openai keys, and none of your data is stored on our servers.

you can check out the tool on the website here - ¬†[elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-sunday-promo-1202-02).

there are a whole lot of videos here in this [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plpv207ven3s1hmfcq9lqg74erzjicbmoy).

**you can try the app for free for 30 days.**

i will appreciate your support and feedback.

thanks."
"there is something wrong with the mouse, cursor, and magic trackpad 2 in m1/m1*/m2 macs. this is gonna be quite a long post but **if you are also affected by the mouse cursor stuttering and jumping, either with the internal trackpad or with the external magic trackpad 2 feel free to chime in and share your results, experiences, workarounds etc.** anything that would help the community to overcome this issue.

&#x200b;

# background

i bought my first arm-based macbook air 2 years ago as a backup device. my main workstation was still my intel mac. whenever i used the m1, i noticed some cursor stutter after about 20 minutes of working or so. it's like the refresh rate for the cursor suddenly drops to like 24fps.

this is not the general slowdown that you experience when the cpu is busy or the memory is full. it can happen when doing nothing but clicking through items in the finder with nothing else ressource-hungry going on in the background,

what ""fixed"" it for a few minutes was to close the lid, open it again, maybe repeat that a few times and the cursor was back normal. this has already been discussed a lot in threads on reddit and i'm surprised to find the exact same issues still being present after more than 2 years of arm macs.

&#x200b;

a few weeks ago i had to upgrade my main workstation (intel macbook) to an arm-based mac. i set up my magic trackpad on it. of course, each new device can feel weird at first but after the first hour of using i noticed that i am still kind of unsuccessful at hitting buttons, marking text etc.

\- everything felt imprecise,- the refresh rate would randomly drop like i know it from my 2020 backup mac,- additionally, the cursor would take random jumps¬†of like 5cm/ 2 inches across the screen.

my productivity dropped as i had to second-guess and correct each cursor movement to get there where i wanted to get. my wrist started hurting on that very day (wrist joint issues were the reason i had to purchase a magic trackpad 2 a few years ago in first place and i absolutely loved the trackpad ever since).

&#x200b;

# radio?

i had somewhat similar issues when first moving to a usb-c mac (the first intel that required dongles for hdmi, usb etc.) when using a third-party dongle as this has disturbed the radio on the mac. so back then i bought the original apple dongle as well which solved these radio issues (also discussed in great extent across reddit).

this case here is not about radio tho, i also experience these issues when not being connected to an external screen, and not having the dongle plugged in.

&#x200b;

# third party apps?

some forum post said that third party apps cause this, so based on apple support's advice i went into safe mode and only used safari for my work, no external screen, no other apps opened: same results.

&#x200b;

# comparison with intel?

thinking i'd go crazy i placed my old intel mac at the exact same spot on my desk to see if this suffers the same problem. i was blown away at how smooth the magic trackpad cursor was on my intel mac. it felt like it had twice the refresh rate, twice the precision and none of the pain that comes with using the arm mac. i need to mention that the intel and the arm mac have the same apps installed because i transfered the whole installation from the intel mac to the arm mac.

&#x200b;

# comparison with other macs?

as i know the next step would be a replacement device, i was curious whether that would fix things. to cancel out any issues with apps on my arm mac, or with my arm mac's hardware even further, i've tried a few friends' arm macs (these friends also all know the cursor refresh rate issue on their arm mac but don't use a magic trackpad). needless to say, the exact same issues started happening with my friends' computers as well. i attached my ""old"" arm backup mac and the issue happened on that device as well. to give a short summary:

&#x200b;

\`\`\`

m1 air 2020 on macos 12.6: problems

m2 air 2022 on macos 13.1: problems

intel pro 2018 on macos 12.6.2: no problems, smooth cursor

\`\`\`

(tested with more devices too but this cancels out any macos version issues)

&#x200b;

# radio part 2 - connection via cable?

then i found this thread:

[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363) (21 ‚Äúme too‚Äù)

for testing, i‚Äôve connected the trackpad via a lightning cable. it is way better that way. is it possible that the radio in the macbook air m2 is much weaker or placed unfortunately? it really isn‚Äôt usable with the arm-based macbooks.

however, the connection via cable isn't perfect either - while working, after a few days suddenly the cursor was unresponsive, the trackpad couldn‚Äôt move or click for a few seconds. after that, it went back to being so wonky again, as if the cable wasn‚Äôt attached. frame rate of the cursor also seemed lower and everything felt indirect. as if the mouse driver went into some kind of compatibility mode that doesn‚Äôt do any of the magic that cursor tracking usually involves. like toggling mouse acceleration in windows, it feels completely different and weird suddenly. as soon as that happened, i started mis-clicking buttons again because i constantly either overshoot cursor positions (like going past the button that i intended to click) or undershoot them (not reaching the desired cursor position in the first move). temporarily moving to the intel mac, i hit everything as precise as i used to do. to cancel out any bias, i also did tests where i didn't know which device i was connected to and i could always tell the smoothness of the intel vs the awful navigation in the arm.

&#x200b;

# internal trackpad?

apart from that, as mentioned in the beginning i also often see the cursor stuttering even with the inbuilt trackpad. it‚Äôs like the refresh rate of the cursor drops:

[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253713321](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253713321) (221 ""me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253395232](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253395232) (173 ""me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252777347](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252777347)[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252957160](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252957160) (91 ""me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253672108](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253672108) (64 ""me too"")[https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/qj77mq/cursor\_lag\_continues\_on\_monterey\_m1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/qj77mq/cursor_lag_continues_on_monterey_m1/) (109 upvotes)[https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/u486mi/macbook\_pro\_13\_m1\_trackpad\_cursor\_lag\_issue\_no/](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/u486mi/macbook_pro_13_m1_trackpad_cursor_lag_issue_no/) (125 upvotes)

&#x200b;

# trackpad / radio / cursor delay?

additionally, i've taken slo mo recordings to measure the delay between my finger moving on the internal trackpad + external magic trackpad and the cursor moving on screen with both processor architectures - i can't find any significant delays that way either. so it doesn't seem to be a latency issue.

&#x200b;

# verdict

my best guess till now:

* arm macs have another set of mouse drivers, causing the refresh rate to drop
* arm macs have another set of mouse drivers that have different curves for interpolating and accelerating signals.
* arm macs have some additional radio issues, that don't cause all of the problems, but add to them

in any case, my wrist hurts. doing the lightning cable thing already helps a lot but i still need to restart the computer every few days due to the above-mentioned issue of the cursor messing up even on lightning. also, even with the cable attached, it still doesn't feel as direct and smooth as on the intel mac.

&#x200b;

# how to go from here?

i've spent way too much time on this problem already but i'm required to use a macos device for work and right now it looks like i will have some bad time ahead in the next few years if there is no solution in sight. if you have any info to share, let's work together to be either to either find a workaround, or gather enough information so apple can finally acknowledge the problem and address it."

"i hope/suspect apple isn't letting another ai opportunity slip **generative ai**  is here to stay and change our way of living once again. they‚Äôre in their infancy, but getting better very rapidly. big tech companies understand this new ai as a massive part of all our futures. staking a claim and building a leadership position is as important as dominating the web was in the 90s.

microsoft announced a new conversational search feature you can start using right now in bing and the edge browser. google on the other hand just shot themselves in the food with panicking and rushing their bard thing. 

**where is apple in all of this?**

apple has the tools to build its own generative ai with the neural engine built into iphone and mac chips that is capable of up to 15.8 trillion operations per second, along with core ml and machine learning apis. after all, apple spearheaded ai once with siri....but we haven‚Äôt seen any movement jet

***conclusion:*** apple has positioned itself as a technology leader for years now. i don't think they are so badly lead, that apple will give that up! of course, apple is one of the most secretive companies in tech, especially when it comes to software. apple could have big teams working hard to bring generative ai features soon. (they bought at least o ne generative ai company: ai music) i hope we get a surprise at a coming wwdc: world-class generative ai all over apple‚Äôs products! (i really hope that‚Äôs the case, because if they are late to the game on such a transformational technology, it‚Äôs going to doom its software to being years behind its competitors)

what apple learned from skeuomorphism and why it still matters 
"iphone users - do you want rcs? if apple were to adopt rcs would you find it beneficial? do you text enough friends/family with androids that it would excite you? 

genuinely curious if ios users have any desire for the feature. clearly tim cook doesn‚Äôt think so.

edit 1: results:

so based on the feedback we have a pretty mixed bag. 

1) majority of folks are open to it as long as it‚Äôs not overseen by google (none of you use a gmail already??). which makes the most sense to me, apple will always do it the apple way and would find a way to have full control over it as they always do imo. 

2) lots of you (mainly europeans) who could care less either way. i envy you, it would be nice if this didn‚Äôt even need to be a conversation. please feel free to convince anyone in na to download 1-2 messaging apps to accommodate android users‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll understand our pain. 

3) smaller portion of the crowd are in the hard no camp. main reason seems to be googles involvement or no reasoning given. 

interesting spread of results. i sit in the camp of why not improve the experience for all users regardless of platform if there is a clear roadmap on how to do it? not saying rcs in its current form is the final best option, but it‚Äôs a foundation that can be built on."
"why is spotlight garbage these days? i'm having trouble finding my most-used apps on ios spotlight (i use it as a shortcut). on my macos mail app, it doesn't find people i'm constantly in touch with, if i try to filter my vast inbox to find a specific message. the menu bar spotlight produces way too many (shitty/far-off) results for it to be useful. i thought apple improved spotlight quite recently? did they move the team to the (rumored) search engine project or what? or am i doing something wrong?

(on macos, every checkbox is checked for results in the settings. i'm running the most recent version of everything. it's been a while since i updated, so everrything should be well indexed by now.)"
scammers posing as apple with logo and all. got my mom! they block computer and get the victim to download anydesk or similar app (remote access) it is easy to blame the victims here but scammers depend on na√Øvet√©. they blocked my mom‚Äôs computer and popped up an apple logo with a similar apple number. they told her that she couldn‚Äôt use her phone or ipad because they were all compromised and then guided her to download remote access anydesk. why was that so easy? we need to work together to make this more difficult. just telling older people or the less savvy not to to do it won‚Äôt work. more security is needed in my opinion. it was too easy to get this free anydesk app. please help apple!

"heads up: new iphone and watch trade in boxes can cause confusion i just wanted to share here a new issue that i dealt with this year, that i haven‚Äôt previously experienced, to hopefully save someone else the trouble.

previously when i had traded in my iphone and watch, i recall the boxes being a bit different. this year i traded in both, and i received two boxes that to me were identical. they both had instructions for the phone and watch, i recall no clear marking to indicate which was which. i‚Äôll tell you why this mattered.

i accepted a trade in of my phone for $550, and $155 for my watch. apparently, i mixed up the boxes (still not knowing how i could have known the difference). this resulted in my phone being sent as trade in for the watch, and my watch being sent as trade in for the phone.

now since i had sent a $550 device in place of a trade in for a $155 device, apple sent me a gift card for the difference. since i sent in a $155 device in place of a trade in for a $550 device, apple had to charge me the difference.

so i ended up having to pay extra out of pocket than originally planned, and the only saving grace is that i now have an apple gift card for the difference. which isn‚Äôt really what i wanted, i wasn‚Äôt planning on spending any more money in their store for a few months.

i apologize if this is hard to follow, but the psa here is this: if you trade in a phone and a watch at the same time, be very sure you know which box is for which, because if you get it wrong the whole process is super confusing and you‚Äôll pay more than you intended to."

there are several probable scenarios in which apple has a chance to take the lead in the ai race. for one, they have already made significant advancements in on-device processing, which could serve as a foundation for further improvements. they have also announced an ai summit event later this year. additionally, apple has a reputation for keeping their cards close to their chest, so it's possible that they are silently working on something revolutionary.

the competition in the ai space is fierce, with microsoft and google both making giant steps forward in recent months. it's not just a battle between these two tech giants, though, and many people are hoping that apple will soon join the fray. bing's reawakening and google bard's offering coming up to everyone. 

the future of ai is uncertain, but one thing is for sure: the competition is heating up. whether or not apple will be able to go to the next level remains to be seen, but the advancements being made by other companies serve as a reminder of the gigantic steps that companies have to take in order to stay ahead of the game. it kind of feels like 10 years ago when we had a new smartphone release every week... we tried all kinds of new ui features, and the ios vs android war was full steam, i'm excited to see what's gonna happen!

what do you think? will siri ever become more intelligent? how do you see apple fitting into the ai landscape in the future? let's have a discussion!"

"protip: inserting text in a hyperlink within apple notes on ios there isn't a easy way to create hyperlinks in apples notes for ios. in apple notes on macos, you can easily insert a hyperlink by selecting the text you wish to create a link to and pressing cmd+k. this allows you to create custom text for a hyper link. 

i've found some sort of bug (or hack?) to get this to work on ios. here's what you do:

1. copy and paste link into your note where you want it
2. move the cursor within the link by holding down on the space bar and dragging the cursor
3. type whatever text you want
4. delete the front and back ends of the remaining link

it's not ideal, but it works. thought this might be helpful üôÇ"

"apple health & fitness future? hey everyone,

as someone who recently switched to apple ecosystem, i am trying to learn more about the products and how to build up my ecosystem with meaningful additions. the way i do it is that i search for the products and examine their current state / features and what is coming. in general i am really satisfied with my mbp and iphone.

however, as a pervious garmin epix2 owner (now awu), this is where i feel apple lacks the most and thought it wouldn't be the case. i am not an extreme athlete, i don't need gps tracking or outdoor stuff trackings - i am dude that goes to gym, doing strength training. so in terms of 'workout' support, i am not that interested in that.

what i find garmin does way better is the features like: stress management, body battery, readiness score , morning report, step counting, and ..  most interesting to me, insights. 

at the moment, i have following apps: autosleep, heartwatch and athlytic (+ centr for fitness app). there is no fitness+ in my country. i did pay for the premium, but i still find it lacklustre, compared to garmin or even fitbit (i tested pixel watch for a while). 

i do not like the idea of having soo many third party apps, but if they would provide me with data the way i imagine apple would do (nice ui/ux, straight to the point, no need to be data scientist to understand insights, etc.), i'd be completely fine with that.

so i came here wondering, if any of you have any info on what is apple's plan in regards to health & fitness features? i learned that they have a dedicated executive role for apple health, so i would assume they would make big leaps here - but couldn't find any info on roadmaps or future features.

did i do my research poorly and the apps i chose are simply not the best for this? then i would be happy to test some you would suggest for me. for me, i don't need lots of raw data, but rather explanation of data and what can i do about it or what does it tell me about me / my pattern.

  
examples:

\- you had only 10min of deep sleep. it is advisable to have x amount for your age and goals. try going to sleep at y time and do \*this\* before going to bed.

\- you did only 100 steps so far. it is recommended to do at least xxxx steps per day. to target that goal  you need need to do 250 steps per hour. get moving now! (and it would actually track steps, not the 'stand time' like apple watch does).

\- your hrv was quite low during the night and your rhr was a bit increased. it seems you did not get enough rest during the night, so track your readiness score throughout the day. if you would like to exercise today, try having a nap in afternoon.

\- etc.

now it could be autosleep  / athlytic / heartwatch does say that somewhere amidst tons of numbers and data, but i would like to have it as an 'insight' section or a push notification."

"what‚Äôs up with apple‚Äôs design choices in recent years? they‚Äôre just all over the place it seems like, between being unsure of what color schemes to stick with (see mac desktop models in primary pastel colors vs. iphone/ipad/watch/macbook colors remaining pretty much neutral/industrial) and the fact that apple cannot decide on what screen bezel design they want to move towards, where is the consistency?
like most of the industry at this point, they are trying to move away from notched phones and towards fullscreen-ish designs, but while introducing the dynamic island design to iphones/just starting to move away from the notch, they‚Äôre now implementing the notch in previously-fullscreen macbook models‚Äîall while the ipad has moved to a bezeled fullscreen design. additionally, apple is still pushing the square-edged iphone/ipads while the watch line still retains the pill-shaped bodies of older iphone models, seen from the iphone 6 to 11 models.

does this inconsistency seem apparent to anyone else or am i just nitpicking? how do you feel about the trends in apple‚Äôs design choices of recent years?"

"what do you do with your macbook, and what can you teach me? my m2 max got delayed so i thought to make this post to help fill my void. i‚Äôm looking for a bunch of ideas and suggestions on what i can do with my new computer. for some context, it‚Äôs my first mac. i had a pc like 10 years ago and finally needed to update and since everything else i have is in the ecosystem i went with a macbook this time. 

i‚Äôd love to learn new things such as coding, whether it be in app development or in data science. i have friends that do both and it seems interesting and fun. i have started to get into photography as well, i have a 13 pro and i love taking photos with it. i do a lot of cooking and frequently write down my recipes and take photos in case i ever want to create content. 

what do you guys use your macbooks for? what programs do you recommend? any specific courses for improving my skills or learning new ones? i‚Äôm in my mid-late 20‚Äôs, don‚Äôt even work in my degree, and might be looking to move to a new city, so if i get good at any of this stuff i‚Äôll definitely switch it up haha. 

thanks for your help everyone!

edit: to everyone telling me to cancel the order, half the cost of this was covered so i‚Äôm paying 2 grand for a 4k machine. i‚Äôm not cancelling, i‚Äôd rather have an overpowered machine that i can learn to utilize in time rather than one that i‚Äôll need to upgrade again later. i appreciate you guys looking after my wallet all the same."

on the android side all anyone seems to care about are foldables, and now each oem is really trying to make their own ""thing"". pixel wants ai, computational photography and automation to be its thing, and these are useful, but far from earth shattering. it all just doesn't feel as exciting as it once was, everything is plateauing. i'm so bored looking at benchmarks and tiny little tweaks to numbers.

i'm curious to see where you all think the industry is going? are phones simply an upgrade every 2-3 years now thing or is the industry going to rock itself again? has the industry matured and have we reached (or are near) peak smartphone?"

"i created a smart diary that allows you to have your own ai. called moolight - smart diary [download moolight - smart diary](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/moodlight-intelligent-note/id1631169735)

instead of writing a long journal, i love taking short notes throughout the day, in a bullet point format. in this way, i could better record the thoughts that could otherwise be forgotten.

my girlfriend writes diary every day. the problem she had is that after writing for years, there is no good way to see the changes in yourself, even though all texts are there.

we tried very hard to search for an app that could fit our need. but failed. **as a result, we took a lot of time to learn and develop our first take on this idea. of a smart note app.**

**moolight** is our answer. it features an on-device ai that could help us organize the piece of ideas into 15 categories. and try to provide some insights and feedbacks from all the notes automatically.

we don't want to sacrifice any privacy, as a result, a decision is made to keep all data to yourself & your own icloud. after tested out the idea, we found a way to make it even smarter and fit your own record style. as a result, you could train your absolutely unique ai on your device in moolight.

the more you write and correct the category, the better your own ai gets. in our own test, with the default ai, the accuracy is about 70% correctness. if you write for about 20 days with 5 bullet points per day, and correct the category. your could own a unique ai that do chores sorting out your notes 100% categories correctness for all your notes.

&#x200b;

**why bother creating another note app?**

complex tools makes it's easy to get lost. when using simple tools, the notes could easily scattered everywhere. why can't software help? we live in an age when technology advances every day, yet the software for notes seem to become unchanged since long time ago.

that's why we spent long time, realizing this idea. and had great fun developing this product. the idea is about writing without being disturbed. enjoy the ease of use brought by technological advances while having absolute privacy.

&#x200b;

**design thoughts**

my girlfriend is a data scientist, and i had background in software and design. we wanna to combine our experiences, and attempt to give this idea our best effort. since day one, we discussed and settled on the following ground rules:

1. we believe everyone should be the sole owner of our data, especially in a case for note or diary. so data never leaves your device or icloud. all data should be processed on-device with neural engine. it should be 100% functional when offline.
2. we wanna it to be smart, to make life easier. to do this, it should know how we feel when we write; it should know the realtime weather so my gf don't need to type in manually; it should know i'm writing about food, without specifying the category. it should be able to track anything that we ever want to know if we wrote about it.
3. we wanna it to be able to think. to write a short headline each day and help us recall. it should know the top content i'm constantly writing about, and use my data to give us some feedback. we wanna it know them all, yet do not ask for any information besides what i actually write.

&#x200b;

**why there are three tabs?**

today, gallery and insights.

the idea is that whenever you want to write something, it's in the today tab, this is where you focus on the moment. when you want to have a look at the past. all the information is well organized and truthfully present to you in gallery tab.

we can't predict the future. however, in some way, we could also get a glimpse of idea about future based on what we were doing in the past. this is what insights tab do.

‚ñ∂ today ‚óÄ ‚Ä¢ bullet based input ‚Ä¢ automatic added weather & location ‚Ä¢ mood lights to know your feeling ‚Ä¢ time travel to past and future ‚Ä¢ dynamic background that flows.

‚ñ∂ gallery ‚óÄ ‚Ä¢ refined card with mood color ‚Ä¢ daily auto headline ‚Ä¢ auto classification for each input ‚Ä¢ powerful search by time and types.

‚ñ∂ insights ‚óÄ‚Ä¢ cumulative days, and inputs count ‚Ä¢ weekly glance to be surprised ‚Ä¢ keyword to know what mattered ‚Ä¢ track anything as tags ‚Ä¢ know what made you happy with mood trend ‚Ä¢ random show to recall memories ‚Ä¢ mapped journey to mark your path ‚Ä¢ liked/web records to shortcut ‚Ä¢ customize modules on your preference.

‚Ä¢ icloud sync and backup for iphone/ipad/mac ‚Ä¢ face id for additional safety ‚Ä¢ customize color, typography, etc ‚Ä¢ recycled bin for accidental delete ‚Ä¢ automatic light and dark mode.

&#x200b;

**what can it do?**

**‚Ä¢ intelligent classification**

declutter the life events. work, food, study and so on. it just knows.

**‚Ä¢ understand your mood**

how‚Äôs your day? moolight will do the best guess.

**‚Ä¢ multiple organizers**

event, emotions, keywords, maps, etc. multiple ways to visualize the data.

&#x200b;

since it's unlike any existing note or diary product in the market. it takes time to get familiar with moolight, and once you get familiar with it, hopefully you'll grow the love of it like we did. moolight is released to the app store on the first day of 2023. and we're still trying very hard to polish it.

would love to hear your thoughts about it."

1. charging obscene prices for storage

2. having 8gb of ram in 2023 in a $1000 laptop

"psa: don‚Äôt let apple deny your request to update date of purchase for a brand new previous-gen product. had to escalate to manager level to get them to do it. just got off the phone with apple in what was an super frustrating experience from a company that brags about its consumer-friendly policy. 

i just bought a series 6 from an online retailer just last week and set it up today. after set up, i noticed that it said ‚Äúcoverage expired‚Äù. weird but no biggie, i‚Äôll just call apple and it‚Äôll be sorted out soon. or so i thought. 

first csr asked me to provide proof of payment which i gladly did. i even screenshared my phone to show the receipt in my email. he asked me to upload my screenshots. no problemo. he then transfers me to another csr.

i‚Äôm 20 minutes into what i thought would be 5 mins. the second csr informs me that due to the fact that it‚Äôs a series 6 they can‚Äôt update the date of purchase. excuse me? i bought it brand new from a reputable retailer (sportchek). it wasn‚Äôt open box or anything. the box was sealed. the csr gives me this gem: because the aw was shipped to the retailer in 2020, they cannot update the date of purchase. 

this was shocking to hear. i told her that it doesn‚Äôt matter to me as the end consumer when a product was shipped to the retailer. i bought it new and they have to honour the manufacturer‚Äôs warranty. she transfers me to her manager. 

i‚Äôm now 45 minutes into this call. manager gets on the phone and asks me what the issue was. i explained how i‚Äôm being told that apple does not cover its own new products just because of when they were shipped to a retailer. she apologizes and agrees with me and goes ahead and approves the update to the date of purchase. finally!! 

took me almost an hour on the phone to get done what should have never been an issue in the first place. so do not let apple reject your request to update the date of purchase if you bought a new apple product. consumer laws exist to protect the end users from this sort of bs."

"discussion: the friction between using an iphone and windows computer i have an iphone. i also have a windows pc at home and use a windows pc at work. i use the windows pc at work because i must, and i use the windows pc at home because it‚Äôs a requirement for my online business administration degree. additionally, i've always liked windows because it's what i'm used to. 

most of my personal life is on my iphone. the native calendar, reminder, and notes app all seamlessly connect to help me manage my life and be productive. i have notes integrated with the reminders app and reminders set out way into the future. this runs my life.

i‚Äôm really loving using windows more and more every day. whether it‚Äôs for school, work, or for personal use. the programs i‚Äôve used are so feature rich. they‚Äôre a pleasure to use and find out all the possible capabilities that can help me be productive. lately, i‚Äôve been learning more and more about excel and onenote. it‚Äôs honestly been fun and i‚Äôm enjoying myself quite a bit.

this leads me to a point of friction. i love using windows app‚Äôs on my pc, but my whole life is wrapped up on an iphone which i also enjoy. the webpages for iphone apps are quite garbage (looking at you apple notes). i‚Äôm considering making the switch from apple to windows and migrating all my notes and reminders to windows apps. 

my question is this: is it worth it? for those with an iphone and windows pc, which apps do you use to manage your personal life? are you frustrated with the limitations? more generally, what is your workflow?"

"why do modern ipads have worse battery life than older generations? my first apple product was an ipad air 2. which i love, and still have to this day. i got an ipad pro 2020 two years ago, and have been using it and have my older air 2 to my mom. 

recently i was using the air 2 again, and realised it had such a better battery life vs the pro. despite being several years older (battery deterioration), it has crazy good standby time and lasts longer whole browsing or watching videos. have apple optimised their newer ipads for more power vs battery life? 

i have to say i feel like i need to charge my ipad pro quite often. while only browsing and consuming media."

**video description:** some are arguing that the new 2nd gen homepod could be a tough sell for apple, but i've always wondered if a stereo pair of homepods could make a formidable system. is a pair of new apple homepods good enough to best soundbars and other powered speakers as a full home entertainment or home theater system? i think you'll be surprised by what i found out."
"the next version of airpods max need to be substantially better. i've been using my wired headphone setup and app2's for a while and decided to put on my dusty apm's to see how it sounds. the noise cancelling is significantly better on the app2's. also, the app2's are lighter, have more battery life, have a case that makes sense, and they sound better. the max has a more distant-sounding soundstage, but not wider than the airpod pro's. apple has their work cut out for them for the next version of the max. i don't think i would recommend the current version if it was sold for $200. they can't be selling many units as the product stands in the market right now."

i also use a high resolution ultra wide screen and that alone was heating up my previous mbp due to the strain on the gpu.

before, even video calls would have the fans blow like crazy. now i have yet to find a task that makes the m2 sweat even a little bit.

"i've just released pestle 1.4 with smart folders, pdf import, image import and more! hey r/apple! 

i'm will, a 20-year-old developer from adelaide, australia. i build [pestle, an intelligent recipe manager for iphone & ipad](https://apple.co/3sweywl) (the mac version is coming along well, and it will be worth the wait!).

if you're not already familiar with pestle, [checkout the launch post from 6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/sgctww/ive_just_released_pestle_transform_any_recipe/). but in short, pestle is a recipe organiser that lets you save recipes from any website.

# smart folders

this is one is really cool! pestle now has 'smart folders', which fill themselves up based on the criteria you set. want to filter your 400 recipes down to just 4-star or higher desserts that aren't alcoholic beverages? easy! as you save new recipes to pestle, they'll automatically be added to your smart folders.

# pdf import

this one is for those of you with cookbooks as pdfs. pestle can now show you your pdf cookbook and will guide you through adding your favourites to pestle. once saved, pestle will use its smarts to enable you to scale recipes, convert them, and more. 

# image import

much like pdf importing, pestle can now handle photos you've taken of recipe cards and the like, with live text on ios 16, scanning photos into pestle is a breeze.

### search improvements

this is a smaller one, but worth a mention. sometimes when searching across your large collection, exactly _why_ a recipe shows up might not be clear. you may search for ""italian"", and a recipe with ""italian herbs"" will show up. now search results will show in the top right exactly _why_ they're there, like ""matches ingredient"" or ""main course"".

# privacy first

frankly, it's none of my business what you cook with pestle, where you share it to, etc etc. that's why the [privacy policy](https://pestlechef.app/privacy) is so short, there's very little for me to say. first and foremost, **pestle does not collection identifiable information** (with the only exception of your email, if you even consider that identifiable, and also only **if you use email signup**, if you use sign in with apple/google, then this doesn‚Äôt apply. for analytical purposes, i do track daily active users, version breakdowns and such. **but none of this information is tracked back to you, it is 100% anonymous**. i use [telemetrydeck](https://telemetrydeck.com), a privacy-focused platform use by many other popular apps, such as apollo for reddit.


that sums up this update, it's my biggest update since releasing live activities (among other things), so i hope you like it :)

i would love for you to give it a try, so go get [pestle on the app store](https://apple.co/3sweywl)!"
"if you travel often using public transit you might find glarm useful. it‚Äôs an app that notifies you whenever you‚Äôre closing in on your destination and it‚Äôs been recently updated for ios 16! [glarm is available for free in the app store](https://apps.apple.com/app/glarm-location-based-alarms/id1523237367)

if you‚Äôre like me and you travel a lot by train, or bus you might not always recognize railway stations or tell quickly how far is your stop, so you start nervously checking the time and position on the map.

with glarm you can set alarm to ring, let‚Äôs say 5 kilometres from your destination and in the meantime, take a nap, or watch a movie without worrying about missing the stop.

**it was recently updated with support for live activities on ios 16** so now you can track the distance from the destination on your lock screen.

let me know what you think about it and have a wonderful sunday!"
"i just released oolong v2, a ""future forward"" budget app that can help you control the ""shape"" of your money! hey /r/apple, 

just launched oolong *v2* after two years of doing other... stuff üôà

#### [get it here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1549289924)

---

**tl;dr:** 

oolong is a ""future forward"" budget app that helps users control the ""shape"" of their money. whereas other apps like mint, ynab, and [envy](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/q5dd4a/i_created_a_budgeting_app_that_doesnt_collect_any/) are great at helping users understand ""what happened"", oolong is all about predicting ""what *will* happen"" so that you can make smarter financial decisions **today**.

---

**what's new?**

oolong is the reason i picked up ios development 3 years ago. the [original app](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/) was, admittedly pretty basic, but it got the job done! this latest version is everything that i've learned a lot about building enterprise apps over these last couple years along with: 

- completely new design (as requested by [/u/darpyface](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glj008n/))
- balance sheets and income statements
- multiple accounts (as requested by [/u/john-mcafee](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glicfor/))
- decimals! (as requested by [/u/lizadting](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/gli07qb/))

---

**use cases**

i've been using the oolong methodology for over a decade (then just an excel spreadsheet). it's the singular tool that i use to manage my money. hearing from several v1 users, many have used oolong to: 

- figure out how much to allocate to savings/investments
- plan major one-time purchases
- figure out ""how much apartment"" to rent/buy

---

**freemium**

oolong is free for the first 3 accounts (assets/liabilities) and 7 plan items (incomes/transfers/expenses). an ""in app upgrade"" can be purchased to unlock unlimited accounts and plan items, as well as remove ads.

i really think that oolong can help users escape the ""paycheck-to-paycheck"" trap. so, if you use and love oolong, but can't afford the upgrade right now, please send me a quick email at oolong@bracket.ltd with a little explanation about how you hope to use oolong to improve finances and i'll endeavour to send you a code!

"is this the mandela effect, or did apple announce wireless bluetooth or ncf tags for retailers around 2015?  i've tried looking into this for a little while and i can find no trace of it on the internet.

i swear i have a memory from probably around 2015 of a wwdc video where tim cook was advertising nfc/bluetooth/similar devices to brick and mortar retailers. i cant remember what their value proposition was, but it provided some digital services to customers.  maybe you download apps, order online, or similar - basically a glorified qr code. sorry, my memory is very patchy.

outside of the mention at the wwdc, i have no other memory of it (never saw it on their website, in person, etc). that, plus me being unable to figure out an actual use case for this product, plus not being able to find anything about it on the internet is making me thinking i've just made this up!

does anyone else remember anything like this, or have i lost the plot!?

(ps - to confirm, i'm not referring to airtags)"
3d printable rack mount for the apple mac mini! 
"what is the purpose of making a service appointment? a week ago i made an appointment to get my battery changed. the price is being hiked in march, and my phone is a few years old still on the original battery. may as well change it before the price hike as it is noticeably weaker. (on my 6s i'd change the battery myself, but honestly i cba to replace iphone batteries myself now). 

so i made an appointment online, where i input that i was coming in for a battery replacement, the day i wanted, the store i would be at, and the type of phone i have. i even got the email & text reminder about my appointment this morning, so i drive to the apple store, get checked in, wait for a staff member to be available, start the initial info gathering part of the process.......just to be told the store doesnt have my battery in stock, and they would have to order it and wait 3-5 business days.

what was the point of the appointment?!? they knew when i was coming in, they knew what store i was going to, they knew what type of battery i needed. seriously, instead of a reminder email & text why couldn't i have gotten a message saying we don't have the battery yet, don't bother coming in. why is the battery only being ordered now...after i came in, not when i booked the appointment (ya know, more than 3-5 business days ago).

the ""most innovative tech company"" can't even link their appointment schedule with the apple stores? not even like i was at a third party repair center, it was an official apple store...

"universal control appreciation post so this is an upvote for universal control and a downvote for m2 mba only supporting 1 external display. 

i have a personal m2 mba and a m1 mbp that is my work machine.

two things to know about me:

2. i have been trying to keep work / personal stuff separate 

now i have a set up where the two laptops are mounted on either side of my monitor. i have 3 screens!! i also can control both personal and work with one set of mouse/keyboard which is great. 

of course i still can't share windows across the machines, but i haven't found that to be much of an issue. i usually keep slack/spotify on one screen and do my work on the other two. 

i was pretty skeptical about universal control but i'm actually a pretty big fan of it. it works so much better than i thought it would."
"sharpness of imac 24"" vs macbook pro we got a 24"" imac at work and i'm just amazed by the clarity of its screen? i thought it was the same ppi as the 13"" mbp  and apple even says it's only 218ppi vs the 227 of the macbook. even so, when i'm comparing the imac screen to my (2017) mbp it's definitely sharper. the difference is slight of course but i'm still wondering how it can be. did apple change the panels for true tone and they appear sharper through more contrast?"
2fa apple account will apple allow totp 2fa for authentication anytime soon?. it's a bit primitive having to share a phone number for 2fa.
"never ever ever get applecare through best buy total tech applecare + best buy=weeks of waiting

do not get best buy total tech for your iphone or, probably any apple product. these two companies need to acknowledge that the relationship isn‚Äôt working and it is at the customer‚Äôs expense. honestly, best buy, he or she is not that into you, move on. and customers- neither is interested in you, you‚Äôre just in a custody battle.

on 1/3 i brought my beyond repairable iphone into best buy for repair. i have total tech with apple care so it was fully covered. that all sounds good but what happens after is the most maddening b.s. 

1) the person i talked to at the geeksquad counter looked at my phone, could see it is well beyond repair and said they could not take the phone in because i would need to make a geeksquad appointment because they need to ‚Äúrun diagnostics to see if it is covered by total tech applecare‚Äù. it is. is this something i can look up online on my account myself? he says, ‚Äúyes, you can do that.‚Äù this makes no sense then why an appointment is needed to determine that because if i can look it up (and i already had), why can‚Äôt the geek squad dude standing in best buy who has my account pulled up in his best buy computer not find this information himself? but i don‚Äôt want to make his life difficult because whatever they have going on for an inefficient system isn‚Äôt his fault. i ask if i can get in for that appointment that day or evening. no. it will be 3 days. wait three days for them to look up my apple care. wtf. ok, corporate bullshit has me waiting a few days.

2) 3 days later i make the time to drive back over there again with the same issue-need the phone replaced. the person at the counter this time is more helpful to the degree they can be. she is like, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know why they made you wait and make an appointment we can just do this right here.‚Äù she says she worked in the phone section but that they don‚Äôt cross train which leads to that stuff‚Äîas in being required to make an appointment to verify applecare coverage. and my geeks squad appointment says customer want to verify apple care coverage as my reason for the appointment. um. no, i don‚Äôt, i want to move the repairs forward. i let her know that i appreciated her help and thought it seemed excessive to have to go in twice, 3 days apart just for that. she processed the phone, could see it is unrepairable and charged me for a replacement. she says it may be up to three weeks for them to replace. the phone but it does get overnight shipped both ways. ok. so i have to use an old phone that does not get texts from almost numbers, that does not get data because my sim is 5g and the phone is 4g. but, it‚Äôs temporary, it‚Äôll be fine. it is, however, my work phone so i have to tell everybody that i do not get texts nor do i have data.

3) days pass. weeks pass. i go to applecare to find out what is going on. there is no record of a repair for my phone with them because they run it all through best buy and cut the customer out. you cannot talk to anyone at apple because they have no record of your repairin their system. this leaves tracking a repair through best buy. when that happens it simply says, ‚Äúwe are moving forward with your repair‚Äô or some unhelpful sentence like. no timeline, no deadline, no contact info. 

4) i am now 25 days in from the start of this. i decide to call the store to speak to a human. instead it‚Äôs ai that tells me the phone attached to my number is currently in repair. omg i know this.  i say i want to talk to a person and ai tells me it ‚Äúunderstands‚Äù i want to talk to someone and the wait will be 7 minutes. 5 minutes in someone answers. but it is clear i have been forwarded to a call center.  i explain what i want to know, they tell me they will see what is going on.  hold. they return to tell me that my phone is being repaired.  that is so inadequate. i know this. i want more accountability on that end- what is going on, give me a date, etc. he tells me i should call the store and would i like the number.. no- because that is where i called and got sent out to them.  

5) today i go in to best buy again. they apologize and say they are unable to talk to any human being there and are only able to escalate the order and they say they have been doing it every other day and, will now, on day 24, start doing it daily. and they tell me this is typical of apple with them.

do not get totaltech for your apple device. pretty sure apple deprioritizes their best buy work, best buy gets your total tech money so they don‚Äôt care as it is still profitable for them and you are out your device for weeks on end, with zero accountability on either company‚Äôs end. absolute bs."

"is there an iphone keyboard like android's gboard? i switched from an android to an iphone and i'm happy about it. but i sorely miss gboard on android. i realise there's an ios gboard but it's much worse.

i miss being able to quickly enter numbers by long pressing the qwerty... keys. you can do this on ios gboard but you have to hold the keys for so long!

i also miss being able to use punctuation by long pressing other letter characters. on ios, you have to long press the period key and then select, which is inconvenient.

is there an ios keyboard with these features? i swipe type, if that makes a difference."

"airtag family sharing ü§¶ i can‚Äôt believe apple still hasn‚Äôt added family sharing to airtags. that would be the game winner. every other tracker on the planet has this feature, and apple is still missing out 637 days later. 

‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ

(does anyone see a real reason for this?)"
"spouses sharing icloud accounts hello there reddappleiverse‚Ä¶ my wife and i have been using the same icloud account (my email) on all our apple devices since 2009 mainly because that was the only way to share purchases (before family support) and share a single icloud photo library (before icloud shared photo library). we keep our messages/facetime separate just by unchecking the other phone number unchecked in settings and never giving out the apple id email as a way to be messaged/called. we like that we can use ‚Äúfind my‚Äù to ding either of our devices which i do for her a few times a week. however, it has some annoyances like bugs where it shows missed calls to the other number, and messaging business chat shows up on both devices. other than that, it generally works fine and we are used to it, but i have 2 questions for the hive mind:
1.	does anyone else still do this? are there some other benefits i might not be realizing?
2.	splitting them seems like a good idea but a huge pain. can someone talk me out of this? anyone successfully completed a split like this?"
"security keys, 2fa, account recovery testing i did some testing with and without security keys‚Ä¶

**scenario**: 2fa enabled, advanced data protection enabled, recovery key set, 2 recovery contacts set  
¬†  
apple id password reset - there are 3 options:  
1.	 you must have unlocked trusted device and must know device passcode and then you can change password in settings (can be secured more by blocking account changes with different pin) 
  

2.	you must know a trusted phone number and must have unlocked trusted device to get pushed 6 digit code to reset remotely


3.	you must know a trusted phone number and must have it to receive sms verification code/call and must know your icloud recovery key
¬†

logging in - there are two options:  
1.	must know password ; must have unlocked trusted device
2.	must know password ; must have working trusted phone number for sms/call
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†


!!! note i couldn't see a way to use recovery contacts.¬† apple says having a recovery key set means account recovery is disabled, originally i thought this would just disable the manual account recovery that happens when you phone apple up about it - but it doesn't make it clear this means recovery contacts don't work. [edit] however the recovery key or recovery contacts are still very likely important for recovering end to end encryption keys for icloud. 


___

¬†
**new scenario**: as above but with 2 security keys set as well  
¬†
  
apple id password reset - there is maybe 1 actual option:  
  
1.	you must have an unlocked trusted device and must know device passcode to use settings menu to change password

2.	iforgot.apple.com - pushes a notification to your trusted devices which takes you to do #1 above...¬† or you can alternatively get instructions for #3. it does not apply 6 digit code etc. 

3.	tells you to use apple support app etc.¬† when i try this currently it asks to confirm my phone number, and then takes me to a ""security key verification - to reset your password, verify one of your security keys."" screen.¬† but this is immediately popped over with a ""cannot verify identity - your action could not be completed because of a server error. try again."" message before i even have time to try to scan a key.¬† maybe its suspicious because of all the fooling around i've been doing. this is where imo it should allow you to have the security key and know the recovery key. 

4.	with the same factors as #1 you can also remove all the security keys from your account and remove the restrictions in place but this isn't really a separate option as its the same factors‚Ä¶
  
!!! so in this configuration, if correct, your account is gone if a) you can't unlock a trusted device and b) you forgot your icloud password. as above i don't feel this is correct - you should be able to have a security key + know the recovery key.¬† that said, this scenerio should be very rare?¬† and anybody who loses all their devices and forgets their icloud password is pretty unlikely to know their recovery key :p
  
!!!your account is not lost if you lose all your security keys - see #4 above you can just delete them if you have the factors for #1  

the recovery key or recovery contacts can‚Äôt seem to help you reset the password in this scenario, however they are still important to recover end to end encryption keys for icloud data. 

  
logging in there is only one option:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† must know password ; must have one of your security keys (or see #4 above)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† (that said, i only tested this on icloud.com, didn't try logging in to a new device because pain but i suspect its the same...)
¬†
  
google will let you have security keys plus other forms of two factor. however if you turn google advanced protection on, then it also reverts to only allowing security keys as the second factor. but you can set a recovery contact that they warn will take several days to process."

"is apple mixing and matching nand flash configurations in m2 pro mac minis? so i have just watched four separate youtube videos all reporting the same capacity with totally different ssd speeds . two with a 1tb and 2 with a 512gb m2 pro mac mini. the channels are dave2d, luke miani, iphonedo and mcstudio fpv. the ssd speeds from each channel have get these speeds: 

[512gb getting 3172.8 mb/s read, 2973 mb/s write](https://youtu.be/vbmb_z8qdxu?t=561) 

[512gb ssd getting 4707mb/s read, 2867mb/s write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d3s4xpq830) 

[1tb getting 2860mb/s read and 2388mb/s write](https://youtu.be/aqcpnnxyvcy?t=71) 

[1tb getting 5854.4 mb/s read and 6202 mb/s write](https://youtu.be/1y7njxz-5ku?t=226) 

the two explanations are the youtube channels have mistyped the capacity of their drives, or mixed up their results, or apple is mixing and matching ssd configurations. sometimes using 128gb flash, sometimes using 256gb flash, sometimes using 512gb flash. can anyone verify or shed some insight on this?"

"i thought apple laptops had excellent resale value...? i purchased a base model 16-inch macbook pro for $2,399 plus tax back in november 2019. core i7, 16gb ram, amd 5300m, 512gb ssd, yadda yadda. i've babied it ever since i've owned it and it's in immaculate, pristine condition. i've even kept the original box and documentation. 

i put it up for auction on ebay... and the best price i could get was $750. i was also disgusted by such low ball offers i'm getting on this laptop, both on facebook marketplace and craigslist.

$750? what the hell? i thought apple laptops had amazing resale value? this laptop has no dents or scratches whatsoever. i think it's worth at least $1,300. 

is there something going on here...?"

"anyone else very disappointed with freeform? i was so incredibly excited for freeform to launch because i love collaborating on projects with people for all types of things. it felt clunky to always be using different apps for different things, and i thought freeform would be a great combination of other apple apps (with functionality from notes, keynote, numbers, etc.). 

but after spending this week tying to collaborate with my partner on a house we're building (layouts, floor plan, dimensions, lists, etc.) in freeform, i find myself disappointed over how much is lacking. 

i'm hoping apple adds a lot more power and functionality in the future. 

primarily, i would love 

* the ability to change the dimensions of shapes (like one can do in numbers, keynote, pages)
* change background color, grid, grid type, etc. 
* hold down hand-drawn lines / shapes and have them snap into the shape 
* snap hand drawn lines or shapes to the grid 
* be able to select more than just hand drawn lines 
* be able to select / move / scale / rotate / duplicate groups of objects 
* be able to lock objects 
* have an object tree sidebar 
* have settings or preferences 

curious what thoughts you all have!"

"does the studio display jelly scroll when rotated 90¬∞? the ipad mini 6 jelly scrolls when in portrait orientation [due](https://www.notebookcheck.net/ifixit-explains-why-the-ipad-mini-6-suffers-from-jelly-scrolling.568461.0.html) to its display‚Äôs vertically mounted controller board, whereas displays with horizontally mounted controller boards like the ipad mini 5 or ipad air would only jelly scroll when in landscape mode.

the ipad pro also has a vertically mounted controller board but at 120hz it‚Äôs unnoticeable. 

so it would stand to reason that the studio display at 60hz, when rotated 90¬∞ would jelly scroll. 

has anyone used the studio display in portrait orientation? if so did you notice jelly scroll?"

"apple watch ultra - a great watch, but a terribly-designed watch face. the minute/hour hands completely obscure complications at certain times. i love my apple watch ultra, but why did apple think when they designed the standard watch face? there are certain times of day when i can't read my complications because of the stupid opaque minute/hour hands. the worst part is that it's such a simple fix that seems to be ignored entirely with each iteration of apple watch (unless i'm missing some way of changing the opacity.)"
"heads up re: apple studio display i just bought two apple studio displays. i ordered them with a mac studio max and an m2 air but the computers will arrive in a few weeks and the studio displays are here now. i am currently using an imac 27"" from 2017. my imac is connected to an owc thunderbay4 which holds four 6tb drives. that is chained to another thunderbay4 with 4 backup  drives. the second thunderbay is chained to an owc dock to which i have two fast nvme ssd's for video editing. i connected my new apple studio display to the imac's second thunderbolt port and booted it. it was a no go for the display. studio displays must be connected directly to the mac and they have only one tbolt port (and four usb-c gen 2 ports).  it can't be chained. previously my imac had a different display connected to my owc dock but the apple display can't do that, nor could it boot if my other port on the imac was so heavily used. it turns out (an hour and a half with apple techs that have sent the issue to the engineers) that - apparently - the apple display is power intensive (in spite of it's own power cord) and can't deal with the imac's thunderbolt setup. the imac shares a single controller between the two tbolt ports. i have learned if i boot my imac with  the display connected to one thunderbolt on my imac and then add just one thunderbay and after that add the other thunderbay with the attached dock, then it's all good and stable but the display will not turn on if i boot with everything attached.  my 16"" m1 macbook pro max will deal with all of this attached at the same time so i am assuming the mac studio max will also since the 4 tbolts on the studio  are independent.    thought i'd clue folks in so since i mistakenly assumed my studio displays could be easily connected like my previous eizo display was. btw...the complaints about the studio display's web cam were warranted. i'll be buying a decent web cam. just horrible. worse than my old imac."

"apple should have an all mac event to me it would seem obvious for apple to have two stacked events a year (or every other year for macs) with a 1st quarter event for all things mac (mac mini, mac studio, mac pro, imac, macbook, air, pro, and accessories like displays and other peripherals) and the 3rd quarter event for obviously everything else (iphone, ipad, watch, airpods, tv, homepod, etc.). i know there's probably a reason why they don't do that but i also find it odd whenever they release a product in a press release and not in one of there events. or whenever certain products, like ipads, can either be released in either the first half or second half of the year instead of sticking to a specific release window.

obviously this is just a quick rant and personal opinion but i'd like to know what everyone else thinks and if anyone knows why apple doesn't do this."

"people in the apple ecosystem who got rid of their apple watch, why? e.g. you have an iphone, ipad  and macbook but just don't get along with the watch

 \- you switched to another type of smart watch, if so how is it better for your circumstances?

 \- you realised you didn't need one or found it too annoying, what specifically: charging hassle, it broke too easily, didn't do what you'd hoped, another 'thing' to have to manage etc

&#x200b;

i am considering getting one, but unlike a phone/laptop/computer that i've used for decades, this is an entirely new type of device, so i am interested to know why people felt it fell short enough to ditch it entirely.

for people who still have an apple watch and love it, great! but this is not the thread for you to comment on :d


**edit**: thanks everyone for all your very detailed reponses and discussions, super informative i will read them all and then decide!

**edit 2**: the single biggest issue for most people seems to be the battery life, so for that reason, for now, i'm out. once they get the battery-life up to a week, then i will reconsider. regarding the 'distractions' it's really hard to gauge as i know you can configure it and for every person who says 'it's a nightmare' another says 'game changer' as they don't have to use their phone as often. other reasons include longevity, as other people say, for the same money you can get a watch, though functionally poorer, will last decades."
"windows integration hello everyone, i have a question for people who generally use apple products (iphones, watch, ipad, airpods, ‚Ä¶) but for whatever reason use a windows pc/laptop. do you have any solutions for integration of the windows system into otherwise apple ecosystem? i know that imessages, facetime and so on are not possible but i wonder if there are any solutions for having icloud share to your computer, alternatives for features such as airdrop, perhaps some software to autoconnect airpods while sound is playing and so on."

"world wide returns does not seem to exist bought an apple watch ultra abroad (usa) asked if it would work at home (eu) was told it would work and worst case my right to return was world wide. came home, setup the watch, realised cellular was not working. went to my local apple store to figure it out, they told me us sold watched some not work in europe and i could not return an item bought in a different currency.

it makes sense but it‚Äôs still frustrating, part of why so buy so much from the apple store is the great customer experience, you trust that they will give you accurate information."

"what's connected to your mac? i've outgrown my imac due to 4k video. i'm going to consolidate some smaller ssd/nvmes into other  enclosures to cut down on all the connected drives i have.  as i was struggling to decide what to toss out (any 512gb ssd) and how to organize my external drives i just had to shake my head when i looked at my setup. my main external is an owc 4 bay with each bay holding 6tb drives and that is backed up to another owc 4 bay. some of the drives are partitioned which is why my list of drives looks so insane. here's a screenshot of my drives/partitions. if you have a bunch of drives connected as many of us do, let's see yours and give us a total. i do a lot of 4k video (amateur), hence all the storage.  29tb spread among...[my drives](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bxztqto-5miofnguh2jkskyp8vajkino7bhn6gilmtpuk7_tn9d_bnfpwacxenl0ejqwcdhsdibnldi9cr2ohckwqamjwn8eoq_keirizwyv8safkigvdhkljn81igwatud441cdhtpeansh1raqfxuccczohpuwqcp4kqgfgpjfqehkrolr3bqjzpe1e9zrg2x3xekzp5nhsgctdhvwy_a1b7hb065cirmogj-ellefapvq9uvhs6tirsbq48nxkuskqbgt0fwprqbnnoga4mldqe0uzjnsa48modxvrpm7binxar-iywp3mu2gspipo4zw4pfw9rztlhhwobxpzrnmlkone6u0xhvkggua4axb_vszjjaapaw4hqaqoanonuaxt8eprtzjk1qs9rj7huujebtuqwgtjxhsgtqxou4sqxvwhpe_areacdiip4yfhrbvdoulzsaxswelkoih5vetnklvc1rotxjintwk95qpdgatpyfgyn4yzbrzfpj6gpp3t8mgtoxkakcjrmvq6bsrkluuntuh0h1yhswrxhtjavrpldiyt4_j6dydkyrls8ganzfinfuggawc5tldhcoxsq_qt14j0znhnuq9h08jo4c-x4f8natjb4vvipycwm5xelu7tf8uc9kfpd0x2mh83mtrujrdfpqtguabnxakgrcni6sm9kvbqpecikofaioi7b0sepkxyx8hifq-dibf0cgdfeo_n3in8bm7ceti9db9gnmzufu0uusr2fvyk1khnuk_gsys-ifd7esyuscugy0bktdguoja8mt2vgmatn0ga6jlcxntrnfaovicehzs8a2b_wkqsytm6owqr758vmpgwclfwea8r_hq8xei5vup6kqor4gyg3dntgprz-hsgddqr3zjjvtktbtt4xi7ddbssnui5t9no7tpgysi=w1307-h1224-no?authuser=0)"

there doesn‚Äôt seem to be an obvious way to report these as far as i can see?

my watch has been working well for 2 years and the recent update has even made the battery life better. theres no point in recycling it since i won‚Äôt get any money for a perfectly working watch.

so is there a way to touch up scratches on the watch? so far i haven‚Äôt had any luck finding a paint product that can do that. even my car touch up pain which was a bit darker rubbed off after i try to cover the scratches.

"a lesson learned. avoid buying any secondhand airpods. to start, i will say i'm very tech savvy. today i went to buy some airpods pro gen 2 that i found listed on offer up bnib. i stressed to the seller that i wanted to verify the authenticity before i handed over the money. trust me when i say, these are the best fakes i have ever seen. i checked the serial number on the apple coverage website and it was all green. i connected them to my phone and all the settings that should pop up were there. every single serial number matched; the box, the case, the individual airpods, and even in the settings app. they even had applecare+ until 2025. these things had me fooled for a solid 4 hours, until i turned on transparency mode. i could tell something was off. i went to the apple store and 3 techs were stumped with the authenticity since it even registered on their diagnostics tools and showed a valid sn. the main tell was the font was ever so slightly off on the inside of the lid and the weight of the counterfeit pods were slightly lighter than authentic. moral of the story, do not buy airpods on third party marketplaces unless the seller is willing you meet you at apple and let a tech or two take a look at them.

&#x200b;

tldr: fake airpods are getting almost indistinguishable from the real thing. if buying secondhand or from a third party marketplace, do not trust anyone not willing to meet you at an apple store.


edit: i remember why i unsubscribed from this god awful high and mighty sub. acting like y‚Äôall never made a mistake, awful people. i can also guarantee i‚Äôm more tech literate than any of you negative commenters. i 3d modeled and constructed a dual pc system inside a custom built desk. i‚Äôve built my own 3d printer. i install all my own tech, including a wireless carplay unit. i‚Äôve wired and built my own digital soldering iron. i run my own home media plex server that also doubles as a ubiquiti home security server. fuck all y‚Äôall ‚Äúi guess the bar for tech savvy is low these days‚Äù

edit 2: bnib literally means brand new in box. i opened them in front of the seller. they were not used in the slightest"

"how often do you upgrade your apple devices? i acquired almost all apple devices in the ecosystem because i sold my macbook air 2019 for a custom pc, and now i have the airpods pro 2, apple watch series 8, iphone 11, and ipad 8th gen. i was wondering how often you would upgrade each of your devices. since the airpods and apple watch are still new to me i plan to use them until their lifespan or if they ever if it break down. i still have my 11 which i got as a hand-me-down in 2020 but i don't feel like upgrading right away since it's still good at 85% battery health. as for the ipad i would probably wait till the a12 slow down or if i have to wait for a large upgrade for it. i asked this question mainly because i see people really upgrading their iphones every year or 2 years from a phone plan but i was wondering i often they upgrade their other apple devices considering if they're part of the ecosystem as well."

"new 2023 - icloud won't allow your 4k uhd hdr raw video files to be downloaded rumour has gotten out that icloud has has a secret, but huge, downgrade.

you no longer can select an option to download your content (specifically 4k uhd) video and get all the features. 

if you download direct from the website you may notice all your videos are now in 720p, a huge downgrade from the raw data of 2160p.

a work around is to download the icloud desktop app and let it completely fill your local storage with your library.

this now means the videos download will be in 4k uhd and 60fps. however will lack hdr data from the file. 

i downloaded the same file about 2 months apart and, despite being intrigued by the apparent change to high efficiency, the file is missing additional content. these are the tags for the same file.

"[rant] customer service hung up on me when faced with a difficult issue - twice i‚Äôm curious if anyone has come across a similar situation recently, and if anyone has advice to not run into this issue moving forward. 

a couple days ago my phone (iphone 12 mini) stopped being able to connect with wi-fi. add to that cell towers in my area going down, my phone had no way to connect with the outside world. using my partners phone, i called apple care to try and diagnose the issue. the rep‚Äôs first suggestion was to reset and reinstall the ios. i asked multiple times if this would wipe my phone. i would have to back it up properly first if so, as i can‚Äôt lose valuable information on there. 

she emphatically said multiple times it would not. lo and behold, it did. as soon as i mentioned this, and was quite unhappy as we had directly discussed this, she stopped speaking. the line was open, i could hear ambient noise for about 3 minutes, then she hung up. i later found out she made no notes on the case either. 

just today, i had to call again about an issue with some apple software on my computer. it‚Äôs my primary work software, and the issue i was dealing with is very complex. after spending about 30 minutes on the phone with support, realizing we were going in circles and he wasn‚Äôt going to be able to help, i asked to speak with a supervisor or someone who might have more knowledge on such a niche (but very important) issue. 

similar to the first call, he went silent for a couple minutes, then hung up. i again found out in a subsequent call he didn‚Äôt take any notes about the call. 

has this happened with anyone else? very unhappy with this lack of professionalism and accountability."
"netflix is missing quite a few features on apple tv title, i'm sure i can't be the only one who's noticed this.

not only are we stuck with the old landscape tile design, but we're missing:

\- notifications (including the ability to see what is coming soon)

\- collections

\- top 10 trending

\- no way to remove from continue watching

\- a way to remote control? this is possible across every other tv device i use and isn't limited to google cast, as xbox & playstation both show in the ""casting"" menu (likely using netflix remote control)

&#x200b;

i understand these may be minor features, but the fact that even the ui looks super dated compared to the other platforms just raises so many questions for me. you're paying the same price as everyone else, and being punished for choosing to use the service on the apple tv.

the app was last updated on january 11, 2023 so it's not like it isn't being maintained. they're deliberately holding features back from apple tv users. how is this okay?"

edit: i'm by no means speaking in favor of the community first. i'm speaking in favor of the, unfortinately, evil corporation that needs to please shareholders and sell tons of devices first, then to the community. and as shitty as it sounds, i think it's actually a great deal that we could get an improved ipados ux and ui, along with some tweaks, and let us run most of mac app store apps, just like macos runs ipad apps. that would be enough for me to save for an ipad pro."

"i wanted to use openai's whisper speech-to-text on my mac without installing stuff in the terminal so i made macwhisper, a free mac app to transcribe audio and video files for easy transcription and subtitle generation. would love to hear some feedback on it! when openai released whisper last year ([https://openai.com/blog/whisper/](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/)) i was blown away by how good it was at speech to text. rap songs, low quality recordings, multi language conversations, everything seemed to work really well! unfortunately the setup process required you to install a bunch of dependencies to then have to use terminal for transcribing audio. last week i made a very easy to use mac app to solve this, macwhisper!

quickly and easily transcribe audio files into text with openai's state-of-the-art transcription technology whisper. whether you're recording a meeting, lecture, or other important audio, macwhisper quickly and accurately transcribes your audio files into text.

**features**

* easily record and transcribe audio files
* just drag and drop audio files to get a transcription
* get accurate text transcriptions in seconds (\~15x realtime)
* search the entire transcript and highlight words
* supports multiple languages (fastest model is english only)
* copy the entire transcript or individual sections
* supports tiny (english only), base and large models
* reader mode
* edit and delete segments from the transcript
* select transcription language (or use auto detect)
* supported formats: mp3, wav, m4a and mp4 videos.
* .srt & .vtt export

**which version do you need?**

you can download macwhisper or macwhisper pro. macwhisper pro includes the large model which offers the best transcription available right now and has industry leading accuracy but takes a lot longer to generate. the regular version of macwhisper uses the tiny (english only) and base models, which are still very accurate and fast. depending on your usecase you might want to use the pro version. you can always change what version you want later.

gumroad has a 250mb file size limit for apps that are listed for free so i had to make that part paid. select **macwhisper pro** from the sidebar and pay 6 or more to get it.

gurman: apple prepping 'major ipad pro revamp' for next year 
"""dark patterns"" on trade-in site omg i wish i'd checked here before my recent iphone upgrade purchase.  but apple generally has such great service i never dreamed they would screw me over like this.

i purchased online to replace my wife's phone, because no dealer in my area had what i wanted in stock. got the new phone fine.  and the trade-in process initially seemed excellent - estimated $160 for a 4 generations old phone, sent me a prepaid return box, all good.

then i get the ""revised value"" and it's $55 not $160.  no way i'm taking that, but they will send the phone back to me no charge.

here's where it gets ""dark"" though.  i *accidentally* clicked the ""accept"" button instead of ""reject"".  there is no ""are you sure?"" confirmation.  just ""thank you, you've accepted the offer"".   no recourse, nothing.

i *immediately* went to support.  online customer service can't help, but they take all my information and suggest i try the phone support line.  the phone support person is very nice, but even they cannot reverse the process. 

this is deliberately predatory design, first at the ui level, and second at the business process level."

"user feedback why doesn‚Äôt apple take user feedback seriously? 

let‚Äôs take siri for example. people have been sharing their experiences and feedback for years yet the product is generally not much better than it was on release. sure it received a more fluid voice. but as far as its functionality it‚Äôs highly inaccurate. 

having to tell siri to go away every time it‚Äôs used is simply unintuitive. the phrases it uses are immature at best. for example it will say ‚Äúuhh hu?‚Äù if you don‚Äôt speak fast enough. what in the california!?

siri is has become the substandard of virtual assistants. even pop culture continually rags on it.

apple seems to care so little that it‚Äôs not even listed on the product feedback page.
https://www.apple.com/feedback/

are they afraid of criticism? do they just not like their user base? or are they simply smug?
 
i‚Äôm assuming the latter considering they call their employees geniuses.

p.s. this was deleted from their user forum because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot constructive‚Äù. so maybe they are just afraid of criticism."

"privacy and security at the apple‚Äôs retail storefronts. what safe guards/ security measures are in place during your visit at the apple store. i had a battery issue, the employee asked me to unlock the phone and they took it to the back area. 

what prevents a employee from opening financial apps, photos, wallet? how is my data and privacy protected ? if an employee wants to go through your phone, what is stopping them ?

***update: i called and spoke to someone directly at the store. they said it is normal that a customer would need to unlock the phone before it is brought to the back for battery diagnostics. i'm still a skeptic but i guess i have to take their word for it.***"

"siri on apple tv vs ios i‚Äôve been seeing so many ‚Äúis siri getting dumber‚Äù posts. i agree that this is a concern, a big time one as many use digital assistants for the day to day. i am wondering if, at least partially, it‚Äôs because apple tries to keep a large amount of its operations on the phone itself as opposed to using the cloud exclusively, as well as not getting as much analytical data from users to improve the system. 

i know apple was caught a while back listening and keeping peoples audio without their consent, and i‚Äôm wondering if they were trying to get more data to improve siri, much like maybe alexa and google do/did?

has anyone else realized that siri on apple tv is faster and much better than on the iphone, at least for me? it‚Äôs actually a pleasure to use the siri remote compared to siri on the iphone. i wonder if the apple tv actually uses customer data to improve siri (at least for apple tv). i can‚Äôt speak to the homepod because i have not yet used one.

anyone agree with this at some level? or do you have any other things to add to this topic?"
"how apple has so far avoided layoffs: lean hiring, no free lunches "
"freeform warning: toggling icloud on/off while your boards are syncing will delete them i lost all my school notes this morning after my boards disappeared. despite icloud being on, my boards were not syncing across my devices. i toggled it off and back on and it ""merged"" my boards locally with icloud and all my existing ones disappeared. there appears to be no way to get them back.

a few google searches brought up dozens of threads on apple support forums with the same problem, with everyone effectively losing all their boards."

"dropbox forcing ""files on-demand"" cloud storage instead of local storage i use dropbox to sync my files between a few devices. notably, i want all of the files to remain on all of the devices.

this weekend, i was presented with a message from my dropbox client that it wants to move all of my locally stored files from ~/dropbox to ~/library/cloudstorage. this is a huge pain in the ass, as it will require updating about a hundred configuration files to point to the new path.

much more disturbing, the new dropbox client indicates that all files will be marked as ""on-demand,"" *i.e.*, potentially not living on my devices but only in dropbox. this is alarming, since many of my workflows expect files to be available locally and to be immediately available, rather than waiting to be downloaded from dropbox. it also raises the ugly prospect of discovering that needed files are inaccessible when i'm offline, and being unable to access them (or, at least, without a lengthy delay).

some research revealed [this article from microsoft last year](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-disk-space-with-onedrive-files-on-demand-for-mac-529f6d53-e572-4922-a585-e7a318c135f0#:~:text=onedrive%20files%20on%2ddemand%20helps,new%20information%20about%20each%20file.) regarding similar changes in onedrive, and, further, that these changes appear to have been prompted by apple deprecating some kexts that onedrive had used for syncing cloud storage files. i also found [this macrumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/01/onedrive-mac-users-unhappy-files-on-demand/) suggesting that onedrive users hate this change and find it to be buggy.

i'm extremely irritated by this change, as **i never have and never will rely on on-demand cloud storage for these files**. these files are core to my daily digital life and i expect them to be available all the time on every device and kept fully in sync. i have plenty of local storage space for these files and i am accustomed to managing all of it. so these changes, which not only break current workflows but might introduce new and persistent headaches, are motivated by features that aren't even relevant to me.

i am so deeply irritated by this bullshit that i am now looking at other cloud storage providers that won't engage in this kind of behavior. if i have to blow an entire weekend reconfiguring my machines due to the ghoulish demands of dropbox, i may as well switch to a provider that is actually sensitive to users' needs.

recommendations are welcome."
"why doesn't apple specify nand flash ssd configuration/speed why doesn't apple clarify the speed of the ssds that come in their computers? i feel it is a bit shady that we don't really know what we're buying.

the m2 macbook pro has now famously shipped with a single nand flash for the 256gb model meaning it is half the speed of the 256gb ssd in the original m1 macbook air unless you buy a 512gb model.

i have heard that now with the m2 mac mini, you won't get a dual nand configuration until the 2tb model.

if apple won't give all devices a dual nand config (2x128gb, 2x256gb, 2x512gb) i feel like they should at least specify the rated ssd speed of the device.

when you buy an ssd online you don't just cross your fingers and hope your getting a fast one."

i understand that quick notes are stored in notes but why not just send to notes vs send to quick notes.

"can we get multi-monitor support? like great ux instead of random support? so i love display tech and i‚Äôm a software engineer. so every year i‚Äôm swapping out for a hopefully improved experience. 

i run two macbook pros and they share a dual monitor setup. so i‚Äôm intimately experiencing macos display support.

i‚Äôm seeing an abysmal experience with this setup. 

whenever i switch inputs the macbook never remembers the monitor arrangement and it must be manually set.

when inputs are switched from monitors the other macbook is still ‚Äúusing‚Äù the monitors. meaning that open applications are invisible. the mouse can scroll over to the right or left into invisible monitors which are no longer displaying this computer‚Äôs displays yet they still are shown to the os. 

can we get these issues fixed and create a premium experience for monitors?"
"i was today years old when i learned how warranty exchanges work with apple edit: i was at the \~2 hours away apple store to pick up an order, and in the area to visit family. i brought the defective magsafe duo with me to exchange, having checked to confirm the store had stock. i did not mean to give the impression that i drove there *only* to exchange the magsafe duo. i did not do my homework. no excuses for that. in my weak defence, i've never had to do homework on apple's processes before because they are typically so slick and seamless. i was just surprised i could not simply exchange the defective item for in-store stock, something that i would take for granted at best buy, home depot, or in a purely online environment, amazon.

edit 2: sounds like there may have been a break down in the process at the apple store. other people have reported different experiences in similar circumstances. e.g., they should have agreed to mail the device to me.

mini-rant. drove the \~2 hours to my nearest apple store to exchange my magsafe duo charger, the phone-side charger of which stopped working a couple weeks ago. the unit was still under warranty. despite a dozen or so magsafe chargers sitting right there on the shelf they could not give me one.

>""those ones are for sale.""

had to wait for a genius bar appointment. to submit my request. to have apple ship a replacement unit. back to the same store. the one that is \~2 hours away. they'll let me know when it arrives.

hands down one of the most monty python / seinfeld / curb your enthusiam skit worthy experiences i have ever had. hours later i am still thoroughly flabergasted.

"the new apple tv preview app for windows finally enables 4k hdr playback, including for apple tv+ before, you could only watch apple tv+ in your browser at 480p (not even 720p, because apple loves suffering). 


but the new preview app works really well so far for me. it is playing apple tv+ and my past itunes movie purchases in full 4k quality, and it looks great. hdr is available if your setup is capable. 


here's the link: https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/apple-tv-preview/9nm4t8b9jqz1

it'll cut one or the other for a split second which causes the docked macbook to go to the lock screen (since it's closed and only stays logged in when it's connected to a monitor)

"psa: icloud advanced protection can be enabled with opencore legacy devices just for anyone who's keen to turn on icloud advanced protection on their account, when i first tried to enable it i had 3 devices that needed to be updated before it could be enabled, and my mac mini (late 2012) with an error saying that the device couldn't be updated to the latest os and and had to be removed from my apple id before i could enable it.

what worked was updating the other devices, and then restarting the mac mini once it was on the latest venture update and then it wasn't a problem!

just wanted to make people aware so they didn't end up removing apple devices when they don't need!"
"apple id issues hi all, very long post, tl;dr at bottom. 

on november 24th of 2022 i was sitting down with my family to watch the charlie brown thanksgiving special on appletv. i logged into apple tv in browser on my windows machine (which is hooked up to the ‚Äútv‚Äù). it said i‚Äôd receive a prompt to authenticate with my iphone. 

on my iphone i received a prompt that someone in <a major city within a (long) days drive of me> was trying to access my account. now, i know these things don‚Äôt always tell you the city you actually live in, especially when it‚Äôs actually pretty rural, so i assumed this was myself and hit accept. it then gave me a 6 digit pin to put in on apple tv website, which i did, and we watched the show. 

later that evening i found out while checking my email that my apple id password had been reset. i realized i may have accidentally authenticated someone that wasn‚Äôt supposed to have access to the account, so i quickly attempted to reset my password thru the settings app on my iphone. i was told my apple id was locked for security reasons, and to visit iforgot.apple.com to reset the password. 

on this website it asked for my apple id email and associated phone number, which i provided. fortunately, it seems the phone number hadn‚Äôt yet been changed because it seemed to work. i was told i‚Äôd receive a text in 24 hours to reset my password.  i was like ‚Äúok that‚Äôs not ideal, but i can work with that. i‚Äôd rather not loose my account.‚Äù

now, for background reference, i am a student right now. i do have a part time job that pays ok, but the economy has been real shitty lately, so i have taken up doordash and uber to try to keep putting money into savings for my future. 

aside from the aforementioned windows machine, my only other devices are an old macbook pro, and an ipad mini (i believe 2nd generation but i don‚Äôt know for sure, it was a gift). i require both of these devices to do my schoolwork. 

anyways, back to iforgot, after the 24 hour waiting period, i didn‚Äôt receive any text or email or anything, but i went back to the website and they told me i‚Äôd need to wait something like 2 weeks (13 days or so) to reset my password. at this point i was miffed. my income and my grades were dependent on having my devices functioning, but given the point in the semester i sucked it up and said ‚Äúok, fine. small price to pay for not loosing my accounts right? i‚Äôll just not by any more christmas presents, and work out some plea deals with my professors.‚Äù 

a couple days into this two week period, i log into iforgot to check the status, and it says i can reset my password on my mac. i‚Äôm thinking this is great, way faster than the 2 weeks i was expecting. i open up my macbook and wait for the notification to pop up. it never does. i try running the iforgot steps again (account email, phone number, etc) and still nothing on my mac. the iforgot website says i should be receiving a notification, but it never arrives. 

i tried again to tell it i needed to reset my password and it threw me into another 24 hour waiting period. i waited thru this period, where i was told i‚Äôd receive a message after 24 hours to reset my password. no such message arrived, and logging into iforgot again, it told me i needed to wait another two weeks.  i should also add that on this screen it says that ‚Äúapple support cannot shorten the wait time.‚Äù so now i‚Äôm pretty frustrated, but i don‚Äôt see what else i can do but wait. 

guess what? a couple days later iforgot has the same message about resetting my password on my mac, and repeats the above, i log in, receive no notifications, and the iforgot countdown timer is gone again. 

so i call up apple support at this point because clearly something is going wrong. the first tech i speak with tells me that i need to shut down and leave powered down any devices except the one i want to reset the password with. now i will note, nowhere on the iforgot website does it tell you this, but according to the tech support guy, if the system sees my other devices logged in, it‚Äôll kick me out of the reset process. 

he has me try a couple other methods of reset on each of my devices, none of them working or course. at the end he tells me i‚Äôm just gonna have to wait for the password reset program on iforgot to run its course. he closes my ticket and, a couple days later (after finals and stuff) i attempt, again, to reset my password. 

this time i turned off all my apple devices, save my phone, which the apple support tech *assured* me was allowed to stay on. 

at this point i think you can guess how this went. 24 hour waiting period with the promise of a text or email. no such text or email. 2 week waiting period, which after a couple days, tells me to use my mac to reset the password, i try, but never receive any notification on my mac. 

at this point i‚Äôm into christmas break, and have had no access to my account for nearly a month. i called apple support again, and was asked to try basically all of the above again. then they passed me up the chain to a ‚Äúsenior support tech‚Äù or something like that. this woman, i forget her name, was very kind and understanding, but not at all helpful. she asked me to walk her through everything we tried, and had me try a couple other things (like resetting thru a friends iphone using the apple support app) all to no avail. after several hours on the phone, she tells me it could be an issue with the iforgot security system, but to figure out what it could be we‚Äôd need to run another attempt at password reset with the iforgot system. she tells me that i may not receive anything at 24 hours, even tho i should, but to check it every day, and to use an emailed hyperlink to get in touch with her as soon as i notice the iforgot system has kicked me out of the reset process. 

so we start the process again, and low and behold, 24 hours, no notifications, two weeks hold, and a couple days in it tells me to use my mac to reset (the mac that has been powered off for nearly two weeks at this point, along with my ipad).  as soon as this happens, i open up my email to get in touch with the senior support lady, and lo and behold, the hyperlink she gave me to get in contact requires me to log in with my apple id to function. the apple id that is currently locked for security reasons. 

so seeing no other option, i called back apple support *again* and was put thru all the above paces again, was handed off to a new senior support guy named something like dave or david or something, and he tells me all the same things, has me try all the same things as nice support staff lady, although he‚Äôs very grouchy the entire time. 

i think you can guess at this point. 24 hours. two weeks. a couple days later i‚Äôm booted from the reset. dave only provided the email link that requires apple id to get in touch. i call apple support again, walk the first guy through it again, and am passed up the chain again, this time to a guy named ralph or something like that. 

i should also interject here, that during this entire time i have not been able to do most of the work i normally do to bring in my income, because doordash and uber have had app updates that are required, but i cannot update, because my apple id is locked. so not only am i out my account, and all of its purchases, i‚Äôm also out one of my primary income streams now too, and at this point it‚Äôs after christmas. i have been locked out for over a month and unable to do anything about it. 

ralph tells me that it‚Äôs possible there is some other problem going on that is unforeseen. he asks me to try the iforgot process again, and to let him know when it kicks me out again. and thank god when i bring up that the hyperlink apple support thing won‚Äôt work because my apple id is locked, he says, ‚Äúoh good point, i‚Äôll give you an email you can respond to via email, as well as my office hours.‚Äù 

over new year‚Äôs eve weekend, we try again, 24 hours, two weeks, kicked out, i send him an email, wait a couple days and get a call. he tells me that it‚Äôs possible there‚Äôs some other devices out there that are logged in with my apple id that are booting me from the process. i think about it for a while and am fairly certain that i‚Äôve done my due diligence and that none of my friends or family had my apple id logged in. 

he says it can even be things i wouldn‚Äôt think about like a watch or apple tv. i hadn‚Äôt thought of the apple tv before, but my parents (who live two times zones away) have an apple tv. ralph says he‚Äôs going to escalate my case to the apple engineers to hopefully get this sorted out. 

i call my mom, she double checks the apple tv, and i am not logged in on it. haven‚Äôt been for ‚Äúmonths or years‚Äù according to her. my dad verifies as well a few days later. i let ralph know this by email, he says thanks and that he‚Äôs still waiting to hear from the engineers. a couple days go by and what i get back from ralph and the engineers is basically, ‚Äúoh yeah it looks like one of your devices was still active and is getting you kicked out, but for security reasons we can‚Äôt tell you which one. better double check them all and try again.‚Äù 

at this point by the tone of, and increasing time between, ralph‚Äôs emails i can tell he is getting exasperated by me and or my case. i am also pretty much hopeless at this point. i have had my ipad and macbook powered off all year, all my friends and family have confirmed not a single device is logged in with my apple id, which should leave just my 3: iphone, ipad, macbook pro. the last two of which *have been off all year*. 

ralph has me try the iforgot system again (resetting thru the settings app on my phone), and as i am sure you know to expect at this point: 24 hours. two weeks. use your mac. no notifications. booted out of the system again. 

at some point in the last 2 ish weeks i asked ralph what would happen if someone had compromised the account and actually gotten a device logged in and set up with my id. he said, in a nutshell, ‚Äúwell that would suck, you‚Äôd have to wait for them to stop using your apple id. cuz any time you try the reset process, if anyone is using or even has powered on a device with your apple id logged in on it, it‚Äôs going to kick you out of the reset process. which is unfortunate, but there is nothing i can do about that.‚Äù 

the last i heard from ralph at this point is the message about my devices ‚Äúnot all being logged off and i should please double check‚Äù (they have all been off since before new years). that email was a week ago and i‚Äôm beginning to wonder if there‚Äôs nothing that can be done for my account. 

i am nearing the 2 month mark since this whole ordeal began, and i‚Äôm pretty hopeless. i have had to take extra shifts at work to make up some of the lost income from not being able to dash and uber, and i haven‚Äôt had access to any of my music or movies that i had spent years accumulating. apple support has been completely unhelpful. i don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. 

is there anyone who‚Äôs experienced similar issues? is there any way for me to ever get my account back? i‚Äôd take any and all suggestions at this point. 

thanks for your time. 

tl;dr, apple id was probably compromised back in november and the password reset has been failing for 2 months straight. apple support has been completely useless and not helped anything."

"m2 max gfxbench vs m1 max (screenshots for convenience) m2 max (and m2 pro) gfxbench scores are popping up. here are some screenshots comparing the offscreen benches of m1 max and m2 max as well as some comparisons with other processors. improvements over m1 max seem to range from 33-50%, with a mean of 40% better across 8 subtests

performance scaling seems to be noticeably better across the board than m1 gen in gfxbench for whatever reason. near to above 100% scaling in aztec offscreen, and noticeably better scaling in manhattan

"are there any actual uses for neural engine on the desktop apple first designed their own silicon for their phones. now they are putting these chips in all their devices.

they promote their ‚Äúneural engine‚Äù in every product launch but‚Ä¶ is that part of the cpu actually used for anything on the desktop?

there was a thread on this topic a year ago. it was basically a list of things it could be used for, mentions of photoshop/finalcut and references to faceid on phones.

as a desktop user, this feature seems like potential more than product. a larger gpu seems more useful for me personally but im curious if i am missing something that has actually been implemented.

if there are no uses, i wish they would stop talking about it. if they are going to promote it so much, they ought to better explain what it actually does.

ive seen some comments on using these cores for ml projects but ive heard that the ml libraries for macos are way behind other platforms which use gpu‚Äôs or dedicated ai hardware. this is probably a different discussion. normal consumers are not running ml models on their imac."

"discussion - is bluetooth poorly implemented in ios? across my two latest iphones i've had the same problem: bluetooth is inconsistent and takes time to properly connect to airpods or other bt headsets. this causes a lot of annoyance as i receive phone calls a lot through work and it's rather the exception that bluetooth is connected before the call times out. connecting while in call is a nightmare. i thought perhaps i was a bit unlucky, as googling this problem didn't provide much valuable information.

but my friend moved from android to ios one month ago and he complained about bluetooth connectivity constantly failing on him. 

i feel this is particularly bad given that the airpods should be seamlessly integrated with the apple devices, yet these too fail in rapidly connecting to it's host device.

is this something common or are we both just unlucky?"

"who misses the apple watch edition (titanium version that was replaced by the current aw ultra)? i have a apple watch series 6 edition for over 2 years and its the best $1k i have ever spent with it being the only apple device i have not filed a apple care + claim on. it‚Äôs the titanium version in which i really enjoyed. i beat the living crap out of this thing and its still going strong, while appearing indistinguishable from the basic apple watch. it also actually looks good on my wrist. recently i learned that the apple watch edition was discontinued in favor of the apple watch ultra. i was actually pretty pissed considering that i don‚Äôt need everything that the ultra has to offer, but yet if i want to upgrade in the future i actually will have to chose between the ultra or the stainless steel. better yet it appears too big for my wrist.

for those who owned/owns an apple watch edition. what would be your plan should time come that you would be due for a upgrade? 

go back to traditional watches? get the ultra? downgrade to stainless steel version? or go watch less?

what are your thoughts on the product change?"

"pdfgear for mac - an easy and free pdf program hi everyone. i‚Äôm gordon, the developer of [pdfgear](https://www.pdfgear.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post20230116), which could handle pdfs with easier operations¬†on mac¬†for free. i‚Äôve¬†tried most of the popular pdf programs on the market and found that either the prices are too high,¬†the interfaces are too complicated to use, or converters not supported. so i started to create my own project to process pdf documents, and here pdfgear comes. 

pdfgear is an easy and free program, and most of the functions needed in pdfs are included:

* view pdfs for sure
* annotate pdfs with highlight, underline, and strikethrough with customized color
* write or draw on pdfs freely
* insert shapes at the place you want
* add notes and text boxes
* fill out forms with complete tools, including text insert, checkmark, cross mark, radio button
* sign and stamp pdfs easily
* insert, extract, delete, crop, and rotate pages in easy steps
* convert pdf to word, excel, png, jpeg, rtf, txt html, and xml with ocr! for totally free!
* convert word, excel, ppt, image, rtf, and txt to pdf in seconds! also for totally free!
* merge, split, and compress pdfs, batch supported!

you could download [pdfgear](https://www.pdfgear.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post20230116) here.

as a free program, some users might be interested in how to make money with pdfgear. intending to bring pdfgear to more users and help handle pdfs easier, monetization is off the table for now. as for the future, some of the advanced features might be charged. but that‚Äôs just a hypothetical consideration, and i‚Äôm focusing on developing pdfgear as a better solution for pdf processing at the current stage. so i wish to get your feedback no matter it is a suggestion or a compliment!

thanks in advance!"

"it's just not fair. [app store reviews] i am outraged by the fact that apple only shows app ratings and reviews in the app store by region.

when i want to read people's reviews about this or that application, i often come across the ""no one left reviews and ratings, so we won't show you anything at all"" situation.

https://imgur.com/h6ck7gi

i moved to a country that apparently has few people with iphones or few people who are interested in well-known applications.

ok. why doesn't app store have country/language filters? i want to know what people write all over the world but i don't have that opportunity.

in steam, for example, very conveniently implemented filters by language and all information is available. few reviews in your native language? you can see reviews from people all over the world! and decide whether to buy the game or not.

this is sorely lacking in the app store and i feel it's unfair that the company doesn't allow me to learn more about the app through reviews and ratings from users around the world."
"can we please have better filtering and sorting in the app store? there are so many results i get back, i wish i could sort by rating and popularity, filter by category, paid / free, ads / ad-free, subscription vs one time fee, filter by annual cost. right now i do all this manually and it‚Äôs exhausting to find the app i‚Äôm actually looking for."
"refurb mac studio ""lost"" in transit to apple store - where/how do i escalate this? tl;dr - ups has a proof of delivery of a refurb mac studio to an apple store, apple store says they don't have it. i'm feeling stuck between the finger-pointing (apple says file a claim with ups), and need suggestions on how to escalate as i simply want the mac studio i ordered. what should i do now?

**update**
* first thank you to everyone who replied! today the unit was found somewhere in/about/near the retail store. 
* i had escalated on both fronts including a claim with ups that rejected it with ""contact sender first and create a sem case"" + apple number
* the retail store implied the problem occurred because i ""changed my ship-to address to that the retail store"" which was certainly not the case - i just selected the ship-to-store option/process. that said, my name appeared above ""apple pacific centre"" in the shipping address, but i have no idea why they fumbled/lost it. 
* i suspect the fact this unit was a refurbishment and shipped from elk grove california it may have gotten some manual attention. through this journey i've learned more of the process than i cared for, but do want to send my appreciation to ryan at the vancouver retail store for being kind/professional and helpful throughout.

----------
details:
i ordered a mac studio refurb g14k6ll and chose ‚Äúin-store pickup‚Äù to be safe. a day later i received an invoice/shipped notice and my cc was charged - all seemed well. 

late the day of supposed pick-up (friday 13th), i called apple and was told ""it's at the store"" and noted that i've not received a pickup notice. they transferred me to the store and was told ""no we don't have it in the pos, but call back tomorrow after 10am"". 

i followed-up late the following day via the same process, and this time the call centre shared the ups tracking # and proof of delivery to the store. was transferred to the store again who with the s/n ""went line-by-line"" by their delivery manifest"" to confirm the didn't have it. 

the apple store suggested ""i file a claim with ups"", but is it really my responsibility to do so? i just want my mac studio. i see where this headed - a long investigation and dispute; and i wondered if someone could share further ideas that may help.

thanks!"
"always hitting period key instead of space when typing on safari. this.needs.to.be.fixed. how many others are frustrated by this? i find it very poor design by apple to change the keyboard configuration when using safari. i get that you need the period key more to type in a url. however every time i‚Äôm trying to type in a search on safari i end up hitting the period key instead of the space bar so all of my searches.come.out.looking.like.this. 

i think many of us are so used to the keyboard we don‚Äôt need to look at it when typing. for years now i‚Äôve never been able to remember that when you are in safari the keyboard layout slightly changes. 

i wish apple would just give the option to disable this infuriating keyboard feature."
"apple, it's time to make sync smarter. there have been many attempts over the years to reduce network load, from macos server caching updates for ios devices, through to itunes sync over wifi. but now with many icloud sync, apple don't appear to have made any attempts at making this ""smarter"".

depending on your sync goals, there's one glaring flaw with using a portable device on battery to record content that is cloud synced, it inevitably pauses sync until the device is plugged in, whether you're out on the street, or at home, it won't matter. and it's during this time that if something goes wrong with the device the content is lost.

isn't it about time that sync was introduced as a service on all devices/os' so that when a device is on battery, but on the same network as another device (which is configured to sync the same content), it will then regardless of corded state, sync that new content to the other device via bluetooth/wifi (as appropriate). this serves to ensure that content is securely recorded in at least two locations, it reduces internet bandwidth/load, and is much more timely than double hopping all the devices up to the cloud and back down. the development logistics would be somewhat less complicated than developing an entirely new system beyond introducing ""receive"" sync capabilities on os' ... from there they can either use network discovery, or a cloud based public/private ip matching system (that is, when a device contacts the sync server, it records the public ip, and if the private ip subnet matches with another device, then sync is directed to the local device and not the internet).

the ultimate goal is to make sync more timely and more reliable using the local network where possible to ensure content is in multiple locations, especially if one of those locations is a corded device (e.g. imac, etc).

now, if this is meant to be already implemented and working, then i have absolutely no idea of determining if it's working or not because i have many gigs worth of video on my phone sitting on the desk next to my imac with sync paused because ""reasons"" ..."

"üå™Ô∏è introducing tornado s3 sync üëã howdy, folks! i hope everyone is having an excellent sunday. recently, i released [tornado s3 sync](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344) for macos ventura.

[you can download it here!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344)

a couple of months ago i faced a problem:

**i needed a way to reliably sync the local files on my macbook to my personal amazon s3 bucket.**

i tried other solutions but they were all either too bloated with other file transfer protocols (sftp, scp, etc.), had ambiguous at best data collection policies, or had such a gnarly configuration ui that the thought of ever having to go back into those settings menus sent me running for the hills. all i wanted was an easy to use and configure menubar app to sync my files.

this was the genesis for my first ever macos app, [**tornado s3 sync**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344).

built entirely in swiftui, tornado s3 sync offers users a simple way to reliably backup your mac's files to your personal amazon s3 bucket. below are some of the features that tornado s3 sync offers:

* **secure syncs** - tornado s3 sync makes secure api calls to amazon's published s3 rest apis
* **observability** - tornado s3 sync can notify you of in progress, successful, or failed s3 sync actions
* **set and forget** - once you've configured tornado s3 sync to your liking, you can have peace of mind knowing that your files are syncing on the interval of your choosing
* **absolutely zero data collection** - tornado s3 sync **does not** collect any data about you, your local client, or anything that you send to amazon.
* **no in-app purchases or subscriptions** - i hate subscriptions as much as anyone, which is why tornado s3 sync is a one-time purchase with no in-app purchases or subscriptions.

and that's it! tornado s3 sync is exceptionally uncomplicated, and is, in my very biased opinion, the easiest way to get your files backed up from your mac to your amazon s3 bucket.

as an added bonus, i have 10 promo codes to give away to the first 10 users that dm me!

thank you all, and happy syncing!"

"i made an app that creates music playlists using ai (apple music and spotify) hey i'm a solo developer and released an app that lets you make a music playlist from a text prompt. similar to text-to-image ai, this is text-to-playlist. you can enter something like ""pop artists in the early 2000's"", ""chill electronic coding music"", or ""music similar to the artist taylor swift"". whatever you can think of.

**download link** \-  [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playlistai-playlist-maker/id1631703551](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playlistai-playlist-maker/id1631703551)

there are other ways to make playlists too:

**images** \- upload a picture of a music festival poster (or other image with artist names on it) and it uses apple's image recognition to create a playlist of the artists in the image

**videos** \- upload a video, like a tiktok, that has multiple songs in it and it uses shazam to collect the songs into a playlist.

in the future i plan on making more ways to create playlists and refining the ai. this is a 1.0 release of the ai, it isn't perfect, but it generally does pretty well.

there's a demo video in my launch tweet if you're interested - [https://twitter.com/brettunhandled/status/1613179511218278401?s=20](https://twitter.com/brettunhandled/status/1613179511218278401?s=20)

"if you're a terminal user and find moving things around painful, there's an app for that - clipboard! [get clipboard here](https://github.com/slackadays/clipboard)

when i started out making clipboard, i did so because i found it was painful to do certain things in the terminal like copying a file when i didn't know where i wanted to put it. or maybe it was too slow to type out some long path and hope you got it right in a copy command. or, maybe i needed to copy a file from the terminal and paste it in a browser. either way, i was stuck in a pickle and found myself wasting time and effort.

clipboard changes all of this. i designed it to have a user experience light years ahead of `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` so that any user could get started right away. additionally, you can actually copy real, honest-to-goodness files now instead of just text! best of all, the clipboard app is free and open-source.

i hope you all find clipboard useful :)"

"ulti-planner calendar for ios is now released. we think we have a best-in-class contender for your scheduling needs.  

hey¬†[r/apple](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/)

just wanted to let people know about our new app. with over 1200 new development hours and over 3 years in beta, we have taken our older best selling app's code base and completely rewritten it to be faster, cleaner, lightweight and more reliable to create a new experience on iphone and ipad. this may be one of the most mature and full featured version 1.0 apps you will ever find.

the app features 8 calendar views with a ton of customizations and a new card based ui. other features include calendar text, drag-n-drop, advanced reminders, weather, custom view filters, icons, hashtags, and embedded event lists ... and a few more are cut-n-paste, templates, meeting handling, natural language, and widgets. and...

i think you'll love just how customizable the app is. no more living with a 'red' calendar with a bunch of dots. you can customize the app in a bunch of colors in both light and dark mode, or change to a completely different solid color. and the month view alone has 8 different formats to choose from including text, icons, time bars, or dots.

so please give it a try and see if it can replace your calendar. the basic free version is what a lot of people want, a simple month calendar with calendar text and widgets. and then premium adds all of the advanced views including a new timeline day view along with reminders, weather, icons, hashtags, and quick entry options. you can try that out for 14 days before deciding and our price point is way below similar apps.

thank you!

"getting rid of the airport line seems pretty dumb in retrospect i was never really an airport superfan, but i did like it. when it was discontinued i moved on. looking back on it though, i really think this was a dumb discontinuation on apple's part. there are a lot of examples of beloved and discontinued products whose fans continue to miss them long after they're gone (think google reader). in a lot of these cases, the product in question had a really strong use case for a certain set, but was not economically viable for the business to maintain or make money off of.

but for apple, and their set of home devices (not to mention homekit), just seems like a big misstep to lose this critical part of people's home networks.

\- airport could easily tie into apple's messaging about privacy and include privacy features that are easy to activate and use.

\- airport could act as a home hub for people who don't have an apple tv, or other product. 

\- airport could act as a ""homekit router"" instead of having to rely exclusively on third party products.

\- airport brand and/or technology could be (if apple wanted), integrated into other products. i.e., maybe you can have a homepod that also has an airport router built in, or macmini with router capabilities. (not saying they should have done this, but they could have had the option).

\- apple could have done this with an existing product line, that they wouldn't have had to build from scratch. it was already there, people already liked it. maybe it wouldn't be a huge profit driver but certainly supports the ecosystem at home. 

\- ongoing support for features like time machine backup.

while i'm not saying that any one of these ideas would have been a great use case (i'm not an apple engineer), i am saying that there would be plenty of opportunities for innovation with an apple router in people's homes.

at the time airport was discontinued, it was kind of at the nadir of apple's hardware development (in my opinion). butterfly keyboards, limited ports, etc. but apple has largely been able to recover/adjust course on those missteps. 

the airport line seems like another story entirely. just a huge mistake and missed opportunity for apple to support a key component of people's home internet. not a great move, and i think their home strategy is suffering as a result."

why do you think apple included it?"
"dynamic head tracking spatial audio on video players in safari? solved: call me dumb for posting before trying this but- restarting my macbook fixed it. usually i would try trivial troubleshooting steps like this, but with airpods pro 2 and an m2 macbook? it never crossed my mind that it would be a bug/glitch, i totally assumed everything would just \*work\* so i jumped to other, more complex potential issues like ""maybe only certain youtube videos allow spatial audio/head tracking, maybe there's a setting i have to enable in the music app"" etc. never thought it could be as dumb as ""turn off and back on"" because i expected the apple magic to rule that out from the get-go. anyway, if you're having this specific issue and stuble upon this post- it's the only post about this issue out there as far as i could tell: restart your mac. spatial audio/head tracking absolutely does work everywhere, whether youtube, netflix, iplayer, or whatever else: i can confirm it is supposed to work, even if the content isn't specifically mixed for dolby atmos/surround/spatial audio, it will work, just won't be the fullest experience vs content which is mixed with these things in mind.

&#x200b;

\---redundant original post below---

i'm enjoying testing this out with music, but i feel like it'll be a better experience watching a video or show or whatever. with airpods pro 2, i've tried several youtube videos, and a show on iplayer (uk tv catch-up streaming service for us ppl so it has regular tv shows on it like netflix pretty much). i can enable spatial audio, i hear it enable because of the brief pause, and i can hear the clear before and after, but if i go a step further and try to enable head tracking, nothing changes, it stays the same sa regular spatial audio. i have read many accounts of people using head tracking to watch youtube, tv shows, movies etc, and i've been through all the settings etc to check if i'm missing something, but everything seems right, it seems like it *should* just work.

can't find any clear answers on google beyond people saying they do use head tracking for these things. has anyone else mananged to use head tracking on iplayer? and as for youtube, is it only certain videos that support it? if anyone has any idea what the deal is, would appreciate your input!

i've only tried it with music but i'm eager to try it for video, movies etc, i was sure it would work on iplayer, being actual tv shows but yeah, still no luck... and i don't really see the point in regular spatial audio, it *kind of* enhances how it sounds  a bit..? i guess..? but i don't really get the same surround effect as with head tracking, even if i barely move my head, just inadvertent micro-movements seems to enrich the 3d effect so much.

&#x200b;

anyway yeah, hopefully can figure this out. thank you!"

"next s23u sale opportunity? i got the s23u during preorder and have been so impressed by it that a family member is also looking to make the switch. anyone have any historical insight as to when samsung may run comparable deals to the preorder (512gb for price of 256, etc.) once the phone is already out?"

"s-pen latency over time: have you noticed it? for curiosity sake, i wanted to know how much of an effect the latency of the s-pen actually has on usability and the perception of smoothness and ""instantness"". the current s-pen technology has a latency of the 2.8ms, as found on the s23 ultra, the s22 ultra, tab s8+ and tab s8 ultra. the previous latency values before that were 26ms, as found on the note 20, and 9ms, as found on the note 20 ultra and tab s7+. prior to that, it was significantly higher at 45ms on devices like the note 10. 

so, here's my question: users who've used either the note/s ultra series from at least the note 10 series to the s22 or s23 ultra, or the tab s6 to the tab s8 plus or ultra, have you noticed a difference in the latency reduction over time? is the reduction from 45ms to 26ms to 9ms and now 2.8ms actually noticable? or is it just a nice thing to have/marketing fluff for what was already fine? 

i'm not looking to gripe on samsung; i'm just curious about how much users actually notice the improvements when it's measured in thousandths of a second. 

thanks!"

"smart switch killing the battery interested if we could see how many people had issues with this and if we could ever see an official response 

i posted yesterday that i had some crap battery life and people were recommending i do a manual setup instead of smart switch and i don't know what sorcery it is but it seems to work

yesterday - 13h 26m used, 2h sot and 11 mins of gaming  - 54%

after resetting and manual setup with my same apps 

18h 56m, 1.5hr sot and 15 mins of gaming - 82%

both had almost no 5g either was at work or at home 95% of the time for both usages

i realise this is anecdotal but it does appear to have some  weight behind it"

"thinking of switching to s23 ultra (lifetime iphone user) hey guys and girls, you probably get so many of these posts but i thought i would post as i'm at a big crossroads for myself.

i'm a lifelong apple user, iphone 14 pro max, airpods pro/ max, airtags, apple watch ultra and the list goes on. but the problem is i'm just bored, it works, it all works seamlessly with little problems but at the same time with no excitement anymore, and as someone who loves tech and new features apple just isn't doing anything innovative for me.

i tried the s22 ultra when it came out last year along with the watch 4 classic and i did really like them but i was so far into the apple ecosystem that everything just felt odd and eventually i changed back. now the s23 range is out and my head won't let me go 5 mins without thinking about switching.

but if i'm truly honest with you l'm slightly afraid to do so. my entire family is apple and imessage is just so easy, i use facetime for weekly calls and airpods max are the only headphones l've found that both look good on me and actually sound good with best in class nc and transparency mode. also the apple watch ultra is something i couldn't live without, i hated apple watch before the ultra came out due to battery, but the battery life and water resistance as well as (in my opinion) best interface on a smart watch is just great for me.

even with all this though i still want to switch, from people with experience of just the s22/23 ultra or of both apple and samsung, could you give me some suggestions on how to make the transition easier or benefits of doing so. i know i could still use my airpods max but does anyone have any problems using them with android? same with the watch 5 pro. how does it compare to the ultra? i've watched countless videos on the matter but i always find that youtubers perspectives are a little biased and usually not as extensive as a full time user of the products.

again i know people probably see this a fair amount on the subreddit and feel free to tell me if this post isn't allowed but some actual user reviews and tips would be really helpful."

"finally, i got a samsung....again after some painful months with an iphone (when i say painful i really mean it) i managed to get a samsung galaxy s20 fe snapdragon, yes i know it isn't a new 2023 phone with bla bla bla and hundreds of megapixels but i just don't care about this camera and stuff, overall i just fell in love with it, sincerely one of the best phones i ever had, and i'm happy to have a samsung again. 

i hope no mean users start complaining about why i didn't spent thousands of dollars on a flagship phone that does bla bla bla, because for me it's just a phone, it just got to do what i need it to.


edit: for everyone asking what was my problem with the iphone:

i bought the iphone to try it out again after some long years of not having one, but the phone every time started to get really hot in a point that i had to use a fan to continue to use it, the battery lasted 3 hours even tho the phone was basically turned off the hole time, the phone started glitching right after i downloaded the ios 16, like the screen suddently started to have ghost touch, i even changed the screen but no success."

"a53 call volume deafening my a53 loves to deafen me. i'll answer the phone and the volume is low. i'll put it to my ear and the volume goes to max. every time. a normal call goes: call starts, i put it to my ear, pull it away, set the volume, and then resume the call. it's ridiculous, and i've not seen any options or even anyone discussing it. every discussion i've found is just, ""my call volume is too low"", ""it's suddenly quieter, blah blah"". i wish.

black line down the crease and no touch screen functionality after 5 months of ownership. way to go samsung :) i understand that there is a 1 year warranty but that shouldn't take away from the fact that this shouldn't be happening. i baby this phone and i haven't dropped it ever so who knows what caused it. do better samsung.
"transitioned from ios to android (s23ultra) i have not had android since 2010, which is when i transitioned to ios. yesterday, i decided to switch from iphone 12 pro max  to the s23 ultra, and i have 0 regrets. even though i am big on apple ecosystems in terms of products, i was also heavy in third-party apps like google to include google smart home products and others, so my transition was actually improved."

"watched a youtube video on samsung+dolby atmos, but dolby atmos made it sound worse if you got a samsung phone with dolby atmos mode and headphones handy, i suggest that you try it out: https://youtu.be/-cartvtysku

dolby atmos-mode takes away from the surround sound experience. the clarity is nice tho.

"galaxy s22 ultra - screen protector do you use a screen protector on your s22 ultra? if yes, which one?"
"while the s22u's battery sucks, i've been getting all-day battery life on battery-saver mode. it honestly sucks that i'm running a $1200+ smartphone on battery saver all the time but i've found this to be the only way to get a reliable full day's worth of battery life. as someone who uses their phone primarily for calls, social, and whatsapp i have no complaints with battery saver mode as i see no performance dips for my usage.

the phone is almost unusable for me on regular mode as it becomes the usian bolt of battery drain. i know it's a dead horse but samsung really dropped the ball with the sdg1 and i can't help but feel we all got a bit stiffed.

tl;dr - getting allday battery life on my s22u on battery saver, it's a dumpster fire without it."
"finally got my book 3 ultra! some performance notes. i put together my thoughts so far here since i did not see much about the performance and battery life online yet. the laptop has been pretty decent to use, i was looking for a laptop that can handle a decent bit of gaming but also has a good battery life and is portable, this seems to work so far.

## build quality / overall thoughts

personally, i feel the build quality is good. i noticed a bit of screen wobble and the screen is super reflective. having a numpad felt a bit weird in terms of positioning my hands. this is the first time i have thought that a trackpad can be ""too big"", i felt the keyboard was so far away sometimes, lol. the keys are also a bit shallow. but i did find myself getting used to these quirks over time.

## performance

i was a bit disappointed to hear the fans running loud when playing a game or when running benchmarks but the game performance was not even close to what i was expecting from a 4070 (even though it runs at such a low wattage). that was until i switched on the high performance mode in ""samsung settings"" app (it was already in high performance mode in windows battery settings), the performance was so much better after that! i only tested dota 2 so far, i went from \~55-60 fps to 100+ fps with max settings in native resolution. time spy scores: [https://imgur.com/a/iy7z7xb](https://imgur.com/a/iy7z7xb)

## battery life

i have been playing with the laptop just for a few hours now, so i do not have any solid numbers. i saw \~35% decrease in battery when using it for 2 hours at half screen brightness, on the quiet performance preset in samsung settings, adaptive refresh rate enabled, a second screen connected via superdisplay, have 15-20 chrome tabs open and playing videos constantly. i would estimate the battery life to be around 5.5 to 8 hours for medium to light use.

## pros, cons and final thoughts

* pros
   * display. can't think of a better looking display, oled looks so beautiful and 120 hz looks plenty smooth
   * form factor. pretty light for a (3.95lb/1.8kg) for a 16 inch laptop and pretty thin as well
   * performance. i would list this as a pro if i am not considering the price, the laptop is plenty capable, but a proper gaming laptop would have a way better performance (probably at the cost of battery life and/or good form factor)
* cons
   * price. the 'i9 processor' and 'rtx 4070' seems to be contributing more to the price than the performance imo.
   * keyboard. the lack of a good key travel, the number pad making the overall layout awkward, the weirdly positioned arrow keys do leave quite a bit of room for improvement in this area.
   * speakers. really? bottom facing speakers in 2023 on a $3k laptop? having such a nice display makes this even more painful for me personally. but overall not too bad.

the screen just might be what makes me keeps this laptop. let me know if you like to know something about the laptop or if there are things you want me to run on this laptop."
being charged for free watch offer just ordered the samsung s23 ultra through samsung's website and i noticed in being charged 669.99 for what's supposed to be a free offer for the watch and/or tablet.  i didn't even add either one of those to my cart.
"s23 (base), after 1st charge. getting 8 hours of screen on time. this phone is a breeze. even after some mild usage the phone rarely gets warm. i was thinking of getting a s22, but after seeing the processor issue decided to go for s23. think i made the correct decision. "
"how did my new samsung smart tv get my wifi password? i used my samsung android phone to do the setup for my new qn90b tv using smart things. my tv wound up with a working connection to my wifi and never asked me for the password. can any app on my phone tell someone else my wifi password, or is this a special feature samsung grants the smart things app?

i've got it using a direct hardwired connection now, but i had not yet plugged in the ethernet cable when doing the setup and am curious how it worked."
"samsung galaxy s23+ touch sensitivity. hey all.

i just got my samsung galaxy s23+ a couple of days ago coming from a oneplus 6t. i put a spigen glass screen protector on it the moment i took it out of the box before turning it on. this is the first samsung phone i've had since the galaxy s6.

and something is really killing the experience for me. the touch sensitivity. it feels so unresponsive. i find that swiping left and right feels slow and swiping up and down feels like it's dragging. the oneplus felt so fluid and smooth but this takes a lot of effort to scroll having to put much more pressure and drag further to make it move. even then sometimes it barely scrolls and sometimes misses my touch at all. it seems so inconsistent. and i've turned on the setting for increased sensitivity for screen protectors. 

is anyone else noticing this or just me? it feels awful and honestly i'm thinking of sending it back and getting a new oneplus. it just ruins the experience.

also the settings are a mess in comparison. so many things i've had to search the internet to find because of it and some things just seem not as good. the op has much more customization for a start. and a lot of things in oneui feels counter intuitive.

does anyone know if the notification tone and sms tone can be separate? if so i haven't found it. i prefer the app and sms tone to have separate sounds? does anyone know if it can be done? it's stupid if not. no custom accent colours either which is stupid, just basic ones. on op i could customise it at an rgb colour code level.

also does anyone know if the auto play for videos can be turned off for the gallery?

thank you all for reading and thank you in advance for comments and assistance. my main thing here that's driving me mad is the sensitivity and responsiveness.

edit: so to all the folks suggesting it's likely the screen protector, i removed it and tried using the phone without it. no noticeable difference. oneui just feels clunky compared to what i'm used to and the fingerprint scanner never recognises mine first time despite re-registering it. unless i press down harder than i'm used to and a good amount of pressure at that. i guess i'm quite unhappy with the samsung which feels overpriced for the experience."

"integrate wear os / tizen into routines and modes? as a type 1 diabetic, being able to use my smart devices to alert myself and family members that my levels are starting to go low (particularly at night) is great.

"psa: if your speakers are sounding crackled and/or distorted and rebooting isn't fixing it, open and close the sim card slot. was going crazy with my a52s because sometimes audio would just be completely screwed and within a few hours the problem would go away, but not immediately (so phone calls would be impossible unless i used headphones). went to samsung tech service about 5 times, no fix.

last visit was a miracle. tech told me this happens on several samsung smartphones including some s series when the atmospheric pressure inside the phone is different from the outside environment. just open the sim slot, let it equalize, and close it again. fixed.

just happened to me after a flight. sat down, did this and within 20 seconds it was perfect again."

"how could samsung improve the buds2 pro? i just recently got the buds2 pro after my buds pro case broke (way too early imo). they address every flaw i had with the buds pro. the slippery case is now grippy. the fit is amazing. i sometimes even forget that they are in. the sound is also amazing, as always. so what could they improve with the buds3 pro? slightly better noise canceling wouldn't be good enough for a whole new generation, and on the shape/case/responsiveness, they can't improve anymore. what do you think they are/could be working on?"
"s23u fingerprint scanner is horrible compared to my previous s20 fe i keep on having to scan multiple times for the fingerprint scanner to work. i never had this issue with the s20 fe. is the fingerprint scanner different or is the phone bigger than what my hand is used to?

edit: i think the s20 fe was more forgiving when you scanned your fingerprint diagonally. the s23u is still fast if you position your fingerprint perfectly, but it's a lot less forgiving if you don't. 

also, i haven't used any screen protectors. "
"any grippy case for s23u? i tried spigen's liquid air. it looks nice but very slippery. the pattern just ""looks"" grippy. does anyone have any recommendation? my hands are dry af so grippier the better."
"which brand cases would you recommend for the s23 ultra?! once i plan getting the samsung s23 ultra, i'm gonna get mine phantom black, i'm gonna put a screen protector on, & i'm definitely gonna put a really good case on it. cause the phone case that i have on my s21+ is old & has a couple holes in it & there's a piece on the bottom right side of it is just about ready to come off. so once i fully upgrade to the s23 ultra, what are some of the cases that you would recommend that would give it the best protection?!"
"is there an easy way to keep two phones up to date with texts? i want to switch back and forth between s23u and fold 4 and move the sim card but want to have all my texts on both phones no matter which one i grab.  especially since i might use the fold 4 much more so when i do grab the s23u i want to just grab and go and have the info and not wait for anything to dl.   i am on verizon.

"s23 ultra battery life question i remember hearing someone talking about the best way to keep the battery long lasting. something about do not let it die and keeping the battery between 15% and 85%.

is this accurate? if not what do you recommend?"
"is the s23 ultra seriously that much more scratch prone than past devices (like the s22u)? never have used a screen protector before. i've been using smartphones since the original g1 and i've never used a screen protector. no cracks from drops, and no unreasonable scratches other than the micro scratches accumulated from general use. i'm looking at my s9+ that i used for like 4 years with no protector and it looks fine to me still. little cuts here and there, nothing that i'd actually notice in general use.

now i'm hearing that the s23u is so incredibly scratch prone that a screen protector is mandatory? is it *really*? like i understand micro scratches, they happen over time and it's whatever, but people are making this sound like something new. like the scratchpocalypse.

i like cases, always use one, but screen protectors always struck me as a hassle, and i'm having a hard time finding one i can use with the case i've already ordered. whichever one i check it's either the thing bubbles a lot, doesn't work with cases, or ruins the fingerprint sensor (which i use a lot). i'd be willing to pay a lot for a perfect screen protector, but it doesn't seem to exist, so i'm rapidly leaning into skipping it altogether.

basically, i'm asking if just using this thing without a protector will eventually result in a nigh unusable screen, or if we're just talking about the sort of thing that would bother a person examining the screen from the right angle with some light and a microscope? is it noticeably worse than something like an s9+ or even the s22 ultra in terms of scratch resistance?"
"2023 over the horizon collection i was sad to see that the over the horizon songs have not been released for download or streaming officially. while there are youtube videos, these are compressed and some even have parts of the music cut off. so i decided to gather them all and share.

for the uninitiated, 'over the horizon' is the samsung galaxy theme song. the first version was released with the galaxy s2 in 2011. every year samsung refreshes the song and bundles it with their galaxy devices from that year.

these are sourced from the original files that are shipped with the devices. however, i have modified the file names and tags to correct some mistakes and keep everything consistent. the collection of songs, ringtones, and media previews can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1njdbpqm7nukoqf5epwkskjzjtl4fyxxi?usp=sharing).

note that i have converted non-mp3 files to mp3 so that all the files can be easily opened and used. also, for ringtones starting from the galaxy s22 and later, i have edited the tracks to remove the third channel that is used to sync the haptic motor feedback with the track. if you want the original files, they are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/xdd4g7/samsung_galaxy_audio_library_alarms_notifications/).

"samsung s23 ultra 8gb ram vs 12gb ram  

hi guys,

i want to buy a samsung s23 ultra but only the 8gb ram variant is in stock where i live. i don't really game on my phone, just scroll a lot of youtube and maybe some movies on plex, but have a lot of tabs opened in chrome (not sure if those take up a lot of ram, while they're not displayed).

so i don't think i'm an extreme power user.

the 256 gb storage seems more than enough for my needs, i have the same on my current phone and i've never had the need to clean the space even once in 4 years.

my question is this:

is 8 gb still okay to get as the 256 is exactly what i want, or should i wait for the 12gb ram variants to be back in stock?

is ram much more important in 2023?

&#x200b;

i don't mind to have only 2-3 apps in memory before they close, what i don't want, is for the phone not not be as snappy next year, because of the lack of ram.

thanks!"

"which of the cases offer raised edges higher than the curved screen to protect the s23 ultra? i only bought the spigen neo-hybrid case and it offers very minimal protection for the curved screen of the s23 ultra. then i bought the incipio duo case which i previously used for the s10+ but side of the case was significantly lower than the curved screen. i'm also not in the market for a bulky af case like otterbox or armadillotek just for the side protection of the case. 

so far in my amzn cart, i have the ghostek covert and the esr shock armor kickstand case. anyone who have these for their s23u, can confirm that the sides of the case are raised higher than the curved screen to give the phone a chance to survive a drop?"

"the truth (literally!) no one tells you about android vs ios updates i was not sure where to post this observation, but since i love samsung's version of android, i would like to leave it there for people who are interested.  


switcher here. i was an iphone user for more than 10 years but in 2022 i switched to samsung for a second time. partly because of being impressed by an old samsung phone from 2012. you will probably not believe but it still goes to internet, uses latest chrome version (or any browser of your choice) and even installs most apps from google play. and it is on kitkat 4.4. i mean, it is the same age as the iphone 5 that already cannot open any webpage on it's old ios 10 and install any app (maximum that could have been installed, original was ios 6 that is the same age as android 4)  


generally, one of the major reasons i switched was being tired of constant updates.   
often i see people on the web and on reddit particularly writing that ""no android manufacturer has such software support as apple"". as an ""apple veteran"" i have went through 13 major updates on different devices (ipad 1, ipad air 2, iphone 4, 5, 6s, 11 pro). and the way they serve the update didn't change throughout the years: apple literally downloads it to your device without your consent when you plug the phone on charger and wifi, then out of the blue (often when you are very busy and do not have time for that) they ask ""install update now or at night"", and you can only postpone it by clicking ""at night"". then you can delete it from storage but every time a newer version comes out ( for example 15.0.1, 16.1.3 etc) it will download again.  


most people will just hit ""install"" and it will download. it is a hit-or-miss, but usually every update is a slowdown comparing to the original version. users often face bugs with every single update. and there is no way back, you cannot revert to the original version if you don't like the one that you had installed.  


sure thing, updates bring security, better experience, blah blah blah and also bring users to the store in search of a new phone. it is a simple psychological trick everyone knows at apple, and considering how hard it is to get free of the ""ecosystem"", users usually rush to get a newer iphone.  


but what if you just do not update on iphone or ipad? first two years it is going to be ok. after that time sites usually start to lag and not open pages correctly, or the load time increases significantly. this is especially a problem of all banking apps due to them constantly updating all the site code. in the same time, this issue does not exist on android. yes, you get me right: ios update means everything. if you do not update, you are out. because all the browsers on ios are based on safari's webkit, so literally if you download chrome it will change nothing except the skin, sites won't open and there are gonna be even more slowdowns. after 3 years developers usually drop support for older ios versions and require newer ones. and 3 years literally means 3 major ios versions, thus people on ios13 cannot get most new apps and app versions on their devices unless they update or buy a new iphone if their ones does not support the update.  


in fact, you are in matrix and are provided with ""two pills"": have a slow but up-to-date iphone or have a fast but unsupported one.

on the other hand, on android you can install any modern app (and browser) even as it turns out, on 4.4 kitkat which is the similar age as the ios 5.1.1 that is installed on my mentioned above ipad 1.   


in fact, getting no update on android phone does not mean you will have problems with apps and services. it just means that you don't get newer os features and have a less secure phone. but if you know at least something in tech, does it even make sense? modern android is already dummy-proof enough not to allow the install from untrusted sources, as well as you won't probably get anything if you use up-to-date browser (which you do).  


in comparison, how does it feel to have constant updates on apple? you basically become a beta tester for anything apple wants to install on your phone. you have to deal with lags, bugs, slowdowns and incompatibility issues. and you cannot ""roll back to original app version"" like on android or just re-flash the original os unless you have shsh blobs (you surely won't have those at the moment you already updated). and in the end you have to buy a new phone because yours does not work as you wish it to. also you cannot just go and install old app ""apk"" (.ipa in ios) from web, because ""security"" and copyright, unless you saved the ones tied to your apple id on your pc or mac.  


i have lots of examples of how updates killed my idevices, but will tell you only the recent one. since 2014 i was effectively making music on my ipad. i had even bought official apple lightning to usb adapter to be able to connect my midi keyboard. after i installed the ios 15 update which i didn't want to do but had to (one of the apps stopped updating) the midi protocol stopped working, synth does not connect and garageband and similar apps freeze when it tries to connect and... nothing in the end. like, wtf. i was making music and suddenly cannot. and you know what is the worst? i cannot go back and this device is now called ""obsolete"", so it does not get any updates or patches except some security ones that do not fix such issues. now my only choice is to buy a newer ipad and hope the problem is fixed already, yet i am sure it is not and the device itself is not worth it.  


so next time you see anyone bragging that android has no updates, show them my post and see their reaction. because personally i would rather get no system updates than all these untested, poorly optimised and useless yearly updates like it is on apple devices.  


people who still have galaxy s3, s4, s5 and older than s10, i know you are here on this sub and i want to hear your voice! please, tell what is your experience in using the non-updated smartphones? is it a deal-breaker or something it is possible to live with?"
"pixel 7 to base s23? anyone make this switch? i've gone from nexus --> pixel 3, then tried samsung with the s20, s21, s22. s22 was a huge disappointment from battery standpoint and i've always been annoyed by the shutter lag and missed my pixel because of it. i got the pixel 7 and it's been mostly great, but i miss the size of the base galaxy phones, along with some of the extra features of oneui. i'm contemplating the s23 but really don't want the shutter lag again.

"how i got a factory unlocked s23 ultra for $306 first off, i always buy my phones outright, factory unlocked so they don't have specific carrier branding or carrier bloatware.  i then use them with a good reputable mvno for about half the monthly cost of a service plan from a major carrier with the only downside being slower speed when you're around thousands of other people like in a stadium.

the carriers entice people with shiny new objects with gazillion dollars off deals because (a) they know the majority of consumers can't afford to buy the phone outright and (b) they make the big discount a monthly credit spread over 24-36 months so unless you have 3 or 4 lines with the carrier, you will be paying out the nose for the service which is where they make their profit so they can afford to give you low payments on the phone.  try to leave before the 24-36 months and you have to give the phone back or pay it off and lose the remaining credits from the discount.

google fi and spectrum have the best deals. google fi is more straight forward though. $600 off the phone at purchase and you just have to stay with them 120 days (google fi is a t-mobile mvno and also uses us cellular towers when it makes sense.)  spectrum is convoluted about getting your money back (there's debate whether it's a service credit that they'll refund the unused portion of if you leave them after 60 days or a visa cash card 2 months later or whatever. and you'll get a spectrum branded phone.

at samsung store, the pre-order deal cost with trading in my note 20 ultra was $807 including a $46 additional educational discount which pretty much anyone can get. pass. (almost forgot, they also threw in for note 20 trades a free watch that you could net about $125 for on ebay, so technically net would have been around $680.)

google fi, the phone was an instant $600 off or $599 ($649 with tax) 512gb model.  the monthly plan is, with a coupon for a $20 credit, a total of $60 more over the minimum 4 months than the comparable us mobile plan i use.  so that's a total cost of $709.  the big catch is my note 20 ultra is mint condition. sold it for $483.33 on ebay.  net after ebay fees and shipping cost is $403.  so the net cost on upgrading to the s23 ultra is $306.  and the best thing is i'm not stuck with a specific carrier branded phone (so it will have better resale value) and don't have to pay for a $40-$70 overpriced plan at verizon, t-mobile, or at&t for 2-3 years (i use no more than 10gb a month so a $20 15gb plan for a verizon mvno suits me great. coverage is the same, speeds always adequate(even \*real\* high-speed 5g supported not basically relabeled 4g lte speed all the time) and great customer service.)"
"galaxy s10+ vs a52s 5g in 2023  hey guys

i own a xiaomi redmi note 9 pro since 2020. this phone was great in performance and especially battery life, but unfortunately i've been having really bad ghost touch issues with it since 1.5 years ago with other issues as well. with that said i'm trying to avoid xiaomi entirely.

i kept looking for a another midrange phone. galaxy a73 was too expensive where i live (510$), and i heard about performance issues about the a53 so it didn't really convince me.

i decided in the end to pick the a52s 5g, only to be given a used galaxy s10+ (exynos) as a gift recently. i like the s10+'s screen and build material and also it's quite fast. but i tested its battery capacity with accubattery and it gave me 85% (3500 mah) so i'm having doubts about its longevity.

i'm currently deciding whether i should stick with the galaxy s10+ (exynos) ? or sell it and buy the a52s 5g ? i don't really care about updates unless they actually correct big issues with the os, and i mainly use my phone to watch youtube, take notes and take calls. and i could really use a good battery life like the note 9 pro's and a bright screen outdoors especially when i'm traveling.

what do you guys think is the best decision ?"

"first time having a bad trade-in experience with samsung i pre-ordered the s23 ultra putting my s22 ultra up for trade-in. the s22 ultra only has minor cosmetic damage. the reason for the trade-in is my battery is terrible for some reason; it doesn't last a work day. 

i got the s23 ultra and sent in my s22 u. about a week later, i receive an email from samsung that the s22 u was ineligible for full credit because the body or screen was cracked. knowing the device was in very good condition when i sent it to them, i opted to have them return it instead of accepting $150 or so in credit for the device. 

after i chose to have it returned, i called samsung's customer service to find out if there would be any options available to me if the phone does come back to me cracked or otherwise damaged and all i had for proof was my story vs theirs. the customer rep was super helpful. apparently they make video recordings for their ""triage reports"" (or something) so he was able to find video evidence that my phone was not damaged. that was a relief. he offered me a $50 code to be emailed to me for all the trouble; the email never arrived. 

a few days later, i receive my s22 u and it's in the same condition i sent it out. except! samsung took my s pen. i am sorry i did not make any video recordings of the device i was going to trade in. i had grown confident in the samsung trade-in process as i've been trading in my old devices yearly since the note8. i will call them again to see if they'll do anything about this.

"fraudulent and no responsibility taken. beyond disappointed and shocked. hi people,

i've posted this on samsung forums but just wanted to share my experience here.

so i've been buying from samsung since the s4 line years and years ago. however, this is the first time i purchased from the official site. i bought the s23 during pre-order and used the trade-in program, but what happened over 2-3 weeks has completely made me lose faith and trust in samsung. i will never buy a phone from them again.

i ordered the s23 ultra 512gb in cream with some phone accessories from the e-voucher.¬†**au230202-38617344** was¬†my order number and i was stoked to see what samsung had to offer. when i received it, turns out the side of the phone became a little scuffed and i asked for an exchange. the agent was kind enough and assured me the replacement process has been arranged. all i had to do is wait for the return label to be emailed and send it in.¬†

now i don't know why a return label took almost a week to be sent, but it did on an afternoon and i sent it in as swiftly as i could. both the s23 ultra and the a52s was mailed off, and i kept the tracking numbers.

the week after on a wednesday, i got an email saying the refund has been completed. ??? i realized there must've been a mistake somewhere and contacted samsung's live chat pronto. i asked for a replacement, not a refund, and the agent before also reassured me. the agent this time investigated the situation and acknowledged that they can see the refund request was clear, but their back offices marked it as 'lost in transit' and subsequently refunded me for it. keep in mind both the phones showed up as 'delivered' on my auspost tracking.¬†

i have asked multiple times for assistance, over live chat and live call, but none of the representatives had the authority to actually do anything about it, since the order is now ""complete"". they sent my case over to their 'voc', whatever that is, and a week later today there is still no contact.¬†

i'm just beyond distressed and disappointed at this moment. i've lost 2 phones, 2-3 weeks of my time, and work opportunities. such a big company and they had nothing to offer - no direct contact with their higher-ups, no ramification, and no adequate processes and quality checks in place to prevent incidents like this. i'd buy it again but, i am not paying $2,2k\~ to cover their mistakes and negligence when i paid $1569 rightfully during the pre-order. samsung couldn't even offer me a voucher code to let me buy it again.

i don't even have a phone to use now, and it's thanks to me believing in samsung in the first place. again, i just have no words for samsung's appalling processes and their negligence to customers. i don't want to ever buy from samsung again, and this is just the experience i wanted to share.

so has anyone actually experienced subpar customer service and order negligence like this?? i'd be keen to hear people's thoughts. i'm also planning to buy the iphone 15 ultra. seriously screw samsung. they also need to give me my crappy a52s back.

thanks.

i received a call today, 3rd of feb at 12:22pm. i assume it was from one of the many follow ups the samsung reps raised for me. the agents messed it up again.

"just switched from a iphone 13 pro to the new s23 ultra and i love it i'm writing this, to maybe help some people who are sitting on the fence of switching from an ios device to an android device.

i was an apple user since the iphone 4, which was a great time and a lot of innovation on apple's part. however, since the iphone xr and ios 12, it felt the same for me every year. 1.5 years ago, i was pulled into buying a new 13 pro, but i wasn't just excited anymore. i wanted something new. first i tried the z flip 4, but returned it because of the narrow screen (it's so narrow!). 

when i saw that the s23 ultra came out, i was really tempted. i bought the new phone and gifted my 13 pro to my girlfriend who doesn't really care about phones at all, lol. 

i'm using it now for a couple of days and i can say i'm in love. the notification system was weird for me in the beginning, but now i wonder how i could ever like the notification system on ios. it's so fast and intuitive, you can directly answer in the notifications, you can scroll in widgets. i love watching movies on youtube and netflix. i can customize stuff how i want. it has great night shots, that i took last weekend are way better than on iphone (to me at least, everyone has different taste). 

i can really recommend this phone as a good entry to android!"
"astro mode has some loose ends so i've been using the astro mode the last couple days and it is awesome, but of course, some things could be improved (or maybe i'm using it wrong?;


-s-pen shutter in expert raw. i know using a 2sec timer works too, but it's not the same.

-screen preview i think it's called in real cameras. 
where if you're busy focusing, the screen will completely zoom in on a tiny part of your live screen preview so you can check the focus.

usually things are very dark in your preview while astro shooting, so it helps being able to pick a random star and use that to focus on. 
because of the lens switching i assume it's a fruitless effort to actually zoom in and focus. and then zoom back out. 

focus peaking is nice but i'd rather preview it myself. moon shots already prompt this same sort of preview when stabilising at 100x (in the camera app, not expert raw).


-the constellation overlay is cool but every time i've used it, it was off a fair bit. and when i saw some galaxy i could potentially zoom in on (i know) like m44 or something.. that's when i remember finding it while zooming in is going to be hell.


-the 4/7/10 min exposure feature may be broken. not sure what happens but instead of one 7min exposure, tonight i notificed it gave me two 3,5min exposures. so 2 raw files and 2 jpegs. i do remember it's not the first time i've heard this.

also took a 10min exposure and as far as exif data goes, that shot doesn't exist. 

could all be due to built-in overexposure protection or something like it, but maybe it's actually buggy.

seoul‚Äîconsumers around the world are increasingly choosing  apple inc.‚Äôs iphones over high-end android smartphones, with younger users seen as pushing the company toward the level of dominance in the market globally that it has enjoyed in the u.s.

from europe to asia, apple‚Äôs market lead in the premium bracket  is growing, and polls show that people in their teens and early 20s,  known as gen z, increasingly see the iphone as a must-have. converts say  they are drawn by its design, cameras and airdrop features for sharing  photos.

the trend is putting apple‚Äôs chief rival, samsung electronics co., under pressure and threatening the south korean  company‚Äôs lead in the overall global smartphone market. samsung has been  promoting its splashy foldable phones and 100x zoom cameras on the latest galaxy s23 ultra that brought a ‚Äúwow‚Äù from elon musk on twitter.

in samsung‚Äôs backyard, where the brand‚Äôs android smartphones have held sway, apple‚Äôs clout has been growing since the company opened its first store in south korea  in 2018. apple now has four stores in the country, where its  mobile-payment system apple pay will soon become available for the first  time.

around 52% of people age 18 to 29 in south korea were using an  apple smartphone as of 2022, up from 44% two years earlier, according to  polls by gallup korea. samsung‚Äôs share of this age group slipped to 44%  from 45% in that time, the polls showed. for all older age groups,  samsung phones remain most prevalent.

chung kyung-rim, a 22-year-old college student in seoul, said nearly  all of her peers use an iphone. apple‚Äôs reputation for prettier designs  and good photos has stuck through the years, she said, though she thinks  samsung‚Äôs devices have improved in looks and likes the diverse colors of samsung‚Äôs latest flip phones, she said.

apple‚Äôs rise among young people will likely help the u.s.  firm‚Äôs position in the high-end phone business that it has been leading.  apple‚Äôs share of worldwide shipments of smartphones priced at $800 and  above grew to 76% last year from 65% in 2018, while samsung‚Äôs declined  to 17% from 27%, according to canalys, a tech-market researcher. china  has been one major driver of growth for apple after u.s. sanctions crippled another rival, huawei technologies co.

samsung remains the world‚Äôs largest smartphone maker by overall  shipments, a title it has held since 2012. even here, apple is closing  in on its rival. samsung‚Äôs market share has held roughly steady at  around 21% for the past five years, according to canalys, while apple‚Äôs  share climbed to 19% in 2022 from 15% in 2018.

high-end smartphones are critical for phone makers as they  bring in the biggest profits and showcase technological capabilities and  leadership, said tom kang, a seoul-based director at counterpoint  research.

the pricier phone segment also represents a pocket of resilience in  an industry that has been sliding. last year, global shipments of  smartphones priced above $800 grew 1%, while overall shipments of  smartphones fell 12%, according to canalys.

a samsung spokesman noted that preorder volumes for the recently launched galaxy s23 smartphone series were higher than for the prior year‚Äôs models, with 60% of consumers choosing the most-expensive galaxy s23 ultra.

apple didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.

in the u.s., where apple accounted for 77% of the  premium-smartphone market last year according to canalys, one reason for  the popularity of iphones among young people has been the prevalence of  imessage, apple‚Äôs messaging app that is widely used and designates different colors for iphone users and android users.

elsewhere in the world that is seen as less of an edge because third-party mobile messengers are more mainstream, from whatsapp in europe to kakaotalk in south korea.

young people around the world say they are attracted by  apple-exclusive features such as airdrop, which enables easy sharing  between iphones between friends, and preferences for apple‚Äôs photography  and design.

for years, apple‚Äôs marketing has focused on taking cinematic photos and videos.

today‚Äôs top-end iphone and samsung galaxy smartphone both have  similar camera components and excel at capturing quality high-resolution  photos, said choi kab-soo, a travel photographer living in seoul who  runs smartphone-photography classes.

some differences in the color expression of the photos might  make people feel that apple‚Äôs phones take better photos in everyday  settings, said mr. choi, who uses an iphone.

sarah carrivale, a 24-year-old graduate student living in  paris, has noticed that more people around her age are using  iphones‚Äîaround 7 in 10 she estimates.

she switched to an iphone 12 two years ago, after using a  string of android devices including ones from samsung and a chinese  brand. after taking a while to get used to the iphone, she said she is  satisfied with its durability, ease of navigation and cameras.

‚Äúonce you get an iphone, in a way there‚Äôs no turning back,‚Äù ms. carrivale said.

across western europe, android users under the age of 25 were  almost three times more likely to prefer apple for their next smartphone  than older age groups, according to a poll last year by canalys of  4,000 individuals from the u.k., germany, spain and italy. apple users  under 25 were more than twice as likely as android users of the same age  to stick with their respective operating systems, the poll showed.

apps on an iphone feel faster and more glitch-free, even if the  specs are similar to an android device, said nicholas leonzi, a  26-year-old retail worker in london. he tried out a samsung galaxy s21  ultra in 2021, which had ‚Äúcool‚Äù features  like charging his galaxy buds pro earphones on the back of the phone. a  regular phone upgrader, he reverted back to apple after a year and is using the latest version of the airpods pro.

apple has also grown by building its products based on the same  operating system, helping strengthen user retention and brand loyalty.  android smartphones have far more players in the mix because it isn‚Äôt a  closed operating system like apple‚Äôs.

‚Äúas younger consumers grow stickier to the apple ecosystem, it‚Äôll become harder for samsung to compete with apple,‚Äù said                       nicole peng,          a canalys senior vice president.

samsung, which leads the android segment, is working to catch up  by focusing efforts on making its products from smartphones to tvs to  appliances, and those of partner brands, work together in the most  hassle-free manner possible.

one bright spot for samsung is that it is leading the foldable-smartphones category  it helped pioneer. sales of foldable phones represent less than 1% of  the smartphones shipped worldwide today, but their increased popularity  could boost samsung‚Äôs future position in the premium category, analysts  say. apple has yet to announce any plans for foldable phones.

lee hye-jin, whose high-school-age daughter and son have owned  iphones since middle school in seoul, highlighted the iphone‚Äôs appeal to  younger generations. she estimated that 7 out of 10 of her children‚Äôs  classmates are iphone users.

‚Äúthey say it‚Äôs more ‚Äòhip‚Äô to use apple,‚Äù she said."
"calling all routine users: is there any way to have phone charge if battery is below a certain % only, and not stop until it hits the protect battery (85%)  

i hate that protect battery puts the phone back on charge as soon as it drops to 84% after reaching 85%, the defined protect battery threshold.

got a routine set up for the daytime to enable battery protect if placed on a charger during certain hours (11am - 3am). i'll never need 100% charge after a certain time, so getting to 85% is fine after 11am.

what i'm trying to do now is set up 2 routines.

**routine 1** is simple: enable protect battery during certain hours (11am - 3am).

routine 2 - i don't think i can do it, but maybe i'm missing something obvious? i've written how i want it to work:

**routine 2 - check if phone battery is low enough to charge**

* if phone placed on a wireless charger, check battery level  

   * if battery level above / = x (say 65%), then  

      * don't charge
   * if battery level below x (say 65%)  

      * charge (phone will charge to 85% due to protect battery = true)
   * if battery level ***drops*** below x  

      * charge (phone will charge to 85% due to protect battery = true)

the idea - when wireless charging: to have the phone not charge to 85%, stop, fall to 84%, start charging to 85%.... repeat cycle...

instead, i'd like to charge to 85%, then not have the phone charge again until it falls below 65%. it sounds super simple so i'm convinced i'm just being stupid."

"has the new z flip model fixed the issues the first two models had? hey everyone, 

&#x200b;

basically, it's the title. i'm closing in on a upgrade for my current phone (it's currently the s21 5g model) and i'm going to be sticking with samsung going forward. nothing but positives about my current phone with the only issue being the charging port currently is very buggy. as in, only charges at certain angles and sometimes it just disconnects the charger (i believe it might just be the charging port not holding the charger cable in right is all, but easy to get around).

&#x200b;

i was looking at the z flip 4 due to the size when shut is a big positive, my current job means having a large phone in my pocket will increase the chances of accidental presses and damage to the screen, my current screen protector that has been fantastic from getting the phone nearly 2 years ago, (i got a fantastic deal on the newest release due to how long the account has been on the provider).

&#x200b;

i've watched some youtube videos, but the issue i've found is a lot of the big 'techtubers' tend to focus fully on the positives, be it personal preference or if they don't want to upset samsung i don't know, but i know the original model and the z flip 2 had several issues which i thought i'd ask before going for the plunge.

&#x200b;

have they sorted out the issue the hinge had with it failing fast in daily use?

has the battery life been improved? i work 12 hour shifts and while i'm not on my phone the entire 12 hours, i saw several people complaining even in rest mode the battery drained fast.

how is the front screen in terms of usefulness? it's not one that needs any sort of squinting to see in darker lights is it?

how is the build quality on it? samsung phones in my experience have been really well built and can take a bit of a beating, not saying i'm going to be throwing the phone at the wall, but there will be times a box may hit it, will it hold up with a case?

&#x200b;

i won't be upgrading until april so i also don't know if they are going to be releasing a z flip 5 soon, which is another question actually.

&#x200b;

any advice/help would be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading through my wall of text."
"s23 ultra terrible battery! i have had my s23 ultra for a few weeks now and the battery life is absolutely nothing short of abysmal. i can only get a maximum of 4hrs of sot, which is ridiculous for this flagship given the price i paid and that others are getting 8-9-10hrs sot. it drains 1% for like every few minutes of usage.

i previously used smart switch to transfer from my s21+ and after reading that it can potentially cause battery drain i factory reset the phone. nothing changed. here are my settings:

- 120hz wqhd+
- mix of wifi 6 and lte 4g (no 5g, good signal in my area)
- brightness around 40%
- bluetooth on (galaxy watch 4)
- protect battery (only charge to 85%)

i have a bixby routine set up to turn off wifi, mobile data, bluetooth and turn on airplane mode and battery saver, yet it still drains like 4-5% overnight. i can't imagine how much it will drain without that... i am 100% confident i have no rogue apps draining my battery.

coming from an s21+ (was getting 2h sot, the only reason i upgraded was the battery life...) this feels like i got scammed by samsung yet again. do i have the shittiest luck in the universe or is samsung fundamentally bad? 

i apologize for the long rant and i'd really like some insight here because i am understandably pissed off when others are getting such crazy battery life.

"i still don't get why samsung used a 200mp sensor on their s23u when they could have just improved their 105mp sensor and shuttle speed on the s23u. even with 200mp, their camera quality is still not the best overall in the market."

"s23 ultra case options i havent been in the market for a case in a long time, but after ordering the s23 ultra, i think i need to change that. ive done a lot of research, but im looking for slightly different input than what other people have asked for. mind you, i dont drop my phone often or ever, its more of a security than a need.

the side question i have is magsafe. is it worth it? i havent looked into it before but i see quite a few cases with it, or the halo from esr. any experience? normally i just have a metal plate between my phone and case, but the change might be welcome, even after buying a bunch of accessories to make it worth my time. any experience on that specifically is very welcome.

i see a lot of clear cases available, but im afraid of them being gross or nasty after a while of use, with yellowing color, scratches, and dust and grime getting in and being clearly visible.. has anyone had similar problems? should this not be an active concern?

i would love a ""do all case"" but at the same time i dont want or need a tank - im more interested just because having the ""full enclosure"" is an interesting concept for the outdoors or in general.

last option im interested in is protective, but slim. ive had pitaka and loved it, mous and loved it, but looking for other options as well.

any advice is welcome, just trying to raise some of my own opinions and gain some knowledge!"
"[serious] notification icons need to be different colors there was recently an update that went out that changed all of the notifications on my phone to be the same color.

for example, these are the old notifications: [here](https://i.imgur.com/potnlb9.jpg).

and these are the [new ones](https://i.imgur.com/ke4fdw0.jpg)

before, it was easy to scan down the list as a whole, pausing my eyes only on the color of the text. familiarity of what's usually in that list (lets face it, we don't always clear *all* of our notifications) contrasts nicely with what's new to the list, especially when there are so many items i need to scroll down to see all of them. i'm able to memorize its contents with less effort. it was much easier to use. 

on the new color scheme, my old habits of scanning are obsolete. i'm having a difficult time. i've been trying to scan down the left side only to see what app it is, then i read the notification itself. it's a lot to take in. the only way to tell apps apart is a basic shape inside that purple bubble and my vision isn't what it used to be on these high density phone displays.  

i really don't like the change. you probably could have guessed that by now. if this was an a-b test, please dial me down. if this is the new default setting, please reconsider. if there's an easy way to get the colored title text back, even better. but i will still be peaved that it just changed to this without my consent. i still use old reddit for goodness sake.

if you're looking for a better solution, may i suggest slightly tinting the notification bars themself with the app default color. nothing wrong with a little more variation of color in our lives. you can keep it subtle yet maintained the readability. 

tldr: my phone is harder to use because of the new ui design"
"is it worth switching from an iphone 11 pro max to a folding phone? hey, so i‚Äôve had an iphone 11 pro max for a while now, and i‚Äôve decided i want to change. is it worth getting a foldable phone? i‚Äôve heard stories about how they can break easily, so that‚Äôs my first worry. my second worry is about any dust getting in the phone and messing up the hinges. also, how visible is the crease, and how does the display feel compared to a traditional glass display? would it be worth me buying one off a second hand website like back market, to save a bit of money, or should i just go with new?"
"i made a mistake switching to iphone. the ui design just isn‚Äôt as good. i need the navigation bar. it‚Äôs so annoying having to manually close my tabs. i can‚Äôt double tap to switch to my last app. it‚Äôs some weirdly specific swipe from the bottom of the screen, and if you get it wrong, it just brings you to the home screen. i can‚Äôt just flick the screen to open the unlock screen, again you have to drag it up right from the bottom - i have small hands! 

i wish there was a way to customize this phone and get a similar navigation bar üòî"

"samsung's order processes are so bad they're an active cyber security risk to their customers this morning i received an sms from a cell phone number i'd never seen before telling me my requested samsung delivery date wasn't available and to click a link to rebook.

now i have ordered from samsung and am waiting for a product however, i get tons of delivery notification scams and am wise enough to initiate a chat with support.

where i'm told not only can they not verify for me that they sent a message but that if i want to set a new requested date i'd need to click the link in the sms provided.

given the prominence of phishing scams and cyber crime in 2023 this is totally unacceptable.there's nothing in the message that can be used to verify it's legit and support can't or wont confirm that samsung sent it and it's legit while telling me the only way to actually get confirmation and book a new date would be to click a link that can't be verified as trusted.**this is a terrifying level of disregard for customer safety.**

so i ask to have my concerns raised in a case and have an email sent to me with some level of follow up at a minimum i'd like to know im actually going to receive the product im paying thousands of dollars for.

this is not an option, samsungs processes mean that sending me an email to be followed up can't be done.

i own probably somewhere in the ball park of $10,000 worth of samsung goods and am stunned by the utter indifference to customers digital safety as well as complete in ability to provide clear information on an order.to the extent that i'm no longer going to by future samsung products and will likely end up cancelling this order ... assuming i ever get a support agent that can help me.  


edit  
tl;dr  


samsung need to seriously address their behavior and do a far better job of communicating clearly when their customers need to take action to ensure an order is delivered.  


their current approach is so bad it can only serve to encourage customers to disregard sensible safety practices and place themselves at risk to ensure orders get delivered."
"dear samsung - why are your tv remotes so horrible? just picked up another samsung tv, a nice 85 inch one. the picture is great, but the controls, and particularly the remote, are just terrible. on my last new samsung tv, i begrudgingly got used to not having a button to access the picture menu. this new remote is on a whole nother level of stupid. there are 4 streaming app buttons, and there is even a split screen button, but there isn't a source button? what moron at samsung thought it was a good idea to prioritize having a prime video button but not a source button? at least it has solar charging now because it was so hard replacing the battery every two years or so. next thing you know and we'll have to use the menu to change the volume. i wish there was a way to reprogram the buttons on the remote. one thing i did discover was that the source button on the older style remotes can actually change the source on my new tv."

"some grievances switching from pixel 7 pro to the s23 ultra first off, i do like the overall experience - especially from the hardware side. the phone just feels way more premium. (as it should considering the price difference)

-

**still there are a few minor things that annoy me:**

* volume buttons - this actually surprised me because when i first got the pixel i thought the placement was weird but over time it grew on me, it feels more natural now

**oneui:**

* folders - they just feel more thought through on the pixel, you can open and select the app you want with one hand instead with oneui you must either shift the phone or use both hands (there is a setting in homeup on goodlock but the folder opening animation takes forever so it‚Äôs not usable in my opinion)
* app drawer - there is no option to focus the search bar automatically
* app drawer - no *real* app list (there is a setting on homeup but then you have ""priority apps"" pinned on top which makes the whole thing unusable)
* quick panel - the settings and power icons being at the bottom on the pixel makes quickly accessing them so much more convenient


-
looking at the list - most of the ""issues"" could be solved by switching to a different launcher but for such an expensive phone i expect them to do better"
"the switch i started with the iphone 7 plus until the xs max and then i swichted to the s22 for a change. i fell in love with the design of the phone, which made me switch to samsung.

now i can't wait on the realease of the s23. i am gonna go with the plus maybe. 

i still use a macbook and i admit that the ecosystem of apple works great. but the design is always the same and boring. one of the reasons i switched to samsung is because of the round watch, i don't like the square watches.

anyone else made a switch from apple tot samsung without any regret?"

"modular phone cases? hey r/samsung! 

i'm currently awaiting my new s23 ultra, and one of the most exciting parts of the phone shopping process was my plan to get a peak design case for my next phone. i knew i'd be switching, but it wasn't worth the startup cost for my current popsocket attachments until i was already buying a new phone anyway. 

as it turns out, the magnetic attachment system for peakdesign will disable the most exciting feature of the new phone, that being the stylus. does anyone know of any other relatively slim and sleek cases that have a full modular system of accessories? the ones that sound most interesting to me are: 

\-wallet

\-something to attach a pop socket to

\-additional battery

\-additional storage

\-additional ports, such as usb-c, ethernet, or hdmi

\-items like rangefinders

i have been looking around both business and personal solutions providers for a case that may work, but all that i have found have turned out to either rely on magnets, rendering the stylus useless, or not having an option for popsocket/wallet/popwallet (which i currently use), and not having a popsocket or wallet option at all is unfortunately a dealbreaker. 

really, if i could get a peak design case with no magnets but with access to all of the peak design accessories, i'd be happiest. does anyone know of other good phone case systems with some modularity?"

"psa: turn off ram plus...your battery life and performance will thank you basically the title. the idea of ram plus is great but in practice it works terribly and it will hurt your battery life along with hurting the performance in the meantime. after i got my s23u it was literally the first thing i turned off and multiple people who have also gotten them have been helped in their battery life considerably since i recommended they do this also.

edit: not saying this is going to be universally true for everyone obviously as everyone's needs and demands are different. my personal experiences (and no, i don't take pictures of all stats before and after i make settings changes to my devices) with previous models have shown improvements in performance and battery by both being able to turn it off if it's an option (added in one ui 5.0) or tuning it down to lower gb amounts. because of those previous experiences it was something i turned off first getting my new devices and friends of mine have had similar improvements especially in battery after i recommended they turn it off.

i understand a lot of this is anecdotal and you can discount it if you so feel inclined but i know my end user experience has been greatly improved by choosing to bypass this feature and i thought it was worth putting out there for others."

finally tried it this morning and it works great with an hdmi cable connection, but wireless is still an issue (at least using screen mirroring on a fire cube).

2. the lack of bluetooth codecs. pretty annoying to me, as my kz aptx-hd cable will put out aptx at best with the s23 ultra i want to buy soon..

i really just want to see if maybe, someone from samsung checks these forums and sees the criticism. i bought my cable specifically for aptx hd, now i can't use it anymore, it just sucks for me. maybe we can get a little thread started here, with more negatives but also positives! the s-pen as an example is really nice, but the ram limitation for the base model is questionable."
"the s23 is insane for game emulation! console level graphics naruto storm 4 running at 30fps i am so glad i bought this phone (s23 base 256gb) even with the camera lag issue because it can do one thing iphone and pixel phones cannot, and that is switch emulation. 

switch emulation (3ds and psp also) is insane on the s23, the snapdragon 8 gen 2 and it's gpu has really impressive performance 

here are 2 gameplay videos i recorded. i just played the game for 20+ minutes while screen recording so towards the end there is thermal throttling with more than 3 characters on the screen. throughout the 32 minutes of play time it used 5.8% battery.

i was so into the game the 2nd time i accidentally clicked stop and it didn't record but that was the best performance i got too since it was 30 frames the whole time without recording. 

first video i had the wrong audio setting so there is only bgm
https://youtu.be/wx8jdb0723c

second video has it all but is after 15 minutes of playing and recording.
https://youtu.be/9gyr0tyq0la


there are 2 apps that you can choose to use for emulation: 

- eggns (paid - need a supporting controller or monthly sub)

- skyline (free)

- skyline edge (patreon sub)

skyline edge is much more respectable since they built from the ground up using open source code and have been steadily improving game performance at a fast rate. they will at some point i hope overtake eggns.

eggns has more support and better frames on most games but that is because they have been around for longer, they began by taking code and profiting off it so they have a bad reputation. 

personally whatever runs the games better in the end is what i'm going to be using. the eggns developers have hinted at an ios release but i'm doubtful it will run well since there are so many restrictions on ios.

you will then need to follow guides to source your own key files, firmware and game roms. 

other games i tried on eggns: 

- astral chain 30 fps, it's pretty good but haven't gotten to intense combat yet

- mario kart 8 deluxe starts at 60 fps but it drops to 40 fps

- super mario bros u deluxe 60 fps whole time

- pokemon brilliant diamond and violet had issues maybe it needs a driver update cause others can run it

- metroid prime remastered 60 fps

so yeah pretty excited to be carrying my s23 and able to play console level games offline for about 1 hour. and still have amazing battery for the rest of the day as well."

1.  in the default setup the pull down quick panel does not show the brightness setting option until you pull the panel down a second time.  if you want it to show display brightness the first time, pull the panel down a second time, then hit the three dots at the top right, then hit quick panel layout, then hit brightness control, always show.
2. samsung reverses the navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen from standard android.  to reverse them back to go settings, search for navigation bar, hit navigation bar, look for button order."
"anyone having issues with their s23 refusing to wireless charge? my wife got her new s23 2 weeks ago and is having problems with wireless charging. every so often it just stops working. you put it onto a wireless charger and nothing happens, no messages, no acknowledgement that it's even trying to charge. once this happens, the only way to fix it is a reboot. once you reboot, it starts wireless charging as normal.

it doesn't stop charging part way through, if you put the phone on the charger it either starts working or nothing!. if it starts charging, it will charge ok until full. so it's not a temperature issue.

we have tried 4 different wireless chargers (a samsung one, two from amazon and an in-car one). they all work fine until the phone decides to stop recognising the chargers and then none work.

we have even tried  wireless power sharing from my s23 ultra - nothing until a reboot.

if we plug in a charging cable, it will start charging ok, but still won't wireless charge.

it can happen at any battery level, we've seen it at 46%, 65%, 85% and 96%.

my s23 ultra uses the same wireless chargers without issue. we still have my wife's s21 and that has never had issues with the same chargers. so i am 100% sure it's not a charger issue.

we are wondering if it's a hardware of software issue. if it's hardware we need to get the phone returned and replaced, if it's a software issue then we can perhaps wait for samsung to fix it.

anyone else and similar experience?

thanks."

i guess what i'm wondering is, is the s23 a big enough leap forward, or is it worth holding out for the s24 if i think i can make it another year with my s10? 

i'm not in tune with the smartphone world, so i have no idea what the current speculations are in terms of new tech coming next year."

s21 still a good phone? my mom is wanting to get my younger sister a new phone. she has the a12 now and it's junk. samsung has the s21 refurbished with warranty for right under $500 with trade in of an old a11 we have. is this still a good deal? seems kinda high but it comes with warranty and is pretty much considered new since it's refurbished. thanks for any suggestions.

"s23+ battery life is seriously amazing made the switch from an iphone 13 pro which required me to charge mid day or phone was pretty much dead by the end of day. i consider myself a power user with the exception of games and my habits have not changed since making the switch to the s23+. i left the house at 90% did a 9 hour shift and ended the day with 75%. if anyone is looking to pick up this phone and battery life was a factor, look no further. shit is bonkers"
"s23 ultra charger brick suggestion im getting a solid 1day 10hours of battery life with my s23ultra. so i'm not much concerned about the charging speeds as such. 
i have 15 watt charger that came with my s10 so ive been using the same. 
0-100% takes aroung 1hr 50 mins. with 15 watts charger.

so im confused if i should get a 25watt or 45watt charger. how much time it'll save? and battery degradation caused by this fast charging if any? 

i'm more inclined towards getting samsung chargers only, and not anker ones."

why samsung does not have a so good health app such as apple? the title says it all.
"nightly charging without letting the phone sit at 100% using modes & routines modes and routines, formerly bixby routines ^(why did they change the name?!) allows your phone to limit itself at a maximum charge of 85% based on conditions. this action is called 'protect battery'.  

you can set up a conditiion between, say, 23:00 and 05:00, with protect battery on, and then at 05:00 it turns off automatically, and your phone continues towards 100%. so even without an explicit 'adaptive charging' feature like on pixel you could mimic it in this way."

"s22 ultra vs s23+ where i live, the prices are roughly the same and i can easily find a brand new s22 ultra.

i really love the design of the ultra more but the newest ultra is quite out of my price range and i wonder if it would actually make sense choosing a year old ultra over the s23+.

i know the performance and battery life is going to be worse but i don't know how worse and i have no idea about any other component (like camera or screen).

i would like to see your choice and hear your opinions.

"you know that 5ghz band wifi6 issue most s22/s23 ultras has been having? i may have found a good temporary solution for this. so i've been dealing with this for over a year now, trying everything under the sun to get this to work and i noticed that the majority of the time the issue happens with asus routers. and ironically i have one too, an rt-ax86u to be exact. 

so after a lot of research & trial and error, i found myself a good temporary solution that has been working for over a week now, with the wifi signal lagging very briefly on a rare occasion, with maybe one time where i thought the issue came back but the whole internet was down instead üòÖ.

so here's what i did:

1. no smart switch was used to set up my s23 ultra. never liked it to be honest. i use samsung cloud and google drive via google one to back up everything & i keep all my stuff in the cloud so it was only a re-download of what was needed. and i only brought back only my messages & call log, cuz i'm forgetful üòÖ. i also manually added my wifi to my phone, i didn't bring it over. i also cleared it from my known wifi networks as well beforehand.

2. i switched the router's software from asusmerlin back to stock asus software, and updated it to the most stable version. get it from asus directly & install it via the web gui.

3. i did both the hard factory reset and the normal factory reset after i updated the router. there's two versions of it apparently. i did the version where you are physically pressing buttons to do it, and then i did the normal one on the web gui. look up hard factory reset *insert router name here* and it'll give you the way to do it for that particular version.

4. went through initial router set-up normally. kept the same name & password, **stick to wpa2 security, you'll see why in a second**

5. *on the phone* turned on developer settings on the phone, turned on wifi safe mode.

6. settings, connections, wifi, tap on the 3 dots on the top right and choose intelligent wifi & turn off prioritize real-time data.

7. *in web gui for the router* turn off 802.11ax/wifi 6 mode. it's in wireless. make sure you do it for both bands (the first section will be which band you're editing, choose accordingly)

8. i actually kept on the 160 mhz option for the 5ghz because i want my speed dammit. hasn't affected anything.

9. switched my dns (including ipv6) out of cloudflare to a different dns, i used google. ipv4 is in the wan section, ipv6 is in the ipv6 section (switch only if you actually have that one normally) **i didn't try different dns options, google was always my second choice, my focus was not using cloudflare. try different ones and see, i was always having issues with cloudflare**

10. **for fun cuz why not** restart everything. phone, router, and modem if you're feeling fancy. why? it doesn't hurt so might as well.



that's it. no phone mac. no static ip on the phone. i'm on my 5ghz band consistently and it works almost flawlessly. granted i would love to have wifi6 available to me so i can get a better router with the 6ghz band as an option, but being able to use my 5ghz in a stable way on my phone when i need that is more important to me. so there we go."
how am i suposed to remove the clear case i got with my s23 ultr? it sits on like a verry strong magnet. and i almost break my fingers trying to remove it. is there a trick?
"why did samsung stop making affordable tablets with s-pen i don't understand why they removed the s-pen from the a series the bezel are now thicker and the aspect ratio is weird it looks elongated, maybe it's just me but it looks kinda ugly they should've just keep the tab a8 with s-pen body and give it better internals.

the tab a 8.4 (2020) would be such a good contender for the ipad mini if it had with better internals + s-pen they have similar screen size but the tab a 8.4's bezels is significantly thinner plus it'll probably be more affordable, maybe they won't be comparable performance wise but it'll be the second best mini tablet available and i can see a lot of business using it too"

2. i need to manually switch to the buds via the tv remote. i understand that there won't be an auto switch option for my tv(2021 range) but the moment i disconnect my buds the tv defaults back to the tv speaker instead of my default soundbar setup. is there any way to change this? maybe a short cut using smart things to switch between bluetooth and sound bar that i'm overlooking? 

due to the above reasons i haven't really used my buds often with my tv and that sucks since the sound quality is truly great and i can only use them on my tab and phone."

"is the s pen water resistant on the s22 ultra and s23 ultra? right from samsung's website, https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ans00077679/

""the following phones carry an ip68 rating:

note20 5g and note20 ultra 5g, including the s pen

note10, note10+, and note10+ 5g, including the s pen

s23, s23+, and s23 ultra

s22, s22+, and s22 ultra"" 

it doesn't specifically say s pen for the s series as it does for the note series. just wondering if samsung ever confirmed one way or another as i like to use the s pen in the bath/hot tub."
"bixby text-to-call needs a customizable intro message so far everyone i've shown it to thinks it's cool, but they would hang up in the first few seconds thinking they dialed the wrong number or it was unavailable or something. a short message like ""hi, this is <name> using text-to-speech"" would be far more useful. it can already do custom text, so this should be pretty straightforward if samsung isn't hung up on forcing us to throw ""bixby"" out there."

is battery life the only exciting thing s23 series has going for it? all i see are posts and posts about how amazing the battery life is (or lack of). is that the only thing people are concerned about now? why not buy a chinese brand that can charge to 100% in 10 minutes?

"avoid pixel phones i've had my pixel 7 for under a month, and i've had to contact customer support on a few things, firstly my 3 months free youtube premium to which they stated if you have already used any free trial then you cannot use this. i told them i have used a free trial but there's an option for another free month to which i have activated and sent the screenshot stating that isn't the issue. they told me well we can't do anything about it. 

my next issue was the trade in services and how my phone got rejected for screen burns, i sent them the pictures clearly showing there are no burns. they said they have escalated it to the highest tier and their response was because it has been returned we can't do much but here you go a free 40¬£ gift card. if this is there responses a month into my new phone what will it be when my phone experiences any hardware or software issues. to put it simply i don't trust this brand and i will not purchase a pixel phone anytime in the near future.

i will be switching back to samsung as it's more reliable, has better stock apps, consistent pictures, quick menu and widgets are inconveniently too large with no added benefit, google photos and gallery's are light years behind samsung gallery in terms of customisation, google keyboard and microsoft as well. i've had to download a couple of apps because samsung had irmt stock google didn't for example samsung pass, background media player, music player, that's actually good and customisable, samsung notes, if your screen is off you can't hold to reduce the volume you have to tap it to reduce it or turn the screen on to hold it - i use this alot when i'm sleeping so it's a daily issue but exclusive to me. not sure why wifi and data are not separate options and sometimes weirdly turns on wifi and connects me even though i've had it off, i had to install a new app that allows me to add documents or pictures as a shortcut on the home screen

as for what's good from the pixel: it's smoooth, above average battery life, i like the ss features, when the picture is good it's amazing, dnd works amazing - miles ahead of samsung, others i can't think of as of right now. 

all in all its a great phone but compared to samsung i definitely have missed a lot of features and the customer service with samsung is top notch compared to google and this is why i am making the move, ofcourse backed with the downsides that i have with the phone."

"s23 ultra best camera setups - issue with indoor high contrast scenes though been comparing shots on the samsung s23 ultra i just got to my note 20 ultra.  as expected, it's not a night and day difference of course.  but in most scenes, the s23 ultra produces moderately better results with the biggest difference when using expert raw in 50mp mode both jpg and raw output (while the latter is going to be better for post editing.  i imagine 200mp is good too but i'm passing on that large of file size).

i found what i think though is a limitation in the camera software (or sensor).  hopefully samsung will fix it in a future update. it is for moderately low light indoor photos (like late afternoon and overcast with no indoor lighting turned on), but where you have a bright scene through the windows (like snowy mountains).  i imagine this happens in any room where you have bright window scene and not a bright room. 

the normal camera on the note20 ultra does much better metering and doesn't blow out the scene in the windows.  the s23 ultra comes very close if using the normal camera in 12mp mode but at best it's equal to the note in other tests the s23 ultra totally blew out the window scene where the note 20 ultra didn't.  in this test scene it got a little worse in 50mp mode.  then it gets even worse in pro mode.  in expert raw it is bad too in some circumstances no matter what metering mode you select or exposure setting.  if you are lucky to get a decent shot in expert raw you can tweak the raw output in adobe lightroom, but it's still not as good as the normal camera mode on both phones! where as most other shot scenes, the expert raw in 50mp mode is superior to the other modes and anything the note 20 ultra puts out, but you need to zoom in on the photo to really notice the difference.  (safe to say if you're a note 20 ultra user (or s21/22 ultra), you're not missing out much as the 200mp sensor in the s23 ultra is as i expected part modest improvement and part a lot of marketing hype.)

here's a comparison between normal 12mp camera output on note 20 and s23 ultra, then an adobe lightroom edited raw image coming from expert raw on the s23 ultra in 12mp mode.  

so the end conclusion is that in the current state of the software, on the s23 ultra, for high contrast moderate natural light indoor shots like this, you are best just using the standard 12mp auto mode in the regular camera app. whereas in most other situations you get the best quality with reasonable file size shooting in expert raw at 50mp.

"s23 ultra wifi 6 connectivity issue bug still not fixed with february update (awbe) just installed the february update and unfortunately the infamous and widely reported wifi 6 bug has still not been fixed. we will now have to wait for another month for the next update, if samsung finally decides to acknowledge this bug and fix it. 

the reports are so numerous they are on multiple forums. it is clearly a driver issue that samsung needs to fix.

3. [xda thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/wifi-trouble.4549663/)

for me and from many reports, this happens on all wifi 6 networks, at home and at work and outside at the mall. it is not an issue with some particular configuration or router. it is an issue with the s23 ultra wifi software/driver and how it handles wifi 6 networks. it does not seem happen on wifi 5 or wifi 6e from the reports and my experience, so switching to either will resolve the issue until samsung fixes it.

samsung, please acknowledge this bug at the least on your own forums and tell us you are going to fix it! keeping us in the dark is worse than having an expected timeline to fix it."

i have seen mixed reports about the z flip 4 but mainly comparing it to the very top tier phones - what are people's thoughts on the camera coming from a more budget phone? i don't do a huge amount of photography just have a few events coming up and want to get some decent pictures of family and friends and for various reasons, a folding phone would be super handy for me providing the trade off on spec isn't enormous."

i was on lte all the time. first i was on a train for about 45min. i wasn't really using my phone all the time maybe for like half of the ride. then i used my phone for about 35min with 1% brightness and extra dim set to maximum intensity. after that, during the day i was checking some social media etc. with higher brightness and then went back on a train with similar usage. and holy, my battery just got sucked. you might argue that i had poor signal in the train but it was like half of my total usage today and i shouldn't get 2h sot in any conditions! beside the train i had a great signal as i was in the city center. how is your battery life after oneui 5.1? also, note that i had most of my apps in deep sleep, smart suggestions off, and i followed most of the battery saving tips and tricks besides the power saving mode(i won't give up on 120hz)."
"cancelling order (+cancelling trade-in) so in my other post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11b0fks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11b0fks/)) i was debating keeping the s23 ultra due to the size.

i decided not to keep it since i just can't get happy with it and have to trust my gut feeling here.

when i purchased, i paid just over ¬£800 including a bunch of discounts and a trade in discount of ¬£290 for my existing phone. (which i have not yet sent to them)

i spoke to samsung about returning the s23 ultra , and they said they would refund me the ¬£800 when i return the phone, and since i would not be sending my s20 to them, would be charged ¬£290 from the trade in team.

i can't get my head around how this would make sense, because in my mind , the ¬£290 discount would only be applicable if i kept the device , but since i'm cancelling altogether, can't see how that is logical?

am i getting this wrong?

tldr : paid ¬£800 , got the s23 ultra , would have cost me ¬£290 more without a trade in, didn't send the trade in, cancelling order, should be getting ¬£800 back and calling it a day?"

"my experience with s23 ultra, coming from pixel 7 pro let me start with the problems i had with my pixel 7 pro, which pushed me to get the s23 ultra.

as someone who is constantly trying to capture videos of my cats all day long, p7 pro was just not a great device. don't get me wrong, if the lighting was good, videos were decent. but most of my indoor shots had a lot of noise. evening and night time videos were average at best unless i had got some good lighting setup.

another issue i had was overheating and battery life, if i was shooting 4k videos, the battery just didn't last as long. editing videos on the phone wasn't that great either... tensor's subpar performance really made editing slower and the device would just get hot quickly. i saw that warning multiple times where it would say that the device is too hot to continue shooting and it had barely been 5 mins of 4k 30fps recording.

i came from iphone 13 pro before p7 pro so all of these issues with video recording and performance annoyed me a lot. i didn't want to go back to apple ecosystem because let's just say that i got bored from ios and wanted to experience android again.

i preordered s23 ultra on the launch day and have had the device for about a week now. i'm really happy with the performance and video quality so far. although i'm not a professional videographer, i have tried shooting some 8k clips of my cats, and i really like the end result, and even uploaded it to youtube. i've been able to record 4k 60 fps for longer than 10 mins, and have not really seen any overheating warnings so far. phone has just gotten warm once when i downloaded like 40gb of data over 5g network in one go.

video editing feels smoother and a better display with s pen really helps here with precision. i'm mostly editing for reels/shorts, and i've been very happy with the results so far. battery life is much better and i charge my device once every day.

only thing i would say that i miss from pixel 7 pro is shutter speed. samsung is not too bad but i definitely feel the difference and before anyone points out, i've already installed the camera assistant app and turned on the faster shutter setting. but that's just for shutter lag, not shutter speed.

if my cats are moving too much, i am mostly taking a video and not a picture, so the shutter speed factor doesn't bother me as much. s23 ultra is just a better overall camera experience for me.

i don't do any gaming on my phone so i can't say much about in that area.

overall, i'm a happy s23 ultra user.

both my wife‚Äôs watch and mine bricked by a bad firmware update.  out of warranty and samsung philippines initially refused to repair it even though samsung firmware bricked it!  had to raise this higher up the food chain to resolve but took weeks.

  

\-	samsung fold screen reliability

my fold 3 main screen failed at 18 months old.  anecdotal evidence from friends on social media seemed to suggest this is common, usually somewhere between 18 months to 24 months.  some of my friends with samsung folding screen devices have even had 2 different models and they have had both different models fail in this timeframe.  as it‚Äôs outside of warranty samsung want at least $700 to repair it presumably so it can fail again at some point in the future?

   

this has now left me with 6 samsung tags that appear to be useless as i‚Äôm not likely buying another samsung phone.

  

would be interesting to hear in the comments from people who have had any samsung folding phone for a long period (at least 18 months?) to see how they feel about their reliability.

  

\-	[samsung s23 screen wrinkle](https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-screen-wrinkle) 

(i‚Äôve not suffered this, included as evidence of continued failure)

although this is still new and no one really knows for sure how many are affected, it‚Äôs clearly a defect and the excuse from samsung is on par with apples ‚Äúyour holding it wrong‚Äù.  this is not a cheap phone and neither is the waterproofing/dustproofing process so, why has it only appear on these new models?  manufacturing or design defect?  it doesn‚Äôt matter how minor it is, it‚Äôs still a defect and under uk law (at least when i was at school) a product had to be ‚Äúfree from minor defect‚Äù or could be returned.

  

samsung have cost me well over $2000 in wasted money (lest we not also forget time!) and peripherals i no longer have a use for.  given this i don‚Äôt think i can trust samsung anymore as either their design, manufacture or qa (or combination) just seem to be failing and these are the issues i‚Äôm aware of, i‚Äôm guessing there might be more. 

  

how many of you feel like you can still trust samsung mobile?  specially interested in folding screen phone owners because \*\*maybe\*\* you can give me the trust i need to spend $700 repairing rather than just buying a \*\*brand new\*\* pixel 7 pro, motorola edge 30 ultra or oneplus for the same money?"
"s23 silicon lottery won i've just made 2023 points single score as well as 5337 multicore in geekbehnch 6 (#samsung in good manufacturing plants is back in business). which puts it almost right en par with the iphone (in terms of cpu performance, base iphone 14 at 2224 single score and 5339 multicore).

time to celebrate guys as an android user.

it's sad that samsung's exynos processor failed so bad. especially since my s10, when it was an amazing and powerful soc.

but samsung burnt european users with that chip (incapable to keep up with the competition, including system lags) it is questionable whether they will gain back their trust and mine.

i feel samsung should acquire qualcomm and let their own failed attempt of making an own chip go.

rest of the world (row) doesn't have any idea what we had to deal with (as europeans (for the past 3 years, we had been the guinea pig with their exynos attempt and it failed lately.

samsung generally should learn from it and make one chip for their phone anywhere else in the world and make a firm decision on what to do (apple's own soc as an example) and not create two classes of users on the same phone.

now i couldn't care less with my s23 but boy oh boy did samsung burn me with their european s22,  i will not forget this samsung."
"we need bypass charging for the entire os and not just gaming! i have a tab s8 ultra and i love it. i have a powerful laptop but, for daily drive i use the tab, as it is ""smaller"". you know, samsung recently came up with charging bypass for games, which i always wanted for my laptop, for years!!. i always though, why the f not they don't just bypass charging. let me have the option to use internal battery as ups. if the electricity cut, use the battery, but don't charge it, until its under (i don't know) 30%. you would think, in this era, it would be a piece of cake for companies, but for some reason, they just don't do it.

and finally, finally, a company did it. but just for gaming??? dude, these phones and tablets have dex mode! make the charge bypass for the entire os. you can hide it under some deeper settings if you don't trust ""not-so-tech-savvy"" users messing up thier tablets and blaming it on you, but do it please. hell, make it void warranty if you so wish to, but make it available to me. i beg of you. you would increase my interaction with the tablet and phone 10 folds. and who knows maybe some other companies follow your footprint on this.

i am writing this here, on the hopes that someone somewhat important in the company sees this, however low it is. i really would love a this to happen."

"discussion: does anyone have experience with mirroring two phones?

a potential solution would be to leave the larger samsung s23  in my bag most of the time, with a smaller and lighter phone which simply mirrors the larger phone via bluetooth or 5g. the principle is similar to how i use parsec to give my laptop the powers of my desktop pc.

"close to 9 hours of screen on time with the s23 ultra. so i was undecided whether to upgrade to the s23 ultra after it was announced. my s21 ultra was in pretty good shape (aside from a cracked back) 

never had any stuttering problems. never was sluggish. i didn't even manage to fill up the 256gb capacity within 2 years of use. 

but, after a couple of weeks contemplating, i decided to pull the trigger and get the s23 ultra.

to be honest, there's not a massive difference between the two phones that hits you in the face. the jump didn't feel anywhere as massive as it did when i went from the s9 plus to the s21 ultra. 

except for one aspect. battery life. i had just gotten close to 9 hours of sot with wifi and bluetooth both on. 

i mostly browsed reddit, an hour in a half of youtube, about 2 hours of gaming and some social media browsing.

this obviously isnt the heaviest of loads, but its the same routine i did with my s21 ultra, and that phone only lasted me about 6 hours, 7 the most.

"how to enable cast support in media output switcher (one ui 5.1) the one ui 5.1 changelogs specifically called out ""**media output for wi-fi speakers**"" feature stating: *""if you want to continue listening to music on wi-fi speakers via spotify connect and built-in chromecast, just open media output from the quick access toolbar, not from the music app""*

but after getting the galaxy s23+ running one ui 5.1 i was disappointed when i first tried to switch playback from my phone to google home speakers using the 'media output' button in notification shade. it showed all my google cast devices, but it took several seconds to switch output to them and it didn't have any of the rich cast experience with album art and song information, just showed text 'default media receiver' or something.

but tonight i accidently discovered a non-obvious setting page where you can change it from what appears to be miracast mirroring, to actually use the google cast protocol. apps need to be updated to support it, but it works great! think it's only youtube and youtube music at the moment.

**instructions (screenshots here:** [**https://imgur.com/a/hg8qemp**](https://imgur.com/a/hg8qemp)**)**

1. click on 'media output' in notification shade
2. click the 'gear' in top-right
3. click on wi-fi speaker playback preference
4. select 'casting' to use google cast instead of the default 'mirroring'

"my experience after 1 week from an iphone 12 pro max i recently switched from the iphone 12 pro max and made a post about my switch and some folks said i will be back to using an iphone after and that i am in a honeymoon phase and blah blah blah. well one week later, i have never been happier about making the switch. this has been my experience so far after a week.

battery life: i started out with a decent  sot of around 5 hours. i have to say this is not really bad and as someone who works a lot and does not mind charging my phone once or twice a day, sot is sufficient for me. but i decided to see if i could push it further. so i decided to optimize my phone and here's how i did it:

1) i never charge the phone when the phone is hot. this is very important even than turning on to protect the battery.

2) i also realized adaptive brightness was overestimating the brightness i needed. so i set up modes and routines for the times i get home and around the times i sleep. around the time i get home, my at home mode sets the brightness to 4% which is more than enough for me. around the time i sleep, i have a routine set to turn off the phone if i plug the charger in to keep the phone cool and it also turns to protect the battery on to keep the phone's battery from stress overnight.

3) i also make sure to close apps i am not using anymore so the ram doesn't try to keep it open + ram uses a significant amount of battery.

after doing this sot went from 5 hours to 9-11 hours depending on the use which involved watching netflix(the screen is so good lol), using social media, reading, etc.

camera: 

the camera out of the box was great but it somehow didn't process some pics properly imo. but somehow it's like it got better overnight. the pics coming out of the phone are crazy good now not even kidding. some portraits shots  i took the other day of my kid look like they were professionally photographed. i can't explain what i did to improve the camera so much but one thing i noticed is that the more lighting the better. also being stable when taking a photo really helps. won't decide to go into shutter lag because that's a whole post of its own.

other:

apps run smoothly with like one lag because i have labs turned on (which they did mention could cause some lags), spen has been amazing been using it more times than i can count, pop out the pen, write something on aod, pin it, and never forget.

 review after a week:  i still think this is the best phone out there. with all the features it provides. there are many other things that i could go on and on about the phone but that will make this post too long. not saying it's perfect, i don't expect it to be and after one week it's one of the best purchases i have made in a while.

ps: one thing i really dislike about the phone is samsung emojis. pure shit. thank god android is highly customizable. i currently use iphone emojis on my s23 ultra. please leave any more tips that can help me better optimize my phone. thanks"
"s23 ultra: does the s-pen colour match your phone? hi all, i've had my s23 ultra for almost a week now and am super happy about my device. i absolutely love it! however, and this might be nitpicking, i know, i noticed that the s-pen does not match my device. when purchasing my device, i was in doubt between green and lavender. ultimately, i liked the green more so ordered that one (the 512gb version). however, upon receiving my device, i noticed that the top of the s-pen is black, not green. i checked the samsung website again and i can see a green top on the s-pen there, which i like much more. i contacted samsung and they asked me to send them pictures of my s-pen and the pictures from the website. they will get back to me later.

now i'm left wondering. am i the only one with the wrong colour? here you can see what i am talking about: https://imgur.com/a/t8oynr2

is this the case for other colours too? it's super weird because when i look up pictures online, the s-pen tip colour always matches the phone."

"repurposing my s10 - ideas and suggestions? hi all,

recently, i made the switch from my trusty samsung galaxy s10 to the newer, more advanced s23 ultra. while i love my new device, i couldn't help but notice that my s10 is still in great condition and fully functional, except for its battery life. so, i've been thinking about ways to repurpose it and make the most out of it.

i'm curious to hear how other people have repurposed their older smartphones. have you found any creative uses for your old devices? maybe you've integrated them into a work desk setup or found a way to use them as a security camera or music player.

personally, i'm considering using my s10 as a dedicated music player or a bedside clock with an alarm feature. i've also heard of people using their old devices as a home security camera, a remote control for their smart home devices, or even as a backup phone in case of emergency.

if anyone has any other suggestions or ideas, i would love to hear them. it would be great to repurpose my s10 in a way that adds value to my daily routine and reduces e-waste.

thanks in advance for your input!"
"s22+ bluetooth name is very weird instead of my bluetooth name coming as 'galaxy s22+', it comes as

"s23 ultra's wifi problem seems to happen only on wifi 6 routers; no issues if using wifi 5 so like many people, i had the issue of my 23 ultra getting the ""connected without internet"" error when connected to my wifi 6 router (tp-link ex221-g2u), forcing the phone to default to mobile data (thank god i have 160gb a month).

suspecting it had something with the wifi 6 protocol, i swapped back to my old wifi 5 router. the phone has since maintained the connection for more than 24 hours, where before it would drop the wifi 6 connection within an hour or two.

it's my only wifi 6 device; all my other wifi 5 devices connect just fine to the wifi 6 router (defaulting to the wifi 5 protocol). none of the other setting tweaks shared by others seem to work.

does anyone know if there is a way to force the s23 ultra to operate solely on the wifi 5 5ghz protocol, through a wifi 6 router?

edit: added my exact router model. also, managed to disable 802.11ax (wifi 6) on my router so it defaults to 802.11ac (wifi 5), and it's been very stable so far. but it's just a workaround for now and not a true fix because those of us with this problem cannot use our phones to their advertised potential."
"can samsung stop messing with routines? anyone knows where i can post ""feedback"" for samsung to read?

i have 1 single routine, which is ""night time"". set to turn on at 12am-9am, which will trigger a bunch of stuff (dnd, night filter, etc.).

previously on oneui 4, when it was just ""routines"", i was able to just use a quick toggle to disable all routines if i decide that i don't want my ""night time"" routine to be running at say 2am, then toggle it again to turn it on when i want it back on.

then with oneui 5, they made it ""modes & routines"", and the quick toggle stopped working. so i had to go into the modes & routines app to disable/enable the routine whenever i want to.

now with oneui 5.1, they once again messed with it. if i disable the routine when it's running, i can't re-enable it for some reason.

this is so frustrating, it was working fine in oneui 4, why did they add modes and screwed everything up."
"s23 ultra i used a mi note 10 lite for 2.5 years, squeezed 4-6 hours sot with auto brightness, no bt, no gps, with s23u i got 8 hours and it is still learning(today 2.5 hours  sot with 20% auto brightness, 4g, 60hz, light  performance mode and i restored everything with smart switch).

100% satisfied"

"samsung customer service just wanted to put this out there. i'm in a bunch of different subreddits related to samsung and their products. i am constantly seeing people say something to the effect of ""great products but the worst customer service of any company"". 

i've been using their products almost exclusively for the last 10 years and am not the easiest customer in terms of expectations. meaning i'll send my phone in for a repair/service more than a few times over the course of that time. i have never had a bad experience with them. my issues always get solved with minimal headache. and i would even say dealing with them is almost always a pleasant experience. there was only one occasion where i was almost let down. last year, after 4 or 5 months of ownership, i sent in my z fold 3 to get the main display replaced as it had started to develop little cracks down the center of the crease. but the main display did have accidental damage on it that i caused within the first week of ownership. (a few dead pixels) but the two were not related. after i sent in the phone, they basically said it wouldn't be covered under warranty and they would need $500 to replace the display.  i called samsung after seeing that email and complained about how the two issues are unrelated and the agent said that she would try to see if she can get that point across and get the screen replaced under warranty. i wasn't expecting much after we got off the phone since i had been hearing so many people complain about their customer service. anyway, i got an email a few hours later stating that the repair was made under warranty and the phone was being overnighted to me.

since this post is much longer than i had anticipated, i won't explain the pleasant experience i had with them over the past few days. just know that as somebody who deals with samsung customer service at least once a year, i have never been let down. and i would even say that of all the companies i have dealt with, samsung, in my experience, has had by far the best customer service."
"s23 light-mode experiences going to keep it brief as i can. testing light mode on the base s23 which claims ~30-40% power/heat savings for ~10% performance off the top on the s23.

**performance:** i cannot force a scenario where i notice the 10% performance hit. i've even tested it with skyline emulator (something that pushes the soc to the max, yet samsung does not detect as a game so light mode appears to be intact).

**battery:** a definite boost but its within a range that might seem placebo but seems a bit too good to be just that. ~5-10% increase which on the s23 which already had solid battery life is actually a good bit of time. i think the impact to battery life with dex usage and while multitasking in general was pretty noticeable 

**heat:** biggest benefit by miles. android auto with gps (wired and wireless) ends up ice-cold, dex and multitasking (was already not so bad) doesn't even warm it up, really it's only tasks that kick the gpu on that will heat up the phone anymore.

**conclusion / my 2-cents:** if you can't specify a need for the max clockspeeds (excluding gaming when light mode disables itself) then you should absolutely be using light mode, or at the very least try it out for a few days. outside of geekbench i absolutely never used/felt the top 10% of this sd8g2(fg).. but i definitely feel these efficiency benefits."
"s22 was the worst decision ever i got the s22 for my birthday in december 2022 and i feel like i made my parents waste 700‚Ç¨. my previous phone (2019-2022) was s10e and before that an s4 so, although i like iphone better, i'm more comfortable with samsung but this phone (s22) doesn't feel like an upgrade in any way. here are the 2 main things i suffer the most with this phone:

1. selfie camera is disgusting. in social media apps (whatsapp, bereal, ig...) if there's low light, the pic will turn out grey, it doesn't capture any color and my face has patches of my skin tone color in a grey background. quality is awful. 

2. charging takes forever. i don't know why but  i cannot use my phone while charging because it doesn't charge at all, it just maintains the same % or charges 1%/5min. literally today i was doing breakfast while watching yt in the background, my phone started at 24% and in the course of exactly an hour, it only charged up to 31%. that's 7% in 60 minutes = 1% every 8 minutes. and i use the cable that comes with the phone.

overall experience: as a regular person, not an expert, not a computer fan etc... this phone hasn't given me any new things, or improved in almost any way what i had in the s10e. i feel like the only thing i've noticed is the smoothness of a brand new phone vs a 3year old phone with tons of pics, apps in there which isn't really a point for the s22 because that's the purpose of buying a new phone. but even with barely 3 months of use, it still has its moments of running slow and bugging itself. 

as i said in the begging of the post, i feel like i (my parents) wasted 700‚Ç¨ and that i'm going to be stuck with this crap the next 3-5 years. if anyone out here has had the same experience as me, please share it so that way i know that i'm not alone or crazy. and if your experience with the s22 has been the complete opposite of this, share it too and hopefully give me tips on how i can get 100% of s22."

"so i just got my s23 ultra 1tb for an insane price directly from samsung today was the big day, i sold my iphone 14 pro max and picked up a s23 ultra but things went better than expected. 

i went to the samsung store and asked for a 512gb version, they didn't have any laying around but they did have the 1tb version. i asked them how much it would cost me and i was shocked.   
so rn in europe they have a sale going on where you can get the 1tb variant for the price of a 512gb variant, this would mean it would cost ‚Ç¨1579, the guy who helped me then asked if i had a phone i could trade in and i told him i just sold my iphone but i had an old lg g6 with broken screen with me as my backup. he said he could take it in and provide another ‚Ç¨200 discount if i did that (for a phone that's worth absolutely nothing). then he asked me if i were a student (i am) which was another ‚Ç¨157 discount. 

all in all, i got the phone for ‚Ç¨1222 which is insane! i can't express how happy i am! just wanted to share this information for anyone still on the fence, the time is now!"

i shipped my trade-in device and the extra s23+ on february 17th. the trade-in device was fine, but samsung sent me an unboxing video of the s23+ with the box destroyed and retaped with no phone. 

i contacted samsung yesterday, and after chatting and providing some photos, they confirmed my refund, but given that last time they also guaranteed something that never happened, i am really concerned.

"samsung a53 5g vs s21fe vs s23 plus hey everyone, my dad loves my new s23 ultra and wants a new phone aswell  he currently has an a32 5g and wants to upgrade to something faster and nicer.  i upgraded to an s23 ultra from an s20 fe and got my mom an a14 5g from an a5 (2017). i don't think an s23 plus would honestly benefit him. firstly, it's super expensive, and he uses his phone for basic things ( web browsing, youtube, news, etc, ). but, him sacrifice everything for us i want to reward him with something nice.  my options are either the a53 5g (i looked at the a52 but the overall performance for the a53 is better) or the s21 fe, which is honestly super fast or the s23 plus. what is the best bang for the buck?"

just got my s23ultra and was very excited to get it with all the discounts samsung was giving to customers in canada.

i think it has to be a bad wifi card. anyone else has had similar issue with s23ultra?

i use google nest router and with my s20fe i never had a connection problem.

update** - thank you all for your kind and quick responses. i did restart the router and modem and the phone and seems most of the time to be ok now.

"is it just me or is the camera on the base s23 actually terrible? want to move off the iphone. finally europe gets snapdragon. pre order s23. physically, the device is amazing. great display, great speakers, great size, can remove almost all the bloatware. 
but the camera‚Ä¶is terrible.

***12 mp photos*** - great in good lighting. grainy and blurry as shit indoors.

***50 mp photos*** - wtf. takes 5 seconds to process and turns up hdr and saturation to a 100 with scene recognition off. this can be resolved by installing the camera assistant and setting the shutter speed to prioritise speed over quality and turning on the scene recognition. when you prioritise speed, it doesn‚Äôt apply the post processing. but the hit to quality is noticeable.

***shutter lag*** - i didn‚Äôt think this would be an issue. but it is. tried to sort this out via the camera assistant, but still blurry photos of my kid. i did a side by side comparison by taking photos from both, the s23 and my iphone and the iphone took 12 photos while the s23 took 6.
the lag is unbearable. 

my wife tried to take some photos from the car and they were all blurry and the focus was all over the place. 
never happens with the iphone. 

**expertraw** - 

***50 mp***- horrible over processed , green tinted photos. akin to non raw 50 mp ones. it‚Äôs supposed to be raw ? with little to no processing. it‚Äôs especially horrible at night. raises all shadows, saturation and hdr 100%

https://youtu.be/mvro53abppk

***12 mp*** - fine again. 

tried toggling auto hdr in settings. didn‚Äôt help. 

***video*** - 

always starts off choppy, but smoothes out eventually. 
also notice the lights in the videos taken at night to be flickering a lot. 

all this over processing also means i never know how a photo is going to turn out. i‚Äôm looking at something and expect to take a photo of what i see. 10 seconds later, you have a photo that is over processed to shit with it looking nothing like what i see. 

maybe i got a dud. 

i have raised a return and will be keeping my iphone. 
saw a bunch of reviews praising the cameras but am left disappointed. 
would get a pixel if google started selling them officially in my country.
i guess i‚Äôm stuck with apple till then.

edit - added a link to a video where you can see the insane processing / colour shifts on the 50 mp shots."

"please bring back wingtips for the buds or a wingtip design. i am one of those people who cant fit the earbuds. ive had the ogs with wingtip fittings, the bud 2 pros i just got with my s23, and whatever those buds were when they first got rid of tips. none of them work. im 6ft tall and use these things when im working out. these buds are not designed with durability in mind. ive destroyed 2 buds because they fell out of my ear and cant survive a 6ft drop. samsung please stop with this apple thing where you guys care about how a product looks vs how it works with real world use.  i had this same issue with the z fold series constantly aiming to get thinner instead of getting a larger battery and internal s pen. sleek isnt always the way. i remember back when you guys sold rugged ugly versions of the s series for people who activities put their devices at risk. i miss the old samsung man. love some of you guys products but as a former fold user and a customer on his last pair of buds ever, i wish you'd find your way. i dont know why i can't fit your buds. my old jabras were great until someone stole them, but your buds were a great option until this direction."

"returning the ultra for the plus... y'all, i'm pained to say it, but i'm returning my beloved ultra for the s23+ for both hand-size issues and financial issues üòì i got a great deal on the plus, and it's coming sometime today. for those of you who opted for the regular 23/ 23 plus, how are you liking it? is it a beast in its own right? i've heard good things, but i'd love to hear more hype about it before i get it!

edit: ok. i take it back. i somehow got a better deal on an ultra order with my trade in, and i'm getting a new ultra and returning the plus. i am thrilled! my hands won't be, though."
"s20+ (and 13 pro max) owner, looking at s23+/u i went to the store to hold each of them in my hand, i can't talk about the performance or the camera at this point, so i will just limit my comments to the feeling of the phones on your hand.

**s20+**  
i just love the feeling. mine has a case because i don't want to break if if i drop it, but without the case it's the most comfortable phone i ever had. size is perfect, rounded edges are very comfy to hold. if it had dynamic refresh and better camera, it would be perfect.

**iphone 13 pro max**  
i have this because of work. i hardly use it because the flat edges/sides are so uncomfortable to hold in my hands. plus it's extremely big and heavy. maybe i'm biased because i don't like apple products, but i would very much prefer a smaller iphone, can't really understand why someone would want the bigger version of the phones besides to have the best.

**s23+**  
i so much wanted to like it. i don't care about the s-pen at all, so my first thought was getting the s23+, although i would love to have the same screen (1-120hz) and cameras as the ultra. but the flat edges... feels exactly like the iphone 13 pro max... too uncomfortable to hold! and the fact that it feels mid-flagship due to the features... i don't know. imo the plus and u should each share more similarities in terms of hardware, except the shape and s-pen.

**s23u**  
i was surprised, it is as big as my s20+ without a case. it means phones are not getting bigger, but a bit smaller. i'm not a fan of the squared shape, but the edges are soft/rounded like the s20+ which makes it comfy to hold in your hands. and because it's not actually bigger, for my hands it's perfect. i just dislike that it has the s-pen (could live without it), and the overall squared shape is not my cup of tea.

i'm not sure which one to buy. i'm really torn between the plus and ultra. so much that i'm considering skipping this generation completely. my s20+ (march 2020) still feels good as new. i like to change my phone every 2-3 years but can't find enough reasons yet.

any other s20+ owners willing to share their experiences with the s23 lineup?"
"for apple to release an equivalent phone to the s23u they need to release a phone to have the same features as the iphone 14 pro plus the following the phone needs to support usb c, fast charging speeds, 10+ microlens, and integrated pen. apple has a lot to cover this year. iphone 14 pro is known for their better battery and cameras this year s23u literally wins in every category. maybe iphone still better in video taking but that is also debatable."

"uproar preloaded songs once upon a time i had a samsung uproar, sph-m100. the first mp3 phone. it was great and i loved it. it came preloaded with 2-3 songs and though it‚Äôs been over 20 years, i sometimes feel like listening to them again. however, i can‚Äôt find anywhere online that lists the songs. my old uproar is in a box somewhere in storage, but i had definitely deleted the songs to take advantage of the full 64 mb of storage. 

did anyone else have one of these? i‚Äôm hoping someone else had one and remembers the songs. also, weren‚Äôt they cool?"

"iphone 13 pro to s23 ultra anyone make the switch from ios to android? i currently have the 13 pro but i‚Äôm growing so tired of iphone‚Äôs‚Ä¶. the signal is spotty at best in any fringe areas and it‚Äôs always switching to 3g and the phone is basically useless. i have had a s23 in my hands side by side with the iphone and it had zero issues with signal while the iphone just sits and waits. i am not tied into apples ecosystem as i only have a watch which i hardly wear. besides sending the odd video over text, i could care less about imessage. just curious if anyone made the switch and regretted it? i always see videos and read about people switching on youtube but that is usually click bait and or a crock of crap as they still have the other phone to go back to. looking for some genuine input from anyone that may have made the switch knowing there is no going back for 2 years. i always used android since gingerbread but switched when the ip 7 came out and have been with apple ever since. don‚Äôt care about 5 years support or resale value as they are both mute points and irrelevant in my case. thanks in advance for any input!!"

how is your experience with s23+? i'm thinking of downgrading my s23 ultra to plus. how is your experience with the plus so far?
"damn you, samsung! why can't samsung just put premium specs into the plus model? i have had an s23 ultra in my possession for a week and i'm still not sold on moving from the form factor of the s22 plus. the s23 ultra has a great camera, the s pen, 12gb of ram and a beautiful display, but i'm still looking at my s22 plus with a beautiful, flat display with amazing form factor and a solid camera and i'm wondering if i should just get the s23 plus to get the better chip and battery life. someone sell me, haha. damn first world problems."

"are there galaxy s23 ultra 'must-use' features that i might have overlooked when i ported from my note 10? i've had a note 10 since about the time it released in 2019, and it finally bit the bullet and i upgraded to the s23 ultra (i can't live without an s-pen). when it got my new phone setup it ported over all the settings from my note 10 and all the apps, which was a wonderfully easy transition.

however, everything looks and feels more or less the same. that's fine, but i want to make sure i'm not missing anything. when i moved from the note 2 to a s8 edge, it added the edge panel which was annoying at first  but eventually grew on me.  then the note 10 added google assistant and some other features.  i never used bixby, but i know some people love it.

i want to make sure there aren't 'must use' features on the note 23 that i've overlooked by porting over my phone settings from the note 10.  i don't really live in the phone world in terms of new releases and things like that.  i just needed a phone and the s23 ultra came out at the right time.

so are there cool tricks, cool features, etc. that i need to make sure i'm not missing out on?  things that you've discovered on your new phones that made you say ""wow, i need to tell the world about how kick ass this is""?  i'd love to hear all of it so i can get the most use out of my new phone."
"smartthings/location+wifi scanning/modes and routines so i'm moving into the new age and i guess i'm questioning how things work when i switch to automations for home appliances/networking etc.

generally on my phone, i don't have bluetooth, wifi, or location enabled since they drain battery quite effectively. usually i'm rocking the mobile data *exclusively* since i'm on unlimited.only turn on location when using maps, and bluetooth works by itself when i use my earbuds.

what i want to do is have my phone switch networks when i'm in/out the house (using connect/disconnect from network as trigger) and turn off/reverse location and mobile data toggles. this i already have configured.

but here is the big question. in order to have this work autonomously, i'll probably need to have gps, bluetooth, wifi and mobile data all turned on when i'm outside... right?

i've noticed there are settings for certain apps pertaining location scanning (high and low precision) and also wifi/bluetooth scanning even if they're both turned off.

...how does this all mesh together? do i need to run bt/wifi/gps all day?   
because that's probably a deal-breaker.   
but if there's some automation i can write, or if low-usage background processes are adequate to determine my location for using smart home 'things', i'd love to know.

(on a side note; i'm getting a watch5lte as promotional gift, and i'd like to have find-my-phone services working optimally too. would that necessitate having these services on all day, or no?)  


thanks redditors! :)"
"hello everyone i have been researching for a lot but can't decide between the iphone 13(not pro max or pro) or the samsung s22 ultra i watched a lot of videos on both and a lot of comparisons and most of them contradict, in the future i will be getting a macbook for work if that matters for the apple ecosystem but can't i use samsung phone with a macbook just fine?, i'm just asking for some pros and cons, and most importantly how long each phone is gonna last, not as in battery life but as in dropping it on face side or scratching it etc."
"a52 5g to s23 base? hello everyone, i can clearly see the hardware difference between my current mid range device and the base s23 model but i'm really curious about the difference in experience. 

sure i have shitty haptics, unusable night photography, video and no good zoom and a few software hiccups here and there. 

even compared to a s22u my friend has though, i wouldn't say the experience was of a different world. night photography even though way better, it was still a smartphone photo and unusable other than to send to a friend. same with the display,  it's just a bit better than mine. performance difference i couldn't really tell other than the phone being a bit snappier. i suppose the s23 base model won't be that much better than the s22u. 

am i missing some aspect of the flagship experience?
i use my phone only for social, youtube and emails/browsing. and my latest flagship was the nexus 5 which i loved. 

just trying to figure out if 900-1000‚Ç¨ is worth the upgrade. (no trade in , or vendor deals available)"

"s21 ultra or s22 ultra 2nd hand hello, i've been looking to upgrade from my huawei p30 lite for some time and thse 2 phones are the main options(open to more), both of them 2nd  hand since in my country full price brand new cost almost as much as the new s23 ultra. s21 ultra is about 600 euros for the 256gb version and the s22 ultra is about 700 for the 128gb version. 

is the battery life on the s22 ultra exynos really that bad or even worse than the s21 ultra? this is my main reason for opting more for the s21 ultra instead of the s22 ultra.

i've read lots of opinions and experiences but i wanted to ask the question myself.

i'm looking to hold onto this phone for a year or so until the next iphone / s24 ultra is released and then decide on one of the best phones.

for now i just want to get rid of this huawei since its barely working anymore."

i hadn't really seen anyone post any sort of comparisons around this setting yet. while waiting in a line there was a dog wagging its tail at a pretty constant speed so i got to test if the capture speed setting does anything to minimize the motion blur problem. if anything the blur looks a litter worse to me under prioritize speed, but i think that's just from the dog being a bit closer. either way, it absolutely does not improve the issue significantly.

"samsung shop (india) really messed up my order! so i pre-ordered the s23 ultra along with the grip case, watch 5 pro, buds 2 pro and screen protector on 5th. the watch 5 pro had a delivery date of 7th feb. i scheduled the buds 2 pro to deliver on 16th feb. other items being a pre-order, it was expected to start shipping from 17th feb. weird thing about the case and the screen protector was that it's shipping was to start from 17th but delivery date was for 16th!!

so here's the day by day timeline so far on what followed.
7th feb - as expected the watch 5 pro got delivered. i didn't have an android at the time to set it up since i was still in the iphone.

16th feb - my buds 2 pro was supposed to be shipped by now and it was still showing confirmed on the app. whole day passed and they were not delivered.

17th feb - my s23 ultra got shipped with a delivery date for 18th. but the grip case and screen protector were still not packed. same case with the buds as well. i called up samsung to enquire and they assured it will be delivered on 18th.

18th feb - got my phone and i was super excited. the whole day went in setting up the phone. during the later half i checked the app for status on the remaining 3 items and they were still not packed. i called up samsung again and now they were telling they will register a complaint. i told the guy why was a wrong commitment given and they had no answer. they told me it would be sorted it 24hrs. since i didn't have a case, i ordered a ringke case from amazon
 
19th feb - same status of order not packed. i got my ringke case though.
 
20th feb - i called up samsung again and they telling their teams weren't working on sunday so nobody was able to look at the issue.

21st feb - samsung finally started packing the order but split them into 3 different shipments.

22nd feb - recieved the grip case and screen protector. yet to receive the buds since it's delivery date is 23rd.

i think samsung forgot to place the order till i escalated to their support since i got no communication from them even if there was a delay. samsung didn't even have the courtesy to do that. the invoice dates found in my screen protector and case box are dated on 21st feb which means i dont think they have accounted for the pre-orders properly. overall a super disappointing first experience with samsung shop."

recently i was in a hotel that provided a tablet in each room. out of curiosity i plugged in the charging cable. instant reliable fast charging. i has also noticed a phone shop that sold ""charging cable"". tried his cable and also instant fast charging. bought it and had him dispose of my ""original samsung cable""

i guess samsung designed the s8 too perfectly so any mechanical aberration made the cable longer fit. and since cable have been designed with a slightly shorter connector si they fit anyway?"

"45w samsung charger (t4510xbegus vs ep-ta845xbegus) edit: update! i received my 45w charger today and started charging with my s23u turned off at 4%. reached 100% within 35 minutes. :) very happy with the results.

just wanted to point out that the samsung 45w charger ([ep-t4510xbegus](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/45w-power-adapter-with-cable-ep-t4510xbegus/)) is very effective compared to the previous samsung 45w charger (ep-ta845xbegus).

the first was released in 2022 and is able to charge the s23u from 0-100% in under an hour. the second was released in 2019 and is the charger that is barely better than the 25w charger.

i'm posting this because i couldn't understand the difference between the two chargers on samsung's site, had to look on amazon to confirm, and felt like y'all could benefit from my findings. also, both were sold out during the pre-order period. so! make sure to get the ep-t4510xbegus version if you live in the us and buy one."

"s-pen latency over time: have you noticed it? for curiosity sake, i wanted to know how much of an effect the latency of the s-pen actually has on usability and the perception of smoothness and ""instantness"". the current s-pen technology has a latency of the 2.8ms, as found on the s23 ultra, the s22 ultra, tab s8+ and tab s8 ultra. the previous latency values before that were 26ms, as found on the note 20, and 9ms, as found on the note 20 ultra and tab s7+. prior to that, it was significantly higher at 45ms on devices like the note 10. 

so, here's my question: users who've used either the note/s ultra series from at least the note 10 series to the s22 or s23 ultra, or the tab s6 to the tab s8 plus or ultra, have you noticed a difference in the latency reduction over time? is the reduction from 45ms to 26ms to 9ms and now 2.8ms actually noticable? or is it just a nice thing to have/marketing fluff for what was already fine? 

i'm not looking to gripe on samsung; i'm just curious about how much users actually notice the improvements when it's measured in thousandths of a second. 

thanks!"
"i've bought a leather case for my s23 ultra in bellroy and super disappoint the texture is bad. just like a plastic case stick with a fake leather skin. also the smell is very bad.
totally disappointed"
"magsafe case recommendation - thin as possible - 23u hi, 

i'm looking case with magsafe so i can attach finger ring. i never ever have any case on my phones so i'm completely beginner in this case world... thing is that 23u is little to big to comfortable hold it in one hand for me... so i'm looking case with magsafe but as thin as possible. i was found some silicone with this feature but mostly non brand or brands that i never heard before so do not know if i will waste my money. any one maybe use one and can help?"
"looking forward to purchase a new product hi everyone! i have a galaxy a53 and want to purchase another samsung product. i would love a new pair of galaxy buds, but i have some third-party ones or should i buy a samsung watch?

"any opinions on the samsung galaxy book3 ultra? i currently am using a samsung galaxy book flex 15.6 (2020 model), and i have really enjoyed using this laptop for the last 2.5 years except for its 12 gb of limited ram and the 1080 display is good but not exceptional. 

i was looking at the galaxy book3 ultra for its 32 gb of ram but what really put me off is not only the lack of a s pen (that one i could probably do without) but no touch screen at all? how does a $2000+ flagship laptop not even have a touch screen? 

looking for opinions on anyone who has a galaxy book3 ultra if you thought its worth the up to 3000 price tag? thank you!"

"next s23u sale opportunity? i got the s23u during preorder and have been so impressed by it that a family member is also looking to make the switch. anyone have any historical insight as to when samsung may run comparable deals to the preorder (512gb for price of 256, etc.) once the phone is already out?"

"a53 call volume deafening my a53 loves to deafen me. i'll answer the phone and the volume is low. i'll put it to my ear and the volume goes to max. every time. a normal call goes: call starts, i put it to my ear, pull it away, set the volume, and then resume the call. it's ridiculous, and i've not seen any options or even anyone discussing it. every discussion i've found is just, ""my call volume is too low"", ""it's suddenly quieter, blah blah"". i wish.

does anyone else's phone do this?"

black line down the crease and no touch screen functionality after 5 months of ownership. way to go samsung :) i understand that there is a 1 year warranty but that shouldn't take away from the fact that this shouldn't be happening. i baby this phone and i haven't dropped it ever so who knows what caused it. do better samsung.
battery charge to 85% for longer battery life anyone charge to only 85% for better battery life? i have the basic s23 and on some forums it is suggested to use the setting to only charge to 85% for extra long term battery life..thanks
"smart switch killing the battery interested if we could see how many people had issues with this and if we could ever see an official response 

i posted yesterday that i had some crap battery life and people were recommending i do a manual setup instead of smart switch and i don't know what sorcery it is but it seems to work

yesterday - 13h 26m used, 2h sot and 11 mins of gaming  - 54%

after resetting and manual setup with my same apps 

18h 56m, 1.5hr sot and 15 mins of gaming - 82%

both had almost no 5g either was at work or at home 95% of the time for both usages

i realise this is anecdotal but it does appear to have some  weight behind it"
"in your opinion how much is the camera worth in the s23 ultra? if you could name a price.  how much would you pay if you just planned on using the s23 ultra as a camera for the most part?   $400, $500, $600?"

"thinking of switching to s23 ultra (lifetime iphone user) hey guys and girls, you probably get so many of these posts but i thought i would post as i'm at a big crossroads for myself.

i'm a lifelong apple user, iphone 14 pro max, airpods pro/ max, airtags, apple watch ultra and the list goes on. but the problem is i'm just bored, it works, it all works seamlessly with little problems but at the same time with no excitement anymore, and as someone who loves tech and new features apple just isn't doing anything innovative for me.

i tried the s22 ultra when it came out last year along with the watch 4 classic and i did really like them but i was so far into the apple ecosystem that everything just felt odd and eventually i changed back. now the s23 range is out and my head won't let me go 5 mins without thinking about switching.

but if i'm truly honest with you l'm slightly afraid to do so. my entire family is apple and imessage is just so easy, i use facetime for weekly calls and airpods max are the only headphones l've found that both look good on me and actually sound good with best in class nc and transparency mode. also the apple watch ultra is something i couldn't live without, i hated apple watch before the ultra came out due to battery, but the battery life and water resistance as well as (in my opinion) best interface on a smart watch is just great for me.

even with all this though i still want to switch, from people with experience of just the s22/23 ultra or of both apple and samsung, could you give me some suggestions on how to make the transition easier or benefits of doing so. i know i could still use my airpods max but does anyone have any problems using them with android? same with the watch 5 pro. how does it compare to the ultra? i've watched countless videos on the matter but i always find that youtubers perspectives are a little biased and usually not as extensive as a full time user of the products.

again i know people probably see this a fair amount on the subreddit and feel free to tell me if this post isn't allowed but some actual user reviews and tips would be really helpful."

"exynos processors now that we can almost say samsung got rid of the exynos processors (or at least for a while), i have a question for you.

have you ever had an exynos processor? and if yes, how was the experience? was it that bad like some people say? 

i've never had one but i think sometimes people tend to exaggerate about this topic.

what do you think?"
"lagging issues with instagram and tiktok videos on galaxy s22 exynos hi guys!

i have a problem that i haven't been familiar with other phones, and i cannot handle that anymore. so the problem is when the screen refresh rate is set to 120 hz, i find some lags on instagram and tiktok videos, but when i set that to 60 hz, it seems normal. i thought that the latest update (5.1) would solve this stuff, but it disappointed me. it is something due to firmware, or just an another exynos 2200 issue? looking for the right answears."
"swiftkey has no app icon and can be disabled i'm using a samsung s22 ultra and there's an option to disable swiftkey - not an option to deinstall it. also theres no app icon for the swiftkey keyboard anymore, i have to find it through the keyboards or when swiftkey is open - settings. i've installed the swiftkey keyboard, it hasn't been pre-installed. why is this the case? i know i can uninstall in through the play store."
"screen repair type and deals? i have seen in the past about screen repair deals for $99. my wife has broken her screen and would wait to fix for a little time if the deal is coming soon. does it historically happen at same time each year or does someone in the know, know?
also, on the samsung screen repair cost page has two types of fixes. they list screen module replacement and screen repair. does one have to pay for both or one or the other? what is what here?"
"multi window on one side is anybody using onehand operation +? since oneui 5 when using it from a full screen, i have a gesture swipe to open multiwondow on both sides and when i do it from the full screen for example youtube videoplayer - camera for test, it opens normally as it should that first app in the top window if the phone is turned in: horizontal, camera is on the left and bottom on the right. if it's in the other side: horizontal, camera is on the right and bottom is on the left, it opens the full screen in the open window for some reason. makes no sense. anybody else has this strange issue?"
"s23u fingerprint scanner is horrible compared to my previous s20 fe i keep on having to scan multiple times for the fingerprint scanner to work. i never had this issue with the s20 fe. is the fingerprint scanner different or is the phone bigger than what my hand is used to?

edit: i think the s20 fe was more forgiving when you scanned your fingerprint diagonally. the s23u is still fast if you position your fingerprint perfectly, but it's a lot less forgiving if you don't. 

also, i haven't used any screen protectors. "
"what does s23 ultra use its peak brightness for? the website says it has a peak brightness of 1750 nits but it only goes up to 1200 nits for hdr. if not in hdr, where is the peak brightness used then?"
"s23u is much snappier than s22u i recently upgraded from a note 10 to the s22u (8gb snapdragon), and while the camera improvements were great, everything else was underwhelming. the device still felt slower than what i expected from a recent flagship.

the jump from s22u to s23u (12gb) is enormous. everything is faster. it feels like a powerful machine. this is what i wanted from a smartphone."
"s23+ screen on vs screen off with notifications (with animation) i'm wondering if having my screen off and allowing notifications (with animation) use more battery then having screen fully on? do the animations use a lot of battery? 

&#x200b;

for more context i noticed while using google maps for navigation with screen off, it will show notifications on screen for each turn, etc. then it will go back to screen being fully off. does this use comparable amounts of battery as just having the screen on?"
"while the s22u's battery sucks, i've been getting all-day battery life on battery-saver mode. it honestly sucks that i'm running a $1200+ smartphone on battery saver all the time but i've found this to be the only way to get a reliable full day's worth of battery life. as someone who uses their phone primarily for calls, social, and whatsapp i have no complaints with battery saver mode as i see no performance dips for my usage.

the phone is almost unusable for me on regular mode as it becomes the usian bolt of battery drain. i know it's a dead horse but samsung really dropped the ball with the sdg1 and i can't help but feel we all got a bit stiffed.

tl;dr - getting allday battery life on my s22u on battery saver, it's a dumpster fire without it."
does 1tb version for s23 ultra has or ever goes on sale? hey everyone i'm just wondering if 1tb version for s23 ultra has or will go on sale? a friend told me that he bought 512gb for price of 256gb but what about 1tb one?  i'm new to samsung phones in general so i'm not familiar with samsung discounts and promotions. thanks everyone!

"galaxy s22 ultra - screen protector do you use a screen protector on your s22 ultra? if yes, which one?"
"samsung galaxy s23+ touch sensitivity. hey all.

i just got my samsung galaxy s23+ a couple of days ago coming from a oneplus 6t. i put a spigen glass screen protector on it the moment i took it out of the box before turning it on. this is the first samsung phone i've had since the galaxy s6.

and something is really killing the experience for me. the touch sensitivity. it feels so unresponsive. i find that swiping left and right feels slow and swiping up and down feels like it's dragging. the oneplus felt so fluid and smooth but this takes a lot of effort to scroll having to put much more pressure and drag further to make it move. even then sometimes it barely scrolls and sometimes misses my touch at all. it seems so inconsistent. and i've turned on the setting for increased sensitivity for screen protectors. 

is anyone else noticing this or just me? it feels awful and honestly i'm thinking of sending it back and getting a new oneplus. it just ruins the experience.

also the settings are a mess in comparison. so many things i've had to search the internet to find because of it and some things just seem not as good. the op has much more customization for a start. and a lot of things in oneui feels counter intuitive.

does anyone know if the notification tone and sms tone can be separate? if so i haven't found it. i prefer the app and sms tone to have separate sounds? does anyone know if it can be done? it's stupid if not. no custom accent colours either which is stupid, just basic ones. on op i could customise it at an rgb colour code level.

also does anyone know if the auto play for videos can be turned off for the gallery?

thank you all for reading and thank you in advance for comments and assistance. my main thing here that's driving me mad is the sensitivity and responsiveness.

edit: so to all the folks suggesting it's likely the screen protector, i removed it and tried using the phone without it. no noticeable difference. oneui just feels clunky compared to what i'm used to and the fingerprint scanner never recognises mine first time despite re-registering it. unless i press down harder than i'm used to and a good amount of pressure at that. i guess i'm quite unhappy with the samsung which feels overpriced for the experience."

"s22u battery life after 1 year purchase. seeing everyone celebrate the s23 has me puzzled. https://imgur.com/a/qtbqoim

this is a casual everyday thing. i've been *listening* to netflix instead of radio/audio books lately at work 

unplug my phone at ~5am, and it gets plugged in about ~7pm and usually never under 20%, want to say 30% is average. all on cellular signal. 

so 14ish hours and never need to stress about recharge all day. love it.

"integrate wear os / tizen into routines and modes? as a type 1 diabetic, being able to use my smart devices to alert myself and family members that my levels are starting to go low (particularly at night) is great.

as i wear a glucose sensor on my arm, i would like to set up a routine at night whereby when my monitor app sends a specific notification to my phone, i want my watch to vibrate continuously so that i wake up.

currently i am using ifttt to do something similar but with my hue lights. however this isn't ideal as my wife doesn't want a midnight disco everytime i am in need of a chocolate biscuit.

is this integration something in the works?"

"watched a youtube video on samsung+dolby atmos, but dolby atmos made it sound worse if you got a samsung phone with dolby atmos mode and headphones handy, i suggest that you try it out: https://youtu.be/-cartvtysku

this is a demo by samsung of their collaboration with dolby.

i listened to it with my headphones on and went back and forth, turning dolby atmos on and off.

dolby atmos-mode takes away from the surround sound experience. the clarity is nice tho.

do you guys just leave dolby atmos on/off?"
"finally got my book 3 ultra! some performance notes. i put together my thoughts so far here since i did not see much about the performance and battery life online yet. the laptop has been pretty decent to use, i was looking for a laptop that can handle a decent bit of gaming but also has a good battery life and is portable, this seems to work so far.

## build quality / overall thoughts

personally, i feel the build quality is good. i noticed a bit of screen wobble and the screen is super reflective. having a numpad felt a bit weird in terms of positioning my hands. this is the first time i have thought that a trackpad can be ""too big"", i felt the keyboard was so far away sometimes, lol. the keys are also a bit shallow. but i did find myself getting used to these quirks over time.

## performance

i was a bit disappointed to hear the fans running loud when playing a game or when running benchmarks but the game performance was not even close to what i was expecting from a 4070 (even though it runs at such a low wattage). that was until i switched on the high performance mode in ""samsung settings"" app (it was already in high performance mode in windows battery settings), the performance was so much better after that! i only tested dota 2 so far, i went from \~55-60 fps to 100+ fps with max settings in native resolution. time spy scores: [https://imgur.com/a/iy7z7xb](https://imgur.com/a/iy7z7xb)

## battery life

i have been playing with the laptop just for a few hours now, so i do not have any solid numbers. i saw \~35% decrease in battery when using it for 2 hours at half screen brightness, on the quiet performance preset in samsung settings, adaptive refresh rate enabled, a second screen connected via superdisplay, have 15-20 chrome tabs open and playing videos constantly. i would estimate the battery life to be around 5.5 to 8 hours for medium to light use.

## pros, cons and final thoughts

* pros
   * display. can't think of a better looking display, oled looks so beautiful and 120 hz looks plenty smooth
   * form factor. pretty light for a (3.95lb/1.8kg) for a 16 inch laptop and pretty thin as well
   * performance. i would list this as a pro if i am not considering the price, the laptop is plenty capable, but a proper gaming laptop would have a way better performance (probably at the cost of battery life and/or good form factor)
* cons
   * price. the 'i9 processor' and 'rtx 4070' seems to be contributing more to the price than the performance imo.
   * keyboard. the lack of a good key travel, the number pad making the overall layout awkward, the weirdly positioned arrow keys do leave quite a bit of room for improvement in this area.
   * speakers. really? bottom facing speakers in 2023 on a $3k laptop? having such a nice display makes this even more painful for me personally. but overall not too bad.

the screen just might be what makes me keeps this laptop. let me know if you like to know something about the laptop or if there are things you want me to run on this laptop."
"how could samsung improve the buds2 pro? i just recently got the buds2 pro after my buds pro case broke (way too early imo). they address every flaw i had with the buds pro. the slippery case is now grippy. the fit is amazing. i sometimes even forget that they are in. the sound is also amazing, as always. so what could they improve with the buds3 pro? slightly better noise canceling wouldn't be good enough for a whole new generation, and on the shape/case/responsiveness, they can't improve anymore. what do you think they are/could be working on?"

"the s22 ultra round sides was so much better just got my s23 ultra today and kinda disappointed by the feel in the hand. youtubers convinced me it felt nicer with the flatter sides.

but when i hold both together, the s22u is way more ergonomic. its not even close. the round aluminum just sinks into the skin between your thumb and index finger. the s23u just feels ""alright"". its not bad but it isn't amazing like before. maybe i just have soft hands so i notice these things.

i admit the s23u does feel more like a brick which is cool in a premium kinda way. i can under why people would prefer it.

( i know the s23 is the far superior phone, this is only talking about ergonomics)"
"finally, i got a samsung....again after some painful months with an iphone (when i say painful i really mean it) i managed to get a samsung galaxy s20 fe snapdragon, yes i know it isn't a new 2023 phone with bla bla bla and hundreds of megapixels but i just don't care about this camera and stuff, overall i just fell in love with it, sincerely one of the best phones i ever had, and i'm happy to have a samsung again. 

i hope no mean users start complaining about why i didn't spent thousands of dollars on a flagship phone that does bla bla bla, because for me it's just a phone, it just got to do what i need it to.


edit: for everyone asking what was my problem with the iphone:

i bought the iphone to try it out again after some long years of not having one, but the phone every time started to get really hot in a point that i had to use a fan to continue to use it, the battery lasted 3 hours even tho the phone was basically turned off the hole time, the phone started glitching right after i downloaded the ios 16, like the screen suddently started to have ghost touch, i even changed the screen but no success."
"is there an easy way to keep two phones up to date with texts? i want to switch back and forth between s23u and fold 4 and move the sim card but want to have all my texts on both phones no matter which one i grab.  especially since i might use the fold 4 much more so when i do grab the s23u i want to just grab and go and have the info and not wait for anything to dl.   i am on verizon. 

thanks"

"s23 ultra battery life question i remember hearing someone talking about the best way to keep the battery long lasting. something about do not let it die and keeping the battery between 15% and 85%.

is this accurate? if not what do you recommend?"
low light comparison 
"is the s23 ultra seriously that much more scratch prone than past devices (like the s22u)? never have used a screen protector before. i've been using smartphones since the original g1 and i've never used a screen protector. no cracks from drops, and no unreasonable scratches other than the micro scratches accumulated from general use. i'm looking at my s9+ that i used for like 4 years with no protector and it looks fine to me still. little cuts here and there, nothing that i'd actually notice in general use.

now i'm hearing that the s23u is so incredibly scratch prone that a screen protector is mandatory? is it *really*? like i understand micro scratches, they happen over time and it's whatever, but people are making this sound like something new. like the scratchpocalypse.

i like cases, always use one, but screen protectors always struck me as a hassle, and i'm having a hard time finding one i can use with the case i've already ordered. whichever one i check it's either the thing bubbles a lot, doesn't work with cases, or ruins the fingerprint sensor (which i use a lot). i'd be willing to pay a lot for a perfect screen protector, but it doesn't seem to exist, so i'm rapidly leaning into skipping it altogether.

basically, i'm asking if just using this thing without a protector will eventually result in a nigh unusable screen, or if we're just talking about the sort of thing that would bother a person examining the screen from the right angle with some light and a microscope? is it noticeably worse than something like an s9+ or even the s22 ultra in terms of scratch resistance?"
"how i got a factory unlocked s23 ultra for $306 first off, i always buy my phones outright, factory unlocked so they don't have specific carrier branding or carrier bloatware.  i then use them with a good reputable mvno for about half the monthly cost of a service plan from a major carrier with the only downside being slower speed when you're around thousands of other people like in a stadium.

the carriers entice people with shiny new objects with gazillion dollars off deals because (a) they know the majority of consumers can't afford to buy the phone outright and (b) they make the big discount a monthly credit spread over 24-36 months so unless you have 3 or 4 lines with the carrier, you will be paying out the nose for the service which is where they make their profit so they can afford to give you low payments on the phone.  try to leave before the 24-36 months and you have to give the phone back or pay it off and lose the remaining credits from the discount.

google fi and spectrum have the best deals. google fi is more straight forward though. $600 off the phone at purchase and you just have to stay with them 120 days (google fi is a t-mobile mvno and also uses us cellular towers when it makes sense.)  spectrum is convoluted about getting your money back (there's debate whether it's a service credit that they'll refund the unused portion of if you leave them after 60 days or a visa cash card 2 months later or whatever. and you'll get a spectrum branded phone.

at samsung store, the pre-order deal cost with trading in my note 20 ultra was $807 including a $46 additional educational discount which pretty much anyone can get. pass. (almost forgot, they also threw in for note 20 trades a free watch that you could net about $125 for on ebay, so technically net would have been around $680.)

google fi, the phone was an instant $600 off or $599 ($649 with tax) 512gb model.  the monthly plan is, with a coupon for a $20 credit, a total of $60 more over the minimum 4 months than the comparable us mobile plan i use.  so that's a total cost of $709.  the big catch is my note 20 ultra is mint condition. sold it for $483.33 on ebay.  net after ebay fees and shipping cost is $403.  so the net cost on upgrading to the s23 ultra is $306.  and the best thing is i'm not stuck with a specific carrier branded phone (so it will have better resale value) and don't have to pay for a $40-$70 overpriced plan at verizon, t-mobile, or at&t for 2-3 years (i use no more than 10gb a month so a $20 15gb plan for a verizon mvno suits me great. coverage is the same, speeds always adequate(even \*real\* high-speed 5g supported not basically relabeled 4g lte speed all the time) and great customer service.)"
"anyone had bubbles on their s23? my base s23 has a bubble in the screen, any ideas? i was looking at my new s23 that i've had for 2 weeks now, i noticed a bubble on the screen despite not having brought nor applied any protector myself, i was wondering whether this came with the phone and whether i can then remove that? and whether this is not the case, than what's going on with that?"
"are phone mounts on cars, motorcycles and bicycles safe? i know specifically that mounting a phone on a motorcycle with the vibration can damage the phone. i was thinking about getting a bicycle mount for my s23 ultra from peak design but i heard the same thing.

"s23 ultra terrible battery! i have had my s23 ultra for a few weeks now and the battery life is absolutely nothing short of abysmal. i can only get a maximum of 4hrs of sot, which is ridiculous for this flagship given the price i paid and that others are getting 8-9-10hrs sot. it drains 1% for like every few minutes of usage.

i previously used smart switch to transfer from my s21+ and after reading that it can potentially cause battery drain i factory reset the phone. nothing changed. here are my settings:

- 120hz wqhd+
- mix of wifi 6 and lte 4g (no 5g, good signal in my area)
- brightness around 40%
- bluetooth on (galaxy watch 4)
- protect battery (only charge to 85%)

i have a bixby routine set up to turn off wifi, mobile data, bluetooth and turn on airplane mode and battery saver, yet it still drains like 4-5% overnight. i can't imagine how much it will drain without that... i am 100% confident i have no rogue apps draining my battery.

coming from an s21+ (was getting 2h sot, the only reason i upgraded was the battery life...) this feels like i got scammed by samsung yet again. do i have the shittiest luck in the universe or is samsung fundamentally bad? 

i apologize for the long rant and i'd really like some insight here because i am understandably pissed off when others are getting such crazy battery life.

"galaxy s10+ vs a52s 5g in 2023  hey guys

i own a xiaomi redmi note 9 pro since 2020. this phone was great in performance and especially battery life, but unfortunately i've been having really bad ghost touch issues with it since 1.5 years ago with other issues as well. with that said i'm trying to avoid xiaomi entirely.

i kept looking for a another midrange phone. galaxy a73 was too expensive where i live (510$), and i heard about performance issues about the a53 so it didn't really convince me.

i decided in the end to pick the a52s 5g, only to be given a used galaxy s10+ (exynos) as a gift recently. i like the s10+'s screen and build material and also it's quite fast. but i tested its battery capacity with accubattery and it gave me 85% (3500 mah) so i'm having doubts about its longevity.

i'm currently deciding whether i should stick with the galaxy s10+ (exynos) ? or sell it and buy the a52s 5g ? i don't really care about updates unless they actually correct big issues with the os, and i mainly use my phone to watch youtube, take notes and take calls. and i could really use a good battery life like the note 9 pro's and a bright screen outdoors especially when i'm traveling.

what do you guys think is the best decision ?"
"which of the cases offer raised edges higher than the curved screen to protect the s23 ultra? i only bought the spigen neo-hybrid case and it offers very minimal protection for the curved screen of the s23 ultra. then i bought the incipio duo case which i previously used for the s10+ but side of the case was significantly lower than the curved screen. i'm also not in the market for a bulky af case like otterbox or armadillotek just for the side protection of the case. 

so far in my amzn cart, i have the ghostek covert and the esr shock armor kickstand case. anyone who have these for their s23u, can confirm that the sides of the case are raised higher than the curved screen to give the phone a chance to survive a drop?"

"first time having a bad trade-in experience with samsung i pre-ordered the s23 ultra putting my s22 ultra up for trade-in. the s22 ultra only has minor cosmetic damage. the reason for the trade-in is my battery is terrible for some reason; it doesn't last a work day. 

i got the s23 ultra and sent in my s22 u. about a week later, i receive an email from samsung that the s22 u was ineligible for full credit because the body or screen was cracked. knowing the device was in very good condition when i sent it to them, i opted to have them return it instead of accepting $150 or so in credit for the device. 

after i chose to have it returned, i called samsung's customer service to find out if there would be any options available to me if the phone does come back to me cracked or otherwise damaged and all i had for proof was my story vs theirs. the customer rep was super helpful. apparently they make video recordings for their ""triage reports"" (or something) so he was able to find video evidence that my phone was not damaged. that was a relief. he offered me a $50 code to be emailed to me for all the trouble; the email never arrived. 

a few days later, i receive my s22 u and it's in the same condition i sent it out. except! samsung took my s pen. i am sorry i did not make any video recordings of the device i was going to trade in. i had grown confident in the samsung trade-in process as i've been trading in my old devices yearly since the note8. i will call them again to see if they'll do anything about this.

"2023 over the horizon collection i was sad to see that the over the horizon songs have not been released for download or streaming officially. while there are youtube videos, these are compressed and some even have parts of the music cut off. so i decided to gather them all and share.

for the uninitiated, 'over the horizon' is the samsung galaxy theme song. the first version was released with the galaxy s2 in 2011. every year samsung refreshes the song and bundles it with their galaxy devices from that year.

these are sourced from the original files that are shipped with the devices. however, i have modified the file names and tags to correct some mistakes and keep everything consistent. the collection of songs, ringtones, and media previews can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1njdbpqm7nukoqf5epwkskjzjtl4fyxxi?usp=sharing).

note that i have converted non-mp3 files to mp3 so that all the files can be easily opened and used. also, for ringtones starting from the galaxy s22 and later, i have edited the tracks to remove the third channel that is used to sync the haptic motor feedback with the track. if you want the original files, they are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/xdd4g7/samsung_galaxy_audio_library_alarms_notifications/).

"samsung s23 ultra 8gb ram vs 12gb ram  

hi guys,

i want to buy a samsung s23 ultra but only the 8gb ram variant is in stock where i live. i don't really game on my phone, just scroll a lot of youtube and maybe some movies on plex, but have a lot of tabs opened in chrome (not sure if those take up a lot of ram, while they're not displayed).

so i don't think i'm an extreme power user.

the 256 gb storage seems more than enough for my needs, i have the same on my current phone and i've never had the need to clean the space even once in 4 years.

my question is this:

is 8 gb still okay to get as the 256 is exactly what i want, or should i wait for the 12gb ram variants to be back in stock?

is ram much more important in 2023?

&#x200b;

i don't mind to have only 2-3 apps in memory before they close, what i don't want, is for the phone not not be as snappy next year, because of the lack of ram.

thanks!"
"psa: if your speakers are sounding crackled and/or distorted and rebooting isn't fixing it, open and close the sim card slot. was going crazy with my a52s because sometimes audio would just be completely screwed and within a few hours the problem would go away, but not immediately (so phone calls would be impossible unless i used headphones). went to samsung tech service about 5 times, no fix.

last visit was a miracle. tech told me this happens on several samsung smartphones including some s series when the atmospheric pressure inside the phone is different from the outside environment. just open the sim slot, let it equalize, and close it again. fixed.

just happened to me after a flight. sat down, did this and within 20 seconds it was perfect again."
"some grievances switching from pixel 7 pro to the s23 ultra first off, i do like the overall experience - especially from the hardware side. the phone just feels way more premium. (as it should considering the price difference)

-

**still there are a few minor things that annoy me:**

* volume buttons - this actually surprised me because when i first got the pixel i thought the placement was weird but over time it grew on me, it feels more natural now

**oneui:**

* folders - they just feel more thought through on the pixel, you can open and select the app you want with one hand instead with oneui you must either shift the phone or use both hands (there is a setting in homeup on goodlock but the folder opening animation takes forever so it‚Äôs not usable in my opinion)
* app drawer - there is no option to focus the search bar automatically
* app drawer - no *real* app list (there is a setting on homeup but then you have ""priority apps"" pinned on top which makes the whole thing unusable)
* quick panel - the settings and power icons being at the bottom on the pixel makes quickly accessing them so much more convenient

looking at the list - most of the ""issues"" could be solved by switching to a different launcher but for such an expensive phone i expect them to do better"

"astro mode has some loose ends so i've been using the astro mode the last couple days and it is awesome, but of course, some things could be improved (or maybe i'm using it wrong?;


-s-pen shutter in expert raw. i know using a 2sec timer works too, but it's not the same.

-screen preview i think it's called in real cameras. 
where if you're busy focusing, the screen will completely zoom in on a tiny part of your live screen preview so you can check the focus.

usually things are very dark in your preview while astro shooting, so it helps being able to pick a random star and use that to focus on. 
because of the lens switching i assume it's a fruitless effort to actually zoom in and focus. and then zoom back out. 

focus peaking is nice but i'd rather preview it myself. moon shots already prompt this same sort of preview when stabilising at 100x (in the camera app, not expert raw).


-the constellation overlay is cool but every time i've used it, it was off a fair bit. and when i saw some galaxy i could potentially zoom in on (i know) like m44 or something.. that's when i remember finding it while zooming in is going to be hell.


-the 4/7/10 min exposure feature may be broken. not sure what happens but instead of one 7min exposure, tonight i notificed it gave me two 3,5min exposures. so 2 raw files and 2 jpegs. i do remember it's not the first time i've heard this.

also took a 10min exposure and as far as exif data goes, that shot doesn't exist. 

could all be due to built-in overexposure protection or something like it, but maybe it's actually buggy. 

hope samsung reads this! awesome phone. swiss army knife of phones."
"calling all routine users: is there any way to have phone charge if battery is below a certain % only, and not stop until it hits the protect battery (85%)  

i hate that protect battery puts the phone back on charge as soon as it drops to 84% after reaching 85%, the defined protect battery threshold.

got a routine set up for the daytime to enable battery protect if placed on a charger during certain hours (11am - 3am). i'll never need 100% charge after a certain time, so getting to 85% is fine after 11am.

what i'm trying to do now is set up 2 routines.

**routine 1** is simple: enable protect battery during certain hours (11am - 3am).

routine 2 - i don't think i can do it, but maybe i'm missing something obvious? i've written how i want it to work:

**routine 2 - check if phone battery is low enough to charge**

* if phone placed on a wireless charger, check battery level  

   * if battery level above / = x (say 65%), then  

      * don't charge
   * if battery level below x (say 65%)  

      * charge (phone will charge to 85% due to protect battery = true)
   * if battery level ***drops*** below x  

      * charge (phone will charge to 85% due to protect battery = true)

the idea - when wireless charging: to have the phone not charge to 85%, stop, fall to 84%, start charging to 85%.... repeat cycle...

instead, i'd like to charge to 85%, then not have the phone charge again until it falls below 65%. it sounds super simple so i'm convinced i'm just being stupid."

"fraudulent and no responsibility taken. beyond disappointed and shocked. hi people,

i've posted this on samsung forums but just wanted to share my experience here.

so i've been buying from samsung since the s4 line years and years ago. however, this is the first time i purchased from the official site. i bought the s23 during pre-order and used the trade-in program, but what happened over 2-3 weeks has completely made me lose faith and trust in samsung. i will never buy a phone from them again.

i ordered the s23 ultra 512gb in cream with some phone accessories from the e-voucher.¬†**au230202-38617344** was¬†my order number and i was stoked to see what samsung had to offer. when i received it, turns out the side of the phone became a little scuffed and i asked for an exchange. the agent was kind enough and assured me the replacement process has been arranged. all i had to do is wait for the return label to be emailed and send it in.¬†

now i don't know why a return label took almost a week to be sent, but it did on an afternoon and i sent it in as swiftly as i could. both the s23 ultra and the a52s was mailed off, and i kept the tracking numbers.

the week after on a wednesday, i got an email saying the refund has been completed. ??? i realized there must've been a mistake somewhere and contacted samsung's live chat pronto. i asked for a replacement, not a refund, and the agent before also reassured me. the agent this time investigated the situation and acknowledged that they can see the refund request was clear, but their back offices marked it as 'lost in transit' and subsequently refunded me for it. keep in mind both the phones showed up as 'delivered' on my auspost tracking.¬†

i have asked multiple times for assistance, over live chat and live call, but none of the representatives had the authority to actually do anything about it, since the order is now ""complete"". they sent my case over to their 'voc', whatever that is, and a week later today there is still no contact.¬†

i'm just beyond distressed and disappointed at this moment. i've lost 2 phones, 2-3 weeks of my time, and work opportunities. such a big company and they had nothing to offer - no direct contact with their higher-ups, no ramification, and no adequate processes and quality checks in place to prevent incidents like this. i'd buy it again but, i am not paying $2,2k\~ to cover their mistakes and negligence when i paid $1569 rightfully during the pre-order. samsung couldn't even offer me a voucher code to let me buy it again.

i don't even have a phone to use now, and it's thanks to me believing in samsung in the first place. again, i just have no words for samsung's appalling processes and their negligence to customers. i don't want to ever buy from samsung again, and this is just the experience i wanted to share.

so has anyone actually experienced subpar customer service and order negligence like this?? i'd be keen to hear people's thoughts. i'm also planning to buy the iphone 15 ultra. seriously screw samsung. they also need to give me my crappy a52s back.

thanks.

**update:** 

i received a call today, 3rd of feb at 12:22pm. i assume it was from one of the many follow ups the samsung reps raised for me. the agents messed it up again. 

he said, ""regarding the refund request raised for your phone, we just want to confirm if you have received it? yes? okay thank you!"" üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è i intervened and complained that yes, i received the refund but that was not the point of this case at all. i never specifically asked for the refund and only ever wanted an exchange. so he ""changed his notes"" and said ""someone will be in contact with you asap"". no estimated date."

now i have ordered from samsung and am waiting for a product however, i get tons of delivery notification scams and am wise enough to initiate a chat with support.

where i'm told not only can they not verify for me that they sent a message but that if i want to set a new requested date i'd need to click the link in the sms provided.

given the prominence of phishing scams and cyber crime in 2023 this is totally unacceptable.there's nothing in the message that can be used to verify it's legit and support can't or wont confirm that samsung sent it and it's legit while telling me the only way to actually get confirmation and book a new date would be to click a link that can't be verified as trusted.**this is a terrifying level of disregard for customer safety.**

so i ask to have my concerns raised in a case and have an email sent to me with some level of follow up at a minimum i'd like to know im actually going to receive the product im paying thousands of dollars for.

this is not an option, samsungs processes mean that sending me an email to be followed up can't be done.

i own probably somewhere in the ball park of $10,000 worth of samsung goods and am stunned by the utter indifference to customers digital safety as well as complete in ability to provide clear information on an order.to the extent that i'm no longer going to by future samsung products and will likely end up cancelling this order ... assuming i ever get a support agent that can help me.  


edit  
tl;dr  


samsung need to seriously address their behavior and do a far better job of communicating clearly when their customers need to take action to ensure an order is delivered.  


their current approach is so bad it can only serve to encourage customers to disregard sensible safety practices and place themselves at risk to ensure orders get delivered."

"has the new z flip model fixed the issues the first two models had? hey everyone, 

&#x200b;

basically, it's the title. i'm closing in on a upgrade for my current phone (it's currently the s21 5g model) and i'm going to be sticking with samsung going forward. nothing but positives about my current phone with the only issue being the charging port currently is very buggy. as in, only charges at certain angles and sometimes it just disconnects the charger (i believe it might just be the charging port not holding the charger cable in right is all, but easy to get around).

&#x200b;

i was looking at the z flip 4 due to the size when shut is a big positive, my current job means having a large phone in my pocket will increase the chances of accidental presses and damage to the screen, my current screen protector that has been fantastic from getting the phone nearly 2 years ago, (i got a fantastic deal on the newest release due to how long the account has been on the provider).

&#x200b;

i've watched some youtube videos, but the issue i've found is a lot of the big 'techtubers' tend to focus fully on the positives, be it personal preference or if they don't want to upset samsung i don't know, but i know the original model and the z flip 2 had several issues which i thought i'd ask before going for the plunge.

&#x200b;

have they sorted out the issue the hinge had with it failing fast in daily use?

has the battery life been improved? i work 12 hour shifts and while i'm not on my phone the entire 12 hours, i saw several people complaining even in rest mode the battery drained fast.

how is the front screen in terms of usefulness? it's not one that needs any sort of squinting to see in darker lights is it?

how is the build quality on it? samsung phones in my experience have been really well built and can take a bit of a beating, not saying i'm going to be throwing the phone at the wall, but there will be times a box may hit it, will it hold up with a case?

&#x200b;

i won't be upgrading until april so i also don't know if they are going to be releasing a z flip 5 soon, which is another question actually.

&#x200b;

any advice/help would be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading through my wall of text."
"i'm upgrading to the s23u and i feel like i don't get the most out of these devices. i'm also fairly technical, but never dove into the smartphone waters hard. what are some more less-obvious things you can do with these high powered phones? (outside of flashlight, text, camera and reddit) i've been a very basic smartphone user. having a pretty deep technical professional background, these still sort of sit in the realm of ""those new fangled things"" and i haven't done much more than customize my os/ui and use a few basic apps.

what kind of things do you use your phone for? what are some good ways to use these powerful phones to enrich day to day life?"

as soon as i got the ""connected but no internet"" i looked in my logs - ""router specific history"" and what i am seeing is i got:

"why the ultra devices still aren't a true flawless phone 1. it still only uses an 8-bit screen. come on samsung, it costs way above 1000‚Ç¨ and you guys can build really nice screens so why not go for atleast 10-bit?
2. the lack of bluetooth codecs. pretty annoying to me, as my kz aptx-hd cable will put out aptx at best with the s23 ultra i want to buy soon..

i really just want to see if maybe, someone from samsung checks these forums and sees the criticism. i bought my cable specifically for aptx hd, now i can't use it anymore, it just sucks for me. maybe we can get a little thread started here, with more negatives but also positives! the s-pen as an example is really nice, but the ram limitation for the base model is questionable."

"s23 ultra case options i havent been in the market for a case in a long time, but after ordering the s23 ultra, i think i need to change that. ive done a lot of research, but im looking for slightly different input than what other people have asked for. mind you, i dont drop my phone often or ever, its more of a security than a need.

the side question i have is magsafe. is it worth it? i havent looked into it before but i see quite a few cases with it, or the halo from esr. any experience? normally i just have a metal plate between my phone and case, but the change might be welcome, even after buying a bunch of accessories to make it worth my time. any experience on that specifically is very welcome.

i see a lot of clear cases available, but im afraid of them being gross or nasty after a while of use, with yellowing color, scratches, and dust and grime getting in and being clearly visible.. has anyone had similar problems? should this not be an active concern?

i would love a ""do all case"" but at the same time i dont want or need a tank - im more interested just because having the ""full enclosure"" is an interesting concept for the outdoors or in general.

last option im interested in is protective, but slim. ive had pitaka and loved it, mous and loved it, but looking for other options as well.

any advice is welcome, just trying to raise some of my own opinions and gain some knowledge!"

"modular phone cases? hey r/samsung! 

i'm currently awaiting my new s23 ultra, and one of the most exciting parts of the phone shopping process was my plan to get a peak design case for my next phone. i knew i'd be switching, but it wasn't worth the startup cost for my current popsocket attachments until i was already buying a new phone anyway. 

as it turns out, the magnetic attachment system for peakdesign will disable the most exciting feature of the new phone, that being the stylus. does anyone know of any other relatively slim and sleek cases that have a full modular system of accessories? the ones that sound most interesting to me are: 

\-wallet

\-something to attach a pop socket to

\-additional battery

\-additional storage

\-additional ports, such as usb-c, ethernet, or hdmi

\-items like rangefinders

i have been looking around both business and personal solutions providers for a case that may work, but all that i have found have turned out to either rely on magnets, rendering the stylus useless, or not having an option for popsocket/wallet/popwallet (which i currently use), and not having a popsocket or wallet option at all is unfortunately a dealbreaker. 

really, if i could get a peak design case with no magnets but with access to all of the peak design accessories, i'd be happiest. does anyone know of other good phone case systems with some modularity?"
"the truth (literally!) no one tells you about android vs ios updates i was not sure where to post this observation, but since i love samsung's version of android, i would like to leave it there for people who are interested.  


switcher here. i was an iphone user for more than 10 years but in 2022 i switched to samsung for a second time. partly because of being impressed by an old samsung phone from 2012. you will probably not believe but it still goes to internet, uses latest chrome version (or any browser of your choice) and even installs most apps from google play. and it is on kitkat 4.4. i mean, it is the same age as the iphone 5 that already cannot open any webpage on it's old ios 10 and install any app (maximum that could have been installed, original was ios 6 that is the same age as android 4)  


generally, one of the major reasons i switched was being tired of constant updates.   
often i see people on the web and on reddit particularly writing that ""no android manufacturer has such software support as apple"". as an ""apple veteran"" i have went through 13 major updates on different devices (ipad 1, ipad air 2, iphone 4, 5, 6s, 11 pro). and the way they serve the update didn't change throughout the years: apple literally downloads it to your device without your consent when you plug the phone on charger and wifi, then out of the blue (often when you are very busy and do not have time for that) they ask ""install update now or at night"", and you can only postpone it by clicking ""at night"". then you can delete it from storage but every time a newer version comes out ( for example 15.0.1, 16.1.3 etc) it will download again.  


most people will just hit ""install"" and it will download. it is a hit-or-miss, but usually every update is a slowdown comparing to the original version. users often face bugs with every single update. and there is no way back, you cannot revert to the original version if you don't like the one that you had installed.  


sure thing, updates bring security, better experience, blah blah blah and also bring users to the store in search of a new phone. it is a simple psychological trick everyone knows at apple, and considering how hard it is to get free of the ""ecosystem"", users usually rush to get a newer iphone.  


but what if you just do not update on iphone or ipad? first two years it is going to be ok. after that time sites usually start to lag and not open pages correctly, or the load time increases significantly. this is especially a problem of all banking apps due to them constantly updating all the site code. in the same time, this issue does not exist on android. yes, you get me right: ios update means everything. if you do not update, you are out. because all the browsers on ios are based on safari's webkit, so literally if you download chrome it will change nothing except the skin, sites won't open and there are gonna be even more slowdowns. after 3 years developers usually drop support for older ios versions and require newer ones. and 3 years literally means 3 major ios versions, thus people on ios13 cannot get most new apps and app versions on their devices unless they update or buy a new iphone if their ones does not support the update.  


in fact, you are in matrix and are provided with ""two pills"": have a slow but up-to-date iphone or have a fast but unsupported one.

on the other hand, on android you can install any modern app (and browser) even as it turns out, on 4.4 kitkat which is the similar age as the ios 5.1.1 that is installed on my mentioned above ipad 1.   


in fact, getting no update on android phone does not mean you will have problems with apps and services. it just means that you don't get newer os features and have a less secure phone. but if you know at least something in tech, does it even make sense? modern android is already dummy-proof enough not to allow the install from untrusted sources, as well as you won't probably get anything if you use up-to-date browser (which you do).  


in comparison, how does it feel to have constant updates on apple? you basically become a beta tester for anything apple wants to install on your phone. you have to deal with lags, bugs, slowdowns and incompatibility issues. and you cannot ""roll back to original app version"" like on android or just re-flash the original os unless you have shsh blobs (you surely won't have those at the moment you already updated). and in the end you have to buy a new phone because yours does not work as you wish it to. also you cannot just go and install old app ""apk"" (.ipa in ios) from web, because ""security"" and copyright, unless you saved the ones tied to your apple id on your pc or mac.  


i have lots of examples of how updates killed my idevices, but will tell you only the recent one. since 2014 i was effectively making music on my ipad. i had even bought official apple lightning to usb adapter to be able to connect my midi keyboard. after i installed the ios 15 update which i didn't want to do but had to (one of the apps stopped updating) the midi protocol stopped working, synth does not connect and garageband and similar apps freeze when it tries to connect and... nothing in the end. like, wtf. i was making music and suddenly cannot. and you know what is the worst? i cannot go back and this device is now called ""obsolete"", so it does not get any updates or patches except some security ones that do not fix such issues. now my only choice is to buy a newer ipad and hope the problem is fixed already, yet i am sure it is not and the device itself is not worth it.  


so next time you see anyone bragging that android has no updates, show them my post and see their reaction. because personally i would rather get no system updates than all these untested, poorly optimised and useless yearly updates like it is on apple devices.  


people who still have galaxy s3, s4, s5 and older than s10, i know you are here on this sub and i want to hear your voice! please, tell what is your experience in using the non-updated smartphones? is it a deal-breaker or something it is possible to live with?"

"apple‚Äôs iphones winning over gen z‚Äîand the world‚Äôs premium market the wall street journal

trend puts pressure on rival samsung, maker of high-end android smartphones

seoul‚Äîconsumers around the world are increasingly choosing  apple inc.‚Äôs iphones over high-end android smartphones, with younger users seen as pushing the company toward the level of dominance in the market globally that it has enjoyed in the u.s.

from europe to asia, apple‚Äôs market lead in the premium bracket  is growing, and polls show that people in their teens and early 20s,  known as gen z, increasingly see the iphone as a must-have. converts say  they are drawn by its design, cameras and airdrop features for sharing  photos.

the trend is putting apple‚Äôs chief rival, samsung electronics co., under pressure and threatening the south korean  company‚Äôs lead in the overall global smartphone market. samsung has been  promoting its splashy foldable phones and 100x zoom cameras on the latest galaxy s23 ultra that brought a ‚Äúwow‚Äù from elon musk on twitter.

in samsung‚Äôs backyard, where the brand‚Äôs android smartphones have held sway, apple‚Äôs clout has been growing since the company opened its first store in south korea  in 2018. apple now has four stores in the country, where its  mobile-payment system apple pay will soon become available for the first  time.

around 52% of people age 18 to 29 in south korea were using an  apple smartphone as of 2022, up from 44% two years earlier, according to  polls by gallup korea. samsung‚Äôs share of this age group slipped to 44%  from 45% in that time, the polls showed. for all older age groups,  samsung phones remain most prevalent.

chung kyung-rim, a 22-year-old college student in seoul, said nearly  all of her peers use an iphone. apple‚Äôs reputation for prettier designs  and good photos has stuck through the years, she said, though she thinks  samsung‚Äôs devices have improved in looks and likes the diverse colors of samsung‚Äôs latest flip phones, she said.

apple‚Äôs rise among young people will likely help the u.s.  firm‚Äôs position in the high-end phone business that it has been leading.  apple‚Äôs share of worldwide shipments of smartphones priced at $800 and  above grew to 76% last year from 65% in 2018, while samsung‚Äôs declined  to 17% from 27%, according to canalys, a tech-market researcher. china  has been one major driver of growth for apple after u.s. sanctions crippled another rival, huawei technologies co.

samsung remains the world‚Äôs largest smartphone maker by overall  shipments, a title it has held since 2012. even here, apple is closing  in on its rival. samsung‚Äôs market share has held roughly steady at  around 21% for the past five years, according to canalys, while apple‚Äôs  share climbed to 19% in 2022 from 15% in 2018.

high-end smartphones are critical for phone makers as they  bring in the biggest profits and showcase technological capabilities and  leadership, said tom kang, a seoul-based director at counterpoint  research.

the pricier phone segment also represents a pocket of resilience in  an industry that has been sliding. last year, global shipments of  smartphones priced above $800 grew 1%, while overall shipments of  smartphones fell 12%, according to canalys.

a samsung spokesman noted that preorder volumes for the recently launched galaxy s23 smartphone series were higher than for the prior year‚Äôs models, with 60% of consumers choosing the most-expensive galaxy s23 ultra.

apple didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.

in the u.s., where apple accounted for 77% of the  premium-smartphone market last year according to canalys, one reason for  the popularity of iphones among young people has been the prevalence of  imessage, apple‚Äôs messaging app that is widely used and designates different colors for iphone users and android users.

elsewhere in the world that is seen as less of an edge because third-party mobile messengers are more mainstream, from whatsapp in europe to kakaotalk in south korea.

young people around the world say they are attracted by  apple-exclusive features such as airdrop, which enables easy sharing  between iphones between friends, and preferences for apple‚Äôs photography  and design.

for years, apple‚Äôs marketing has focused on taking cinematic photos and videos.

today‚Äôs top-end iphone and samsung galaxy smartphone both have  similar camera components and excel at capturing quality high-resolution  photos, said choi kab-soo, a travel photographer living in seoul who  runs smartphone-photography classes.

some differences in the color expression of the photos might  make people feel that apple‚Äôs phones take better photos in everyday  settings, said mr. choi, who uses an iphone.

sarah carrivale, a 24-year-old graduate student living in  paris, has noticed that more people around her age are using  iphones‚Äîaround 7 in 10 she estimates.

she switched to an iphone 12 two years ago, after using a  string of android devices including ones from samsung and a chinese  brand. after taking a while to get used to the iphone, she said she is  satisfied with its durability, ease of navigation and cameras.

‚Äúonce you get an iphone, in a way there‚Äôs no turning back,‚Äù ms. carrivale said.

across western europe, android users under the age of 25 were  almost three times more likely to prefer apple for their next smartphone  than older age groups, according to a poll last year by canalys of  4,000 individuals from the u.k., germany, spain and italy. apple users  under 25 were more than twice as likely as android users of the same age  to stick with their respective operating systems, the poll showed.

apps on an iphone feel faster and more glitch-free, even if the  specs are similar to an android device, said nicholas leonzi, a  26-year-old retail worker in london. he tried out a samsung galaxy s21  ultra in 2021, which had ‚Äúcool‚Äù features  like charging his galaxy buds pro earphones on the back of the phone. a  regular phone upgrader, he reverted back to apple after a year and is using the latest version of the airpods pro.

apple has also grown by building its products based on the same  operating system, helping strengthen user retention and brand loyalty.  android smartphones have far more players in the mix because it isn‚Äôt a  closed operating system like apple‚Äôs.

‚Äúas younger consumers grow stickier to the apple ecosystem, it‚Äôll become harder for samsung to compete with apple,‚Äù said                       nicole peng,          a canalys senior vice president.

samsung, which leads the android segment, is working to catch up  by focusing efforts on making its products from smartphones to tvs to  appliances, and those of partner brands, work together in the most  hassle-free manner possible.

one bright spot for samsung is that it is leading the foldable-smartphones category  it helped pioneer. sales of foldable phones represent less than 1% of  the smartphones shipped worldwide today, but their increased popularity  could boost samsung‚Äôs future position in the premium category, analysts  say. apple has yet to announce any plans for foldable phones.

lee hye-jin, whose high-school-age daughter and son have owned  iphones since middle school in seoul, highlighted the iphone‚Äôs appeal to  younger generations. she estimated that 7 out of 10 of her children‚Äôs  classmates are iphone users.

‚Äúthey say it‚Äôs more ‚Äòhip‚Äô to use apple,‚Äù she said."

"just switched from a iphone 13 pro to the new s23 ultra and i love it i'm writing this, to maybe help some people who are sitting on the fence of switching from an ios device to an android device.

i was an apple user since the iphone 4, which was a great time and a lot of innovation on apple's part. however, since the iphone xr and ios 12, it felt the same for me every year. 1.5 years ago, i was pulled into buying a new 13 pro, but i wasn't just excited anymore. i wanted something new. first i tried the z flip 4, but returned it because of the narrow screen (it's so narrow!). 

when i saw that the s23 ultra came out, i was really tempted. i bought the new phone and gifted my 13 pro to my girlfriend who doesn't really care about phones at all, lol. 

i'm using it now for a couple of days and i can say i'm in love. the notification system was weird for me in the beginning, but now i wonder how i could ever like the notification system on ios. it's so fast and intuitive, you can directly answer in the notifications, you can scroll in widgets. i love watching movies on youtube and netflix. i can customize stuff how i want. it has great night shots, that i took last weekend are way better than on iphone (to me at least, everyone has different taste). 

i can really recommend this phone as a good entry to android!"

"the switch i started with the iphone 7 plus until the xs max and then i swichted to the s22 for a change. i fell in love with the design of the phone, which made me switch to samsung.

now i can't wait on the realease of the s23. i am gonna go with the plus maybe. 

i still use a macbook and i admit that the ecosystem of apple works great. but the design is always the same and boring. one of the reasons i switched to samsung is because of the round watch, i don't like the square watches.

anyone else made a switch from apple tot samsung without any regret?"

"anyone having issues with their s23 refusing to wireless charge? my wife got her new s23 2 weeks ago and is having problems with wireless charging. every so often it just stops working. you put it onto a wireless charger and nothing happens, no messages, no acknowledgement that it's even trying to charge. once this happens, the only way to fix it is a reboot. once you reboot, it starts wireless charging as normal.

it doesn't stop charging part way through, if you put the phone on the charger it either starts working or nothing!. if it starts charging, it will charge ok until full. so it's not a temperature issue.

we have tried 4 different wireless chargers (a samsung one, two from amazon and an in-car one). they all work fine until the phone decides to stop recognising the chargers and then none work.

we have even tried  wireless power sharing from my s23 ultra - nothing until a reboot.

if we plug in a charging cable, it will start charging ok, but still won't wireless charge.

it can happen at any battery level, we've seen it at 46%, 65%, 85% and 96%.

my s23 ultra uses the same wireless chargers without issue. we still have my wife's s21 and that has never had issues with the same chargers. so i am 100% sure it's not a charger issue.

we are wondering if it's a hardware of software issue. if it's hardware we need to get the phone returned and replaced, if it's a software issue then we can perhaps wait for samsung to fix it.

anyone else and similar experience?

thanks."

is it possible to have a pa$$word with more than 16 digits on my a22 ? title
i 3d printed a s22's camera bump for the s23 
"s23 ultra charger brick suggestion im getting a solid 1day 10hours of battery life with my s23ultra. so i'm not much concerned about the charging speeds as such. 
i have 15 watt charger that came with my s10 so ive been using the same. 
0-100% takes aroung 1hr 50 mins. with 15 watts charger.

so im confused if i should get a 25watt or 45watt charger. how much time it'll save? and battery degradation caused by this fast charging if any? 

i'm more inclined towards getting samsung chargers only, and not anker ones."
s21 still a good phone? my mom is wanting to get my younger sister a new phone. she has the a12 now and it's junk. samsung has the s21 refurbished with warranty for right under $500 with trade in of an old a11 we have. is this still a good deal? seems kinda high but it comes with warranty and is pretty much considered new since it's refurbished. thanks for any suggestions.
"[serious] notification icons need to be different colors there was recently an update that went out that changed all of the notifications on my phone to be the same color.

for example, these are the old notifications: [here](https://i.imgur.com/potnlb9.jpg).

and these are the [new ones](https://i.imgur.com/ke4fdw0.jpg)

before, it was easy to scan down the list as a whole, pausing my eyes only on the color of the text. familiarity of what's usually in that list (lets face it, we don't always clear *all* of our notifications) contrasts nicely with what's new to the list, especially when there are so many items i need to scroll down to see all of them. i'm able to memorize its contents with less effort. it was much easier to use. 

on the new color scheme, my old habits of scanning are obsolete. i'm having a difficult time. i've been trying to scan down the left side only to see what app it is, then i read the notification itself. it's a lot to take in. the only way to tell apps apart is a basic shape inside that purple bubble and my vision isn't what it used to be on these high density phone displays.  

i really don't like the change. you probably could have guessed that by now. if this was an a-b test, please dial me down. if this is the new default setting, please reconsider. if there's an easy way to get the colored title text back, even better. but i will still be peaved that it just changed to this without my consent. i still use old reddit for goodness sake.

if you're looking for a better solution, may i suggest slightly tinting the notification bars themself with the app default color. nothing wrong with a little more variation of color in our lives. you can keep it subtle yet maintained the readability. 

tldr: my phone is harder to use because of the new ui design"
do the galaxy buds have any galaxy exclusive features besides audio transfer? i only have a galaxy phone. wondering if theres any other exclusive features that makes it worth to get these buds vs others at the price point (mainly looking at live)
did you buy a case for your buds? 
"tv warranty exchange time i have a samsung tv that died, they can‚Äôt get parts and offered to exchange it.  at first i was told 2-5 days, then i was told 10-15 days, now it‚Äôs been almost a month with no contact to schedule the exchange.  
how much time do i allow before i file in small claims court?"
"the s23 is insane for game emulation! console level graphics naruto storm 4 running at 30fps i am so glad i bought this phone (s23 base 256gb) even with the camera lag issue because it can do one thing iphone and pixel phones cannot, and that is switch emulation. 

switch emulation (3ds and psp also) is insane on the s23, the snapdragon 8 gen 2 and it's gpu has really impressive performance 

here are 2 gameplay videos i recorded. i just played the game for 20+ minutes while screen recording so towards the end there is thermal throttling with more than 3 characters on the screen. throughout the 32 minutes of play time it used 5.8% battery.

i was so into the game the 2nd time i accidentally clicked stop and it didn't record but that was the best performance i got too since it was 30 frames the whole time without recording. 

first video i had the wrong audio setting so there is only bgm
https://youtu.be/wx8jdb0723c

second video has it all but is after 15 minutes of playing and recording.
https://youtu.be/9gyr0tyq0la


there are 2 apps that you can choose to use for emulation: 

- eggns (paid - need a supporting controller or monthly sub)

- skyline (free)

- skyline edge (patreon sub)

skyline edge is much more respectable since they built from the ground up using open source code and have been steadily improving game performance at a fast rate. they will at some point i hope overtake eggns.

eggns has more support and better frames on most games but that is because they have been around for longer, they began by taking code and profiting off it so they have a bad reputation. 

personally whatever runs the games better in the end is what i'm going to be using. the eggns developers have hinted at an ios release but i'm doubtful it will run well since there are so many restrictions on ios.

you will then need to follow guides to source your own key files, firmware and game roms. 

other games i tried on eggns: 

- astral chain 30 fps, it's pretty good but haven't gotten to intense combat yet

- mario kart 8 deluxe starts at 60 fps but it drops to 40 fps

- super mario bros u deluxe 60 fps whole time

- pokemon brilliant diamond and violet had issues maybe it needs a driver update cause others can run it

- metroid prime remastered 60 fps

so yeah pretty excited to be carrying my s23 and able to play console level games offline for about 1 hour. and still have amazing battery for the rest of the day as well."
price? i posted a question about price but it's being removed. is there a rule against discussing that topic?
"s23+ or s23u? bought both phones to test. prefer the feel and rounded edges of the s23+. the battery on the s23u is slightly better. pictures on both are nearly identical, s23u has a slight edge in color grading. other than these, which should i keep? open to keeping either."
how do i set a spotify song as my ringtone i remember i saw a button to do it before but now i don't see it
"i made a mistake switching to iphone. the ui design just isn‚Äôt as good. i need the navigation bar. it‚Äôs so annoying having to manually close my tabs. i can‚Äôt double tap to switch to my last app. it‚Äôs some weirdly specific swipe from the bottom of the screen, and if you get it wrong, it just brings you to the home screen. i can‚Äôt just flick the screen to open the unlock screen, again you have to drag it up right from the bottom - i have small hands! 

i wish there was a way to customize this phone and get a similar navigation bar üòî"
"psa: turn off ram plus...your battery life and performance will thank you basically the title. the idea of ram plus is great but in practice it works terribly and it will hurt your battery life along with hurting the performance in the meantime. after i got my s23u it was literally the first thing i turned off and multiple people who have also gotten them have been helped in their battery life considerably since i recommended they do this also.

edit: not saying this is going to be universally true for everyone obviously as everyone's needs and demands are different. my personal experiences (and no, i don't take pictures of all stats before and after i make settings changes to my devices) with previous models have shown improvements in performance and battery by both being able to turn it off if it's an option (added in one ui 5.0) or tuning it down to lower gb amounts. because of those previous experiences it was something i turned off first getting my new devices and friends of mine have had similar improvements especially in battery after i recommended they turn it off.

i understand a lot of this is anecdotal and you can discount it if you so feel inclined but i know my end user experience has been greatly improved by choosing to bypass this feature and i thought it was worth putting out there for others."
"what can i expect from samsung s22 ultra after using iphone 7 for years? i‚Äôm getting the samsung s22 ultra after using iphone 6s and 7 basically 7 years from now, and i finally decided to update my phone, what can i expect from this newer phone? (features, display quality, speed, etc?)
samsung s22 ultra 12gb

edit: the reason i bought thes22 ultra instead of s23u it‚Äôs because i found a really good discount (34% off) and i can‚Äôt afford a phone as expensive   as the samsung s23 ultra"
s23u: s-pen keeps disconnecting so i got my s23 ultra a couple days ago but basically wherever i pull the s-pen out it will immediately disconnect. when i insert it again it will connect for a couple of seconds but after that it loses the connection again. anyone else having this issue?
"looking for a reasonably priced upgrade to my galaxy s10 i have had the galaxy s10 for a long time now and it has done its job very well, but they have stopped rolling out updates, and i'd like a phone with an esim. 

i'm not in need of much, i like the size of the s10, battery life is important, but the s10's battery seemed to do ok for me, and i don't need the newest and best (s23 atm i presume ) so totally fine with used or refurbished. but am unsure if i should be looking at s20's s21's or s22's or something else entirely.

appreciate your suggestions!"
"s23 ultra vs pixel 7 pro-smoothness and daily usage? i've seen lots of posts comparing cameras, selfie cameras, and batteries. but what about smoothness in the ui, responsiveness, scrolling, and general usage?

&#x200b;

i've got a pixel 7 pro. its generally quick. the scrolling leaves a lot to be desired though. 

&#x200b;

anyone use both, and can share their experience?"
"camera problems any one else getting really high quality pictures with the 200mp camera, but at the same time those photos are useless because the processing makes you look like a sick tomato??
i cant use any pics in 200mp because it turns my entire face entirely red, and almost purple around my eyes."
"you know that 5ghz band wifi6 issue most s22/s23 ultras has been having? i may have found a good temporary solution for this. so i've been dealing with this for over a year now, trying everything under the sun to get this to work and i noticed that the majority of the time the issue happens with asus routers. and ironically i have one too, an rt-ax86u to be exact. 

so after a lot of research & trial and error, i found myself a good temporary solution that has been working for over a week now, with the wifi signal lagging very briefly on a rare occasion, with maybe one time where i thought the issue came back but the whole internet was down instead üòÖ.

so here's what i did:

1. no smart switch was used to set up my s23 ultra. never liked it to be honest. i use samsung cloud and google drive via google one to back up everything & i keep all my stuff in the cloud so it was only a re-download of what was needed. and i only brought back only my messages & call log, cuz i'm forgetful üòÖ. i also manually added my wifi to my phone, i didn't bring it over. i also cleared it from my known wifi networks as well beforehand.

2. i switched the router's software from asusmerlin back to stock asus software, and updated it to the most stable version. get it from asus directly & install it via the web gui.

3. i did both the hard factory reset and the normal factory reset after i updated the router. there's two versions of it apparently. i did the version where you are physically pressing buttons to do it, and then i did the normal one on the web gui. look up hard factory reset *insert router name here* and it'll give you the way to do it for that particular version.

4. went through initial router set-up normally. kept the same name & password, **stick to wpa2 security, you'll see why in a second**

5. *on the phone* turned on developer settings on the phone, turned on wifi safe mode.

6. settings, connections, wifi, tap on the 3 dots on the top right and choose intelligent wifi & turn off prioritize real-time data.

7. *in web gui for the router* turn off 802.11ax/wifi 6 mode. it's in wireless. make sure you do it for both bands (the first section will be which band you're editing, choose accordingly)

8. i actually kept on the 160 mhz option for the 5ghz because i want my speed dammit. hasn't affected anything.

9. switched my dns (including ipv6) out of cloudflare to a different dns, i used google. ipv4 is in the wan section, ipv6 is in the ipv6 section (switch only if you actually have that one normally) **i didn't try different dns options, google was always my second choice, my focus was not using cloudflare. try different ones and see, i was always having issues with cloudflare**

10. **for fun cuz why not** restart everything. phone, router, and modem if you're feeling fancy. why? it doesn't hurt so might as well.



that's it. no phone mac. no static ip on the phone. i'm on my 5ghz band consistently and it works almost flawlessly. granted i would love to have wifi6 available to me so i can get a better router with the 6ghz band as an option, but being able to use my 5ghz in a stable way on my phone when i need that is more important to me. so there we go."
"s22u. it needs exposure compensation. at some point, we've lost the ability to set exposure compensation on the fly with the main camera. it still is there on other modes, like night. this sucks, it is an important tool. get this done, samsung."
"got my s23 ultra wow thing is a beast it is so big!  i also have the fold 4 so my hand muscle memory is so off between the two.  it is not easy to switch between those two.  i love the screen on both but for my eyes the ulta is better.  

is there a way to increase the top navigation bar icons, time, battery % etc...  ? thanks!"
"two tips for new samsung owners (top and bottom of display!) here are two tips for new samsung owners.

1.  in the default setup the pull down quick panel does not show the brightness setting option until you pull the panel down a second time.  if you want it to show display brightness the first time, pull the panel down a second time, then hit the three dots at the top right, then hit quick panel layout, then hit brightness control, always show.
2. samsung reverses the navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen from standard android.  to reverse them back to go settings, search for navigation bar, hit navigation bar, look for button order."
"nightly charging without letting the phone sit at 100% using modes & routines modes and routines, formerly bixby routines ^(why did they change the name?!) allows your phone to limit itself at a maximum charge of 85% based on conditions. this action is called 'protect battery'.  

you can set up a conditiion between, say, 23:00 and 05:00, with protect battery on, and then at 05:00 it turns off automatically, and your phone continues towards 100%. so even without an explicit 'adaptive charging' feature like on pixel you could mimic it in this way."
"is this the year to upgrade? i have a galaxy s10 that has been very good to me, never really had any issues with it, battery life is still holding up to this day. i'm currently looking at changing phone plans and with that i could possibly get a deal on a new phone.

i guess what i'm wondering is, is the s23 a big enough leap forward, or is it worth holding out for the s24 if i think i can make it another year with my s10? 

i'm not in tune with the smartphone world, so i have no idea what the current speculations are in terms of new tech coming next year."
today i finally switched im a long time iphone user. i always had a pro max because the insane battery time. i always had the urge to switch to samsung however the battery was always bad compared to what i had. now since the release of the s23u i finally had nothing to complain. today its my first time as an samsung user and i got to say i love the phone.
"anyone else miss notification led? am i the only one who wishes phones would go back to including the led notification light? such a small thing that i miss probably more than any other feature that's been taken away from us. ü´£ always on display is great, but man, something about that pesky little led is so inviting!"
"samsung gallery - when does it index faces? i recently got my s23 ultra, and transferred a lot of photos over.

the gallery app seems to have recognized a few of the faces, but not all of them.

i'm wondering if anyone knows how or when the gallery app processes through the images so that it's easier to search for people/places etc."
"s22 ultra vs s23+ where i live, the prices are roughly the same and i can easily find a brand new s22 ultra.

i really love the design of the ultra more but the newest ultra is quite out of my price range and i wonder if it would actually make sense choosing a year old ultra over the s23+.

i know the performance and battery life is going to be worse but i don't know how worse and i have no idea about any other component (like camera or screen).

i would like to see your choice and hear your opinions.

"samsung dex is worth it! i bought the wife an s23+ solely because of samsung dex, but i was sort of taking a flyer, trusting the reviews.  

the reason i wanted dex is to watch netflix, hulu, channels dvr, etc. while camping without incurring hotspot data.  mere screen mirroring wouldn't allow that due to hdcp issues (although amazon prime seems to work).  

finally tried it this morning and it works great with an hdmi cable connection, but wireless is still an issue (at least using screen mirroring on a fire cube).  

and it doesn't hurt that the s23+ came with 512gb of storage.  that will allow the s23+ to replace the pc we used to use for downloaded content."
samsung one ui 5.1 hidden features and tips 
"notification category before one ui 5 update, if i tapped on settings, it would take me to the list of notification categories and highlight/flash the one that the particular notification came from. now after one ui 5 update, it takes me to the app's main notification settings, but not to the notification category. so now there's no way to know specifically what category the notification came from so that you can change settings for that category."
"samsung tv default start to hdmi 4? i've got my pc connected to hdmi4 on my new 55"" qn90b and i really want power on to just always start there. i don't suppose there is a setting i haven't yet found to do that, is there?"
i think my wifi issue got magicly fixed.s23 ultra had my wifi on for a few hours now and atill works fast and stable. i did nothing beside the factory reset. does aamsung so stealth updates or my router?
"why did samsung stop making affordable tablets with s-pen i don't understand why they removed the s-pen from the a series the bezel are now thicker and the aspect ratio is weird it looks elongated, maybe it's just me but it looks kinda ugly they should've just keep the tab a8 with s-pen body and give it better internals.

the tab a 8.4 (2020) would be such a good contender for the ipad mini if it had with better internals + s-pen they have similar screen size but the tab a 8.4's bezels is significantly thinner plus it'll probably be more affordable, maybe they won't be comparable performance wise but it'll be the second best mini tablet available and i can see a lot of business using it too"
is there any chance that older flagships get a smooth lens transition? i just love how how smooth switching through lenses is on s23 series. on my s22 it feels like the transition is in 10fps. any chance it will get better one day?

galaxy watch 5 pro battery backup? what is the battery life like for watch 5 pro?
is battery life the only exciting thing s23 series has going for it? all i see are posts and posts about how amazing the battery life is (or lack of). is that the only thing people are concerned about now? why not buy a chinese brand that can charge to 100% in 10 minutes?

2. i need to manually switch to the buds via the tv remote. i understand that there won't be an auto switch option for my tv(2021 range) but the moment i disconnect my buds the tv defaults back to the tv speaker instead of my default soundbar setup. is there any way to change this? maybe a short cut using smart things to switch between bluetooth and sound bar that i'm overlooking?

"s23 ultra best camera setups - issue with indoor high contrast scenes though been comparing shots on the samsung s23 ultra i just got to my note 20 ultra.  as expected, it's not a night and day difference of course.  but in most scenes, the s23 ultra produces moderately better results with the biggest difference when using expert raw in 50mp mode both jpg and raw output (while the latter is going to be better for post editing.  i imagine 200mp is good too but i'm passing on that large of file size).

i found what i think though is a limitation in the camera software (or sensor).  hopefully samsung will fix it in a future update. it is for moderately low light indoor photos (like late afternoon and overcast with no indoor lighting turned on), but where you have a bright scene through the windows (like snowy mountains).  i imagine this happens in any room where you have bright window scene and not a bright room. 

the normal camera on the note20 ultra does much better metering and doesn't blow out the scene in the windows.  the s23 ultra comes very close if using the normal camera in 12mp mode but at best it's equal to the note in other tests the s23 ultra totally blew out the window scene where the note 20 ultra didn't.  in this test scene it got a little worse in 50mp mode.  then it gets even worse in pro mode.  in expert raw it is bad too in some circumstances no matter what metering mode you select or exposure setting.  if you are lucky to get a decent shot in expert raw you can tweak the raw output in adobe lightroom, but it's still not as good as the normal camera mode on both phones! where as most other shot scenes, the expert raw in 50mp mode is superior to the other modes and anything the note 20 ultra puts out, but you need to zoom in on the photo to really notice the difference.  (safe to say if you're a note 20 ultra user (or s21/22 ultra), you're not missing out much as the 200mp sensor in the s23 ultra is as i expected part modest improvement and part a lot of marketing hype.)

here's a comparison between normal 12mp camera output on note 20 and s23 ultra, then an adobe lightroom edited raw image coming from expert raw on the s23 ultra in 12mp mode.  

so the end conclusion is that in the current state of the software, on the s23 ultra, for high contrast moderate natural light indoor shots like this, you are best just using the standard 12mp auto mode in the regular camera app. whereas in most other situations you get the best quality with reasonable file size shooting in expert raw at 50mp.

this is some straight up monopolistic bullshit. it's deliberately targeted to incentives you using samsung password vault-which i am not going to do. i have had this phone for 2 years now, this new bullshit only started with the last major software update in december.

"reason of battery draining during night hello.
my phone is  base s22 sd . i noticed it drains about 3 or 4 percents during the night. there is no app running in the background and i turn off all the features like the location , mobile data and... at night.
at first, i thought it is because of sim card and phone signal that consumes power. i enabled airplane mode for 2 nights to see differences but surprisingly i got the same results!!! 
- does anyone know what is the reason for the battery draining during the night?"

"cancelling order (+cancelling trade-in) so in my other post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11b0fks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11b0fks/)) i was debating keeping the s23 ultra due to the size.

i decided not to keep it since i just can't get happy with it and have to trust my gut feeling here.

when i purchased, i paid just over ¬£800 including a bunch of discounts and a trade in discount of ¬£290 for my existing phone. (which i have not yet sent to them)

i spoke to samsung about returning the s23 ultra , and they said they would refund me the ¬£800 when i return the phone, and since i would not be sending my s20 to them, would be charged ¬£290 from the trade in team.

i can't get my head around how this would make sense, because in my mind , the ¬£290 discount would only be applicable if i kept the device , but since i'm cancelling altogether, can't see how that is logical?

am i getting this wrong?

tldr : paid ¬£800 , got the s23 ultra , would have cost me ¬£290 more without a trade in, didn't send the trade in, cancelling order, should be getting ¬£800 back and calling it a day?"

screen protectors i'm just looking for something that's easy to apply and compatible with the case.  i normally just use the clear film protectors on amazon. they've worked well for my s9+ and my wife's s23 ultra.

"bixby text-to-call needs a customizable intro message so far everyone i've shown it to thinks it's cool, but they would hang up in the first few seconds thinking they dialed the wrong number or it was unavailable or something. a short message like ""hi, this is <name> using text-to-speech"" would be far more useful. it can already do custom text, so this should be pretty straightforward if samsung isn't hung up on forcing us to throw ""bixby"" out there."

"s23 ultra wifi 6 connectivity issue - this might be a hardware issue after troubleshooting. so my wife and i both purchased s23 ultras.  i have black, she has purple, both unlocked.  it guy here, gigabit internet with wifi 6 router (tp-link ax11000)  i have had the infamous wifi - ""connected but no internet: every day since we got them on feb 17th.  my wife's phone has never had it.  i tried all the fixes/workarounds and mirrored them on my wife's s23u to see if i can get her's to have the issue. nothing has worked for my phone, yet my wife still had not had the issue.  we both took the feb update yesterday and i still have the issue, she does not.  if this was a firmware or drive issue, it should affect us both, but being her phone has not had the issue, and many people in threads regarding this issue have stated they have not had it, i am leaning towards this being a hardware issue with the wifi radio/receiver in our phone.  thoughts?

edit- went to best buy and had them swap my phone.  was not home even 30 minutes and the issue happened again.  i just disabled ax on my router (was not using wpa3)."

"avoid pixel phones i've had my pixel 7 for under a month, and i've had to contact customer support on a few things, firstly my 3 months free youtube premium to which they stated if you have already used any free trial then you cannot use this. i told them i have used a free trial but there's an option for another free month to which i have activated and sent the screenshot stating that isn't the issue. they told me well we can't do anything about it. 

my next issue was the trade in services and how my phone got rejected for screen burns, i sent them the pictures clearly showing there are no burns. they said they have escalated it to the highest tier and their response was because it has been returned we can't do much but here you go a free 40¬£ gift card. if this is there responses a month into my new phone what will it be when my phone experiences any hardware or software issues. to put it simply i don't trust this brand and i will not purchase a pixel phone anytime in the near future.

i will be switching back to samsung as it's more reliable, has better stock apps, consistent pictures, quick menu and widgets are inconveniently too large with no added benefit, google photos and gallery's are light years behind samsung gallery in terms of customisation, google keyboard and microsoft as well. i've had to download a couple of apps because samsung had irmt stock google didn't for example samsung pass, background media player, music player, that's actually good and customisable, samsung notes, if your screen is off you can't hold to reduce the volume you have to tap it to reduce it or turn the screen on to hold it - i use this alot when i'm sleeping so it's a daily issue but exclusive to me. not sure why wifi and data are not separate options and sometimes weirdly turns on wifi and connects me even though i've had it off, i had to install a new app that allows me to add documents or pictures as a shortcut on the home screen

as for what's good from the pixel: it's smoooth, above average battery life, i like the ss features, when the picture is good it's amazing, dnd works amazing - miles ahead of samsung, others i can't think of as of right now. 

all in all its a great phone but compared to samsung i definitely have missed a lot of features and the customer service with samsung is top notch compared to google and this is why i am making the move, ofcourse backed with the downsides that i have with the phone."
why are samsung cameras so slow? i have been using my f23 5g and noticed that it's camera shutters are quite slow. it's almost as if samsung knows when i want to snap an important situation and automatically slows the shutter . any way to change this?

i was very reluctant updating my phone (s21 fe 5g), and i actually regret it now. i'm just hoping for a fix soon."

i have seen mixed reports about the z flip 4 but mainly comparing it to the very top tier phones - what are people's thoughts on the camera coming from a more budget phone? i don't do a huge amount of photography just have a few events coming up and want to get some decent pictures of family and friends and for various reasons, a folding phone would be super handy for me providing the trade off on spec isn't enormous."

"s23 ultra cut my hand...defect? received my s23 ultra today with much excitement. transferred everything over from my s21+ and while i'm playing around with it and getting used to the larger size of the device, it slides out of my hand and cuts my palm...lol. upon closer inspection i find that the on back of the phone, on the left side, the chassis is razor sharp and raised higher than other parts of the phone. the cut wasn't anything crazy, more like a big papercut, and i reckon it really won't be a problem once i put a case on it but not really what i was expecting from a $1,300+ phone...

has anyone else noticed this?

edit: i did try to take photos but it's hard to tell, unfortunately."

time to celebrate guys as an android user.

it's sad that samsung's exynos processor failed so bad. especially since my s10, when it was an amazing and powerful soc.

but samsung burnt european users with that chip (incapable to keep up with the competition, including system lags) it is questionable whether they will gain back their trust and mine.

i feel samsung should acquire qualcomm and let their own failed attempt of making an own chip go.

rest of the world (row) doesn't have any idea what we had to deal with (as europeans (for the past 3 years, we had been the guinea pig with their exynos attempt and it failed lately.

samsung generally should learn from it and make one chip for their phone anywhere else in the world and make a firm decision on what to do (apple's own soc as an example) and not create two classes of users on the same phone.

now i couldn't care less with my s23 but boy oh boy did samsung burn me with their european s22,  i will not forget this samsung."

\-	samsung fold screen reliability

my fold 3 main screen failed at 18 months old.  anecdotal evidence from friends on social media seemed to suggest this is common, usually somewhere between 18 months to 24 months.  some of my friends with samsung folding screen devices have even had 2 different models and they have had both different models fail in this timeframe.  as it‚Äôs outside of warranty samsung want at least $700 to repair it presumably so it can fail again at some point in the future?

   

this has now left me with 6 samsung tags that appear to be useless as i‚Äôm not likely buying another samsung phone.

  

would be interesting to hear in the comments from people who have had any samsung folding phone for a long period (at least 18 months?) to see how they feel about their reliability.

  

\-	[samsung s23 screen wrinkle](https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-screen-wrinkle) 

(i‚Äôve not suffered this, included as evidence of continued failure)

although this is still new and no one really knows for sure how many are affected, it‚Äôs clearly a defect and the excuse from samsung is on par with apples ‚Äúyour holding it wrong‚Äù.  this is not a cheap phone and neither is the waterproofing/dustproofing process so, why has it only appear on these new models?  manufacturing or design defect?  it doesn‚Äôt matter how minor it is, it‚Äôs still a defect and under uk law (at least when i was at school) a product had to be ‚Äúfree from minor defect‚Äù or could be returned.

  

samsung have cost me well over $2000 in wasted money (lest we not also forget time!) and peripherals i no longer have a use for.  given this i don‚Äôt think i can trust samsung anymore as either their design, manufacture or qa (or combination) just seem to be failing and these are the issues i‚Äôm aware of, i‚Äôm guessing there might be more. 

  

how many of you feel like you can still trust samsung mobile?  specially interested in folding screen phone owners because \*\*maybe\*\* you can give me the trust i need to spend $700 repairing rather than just buying a \*\*brand new\*\* pixel 7 pro, motorola edge 30 ultra or oneplus for the same money?"

"galaxy s23 ultra so i recentlyswitched over from iphone and boy am i loving it so far, i also got the galaxy watch 5 pro and its nice but not a well rounded as an apple watch. one other complaint is that bixby is downright horrible, always asking me to continue on my phone, if i wanted to do that i would have just used my phone in the first place. i also cant understand shuffly my music for some reason. siri is definitelylightyears ahead of bixby. google assistant has taken bixby's place."
"s23 ultra wifi 6 connectivity issue bug still not fixed with february update (awbe) just installed the february update and unfortunately the infamous and widely reported wifi 6 bug has still not been fixed. we will now have to wait for another month for the next update, if samsung finally decides to acknowledge this bug and fix it. 

the reports are so numerous they are on multiple forums. it is clearly a driver issue that samsung needs to fix.

1. [samsung members thread](https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s23/s23-ultra-wifi-loses-internet-connection/td-p/2509418)

2. reddit threads: [1](https://old.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11ados6/so_i_did_a_factory_reset_and_wifi_keeps_dropplng/), [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/119tp4j/s23_ultras_wifi_problem_seems_to_happen_only_on/), [3](https://old.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/119o3te/s23_ultra_wifi_connected_without_internet/), [4](https://old.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/117p5q0/still_having_weird_wifi_issues_with_my_s23_ultra/), [5](https://old.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1162goq/are_any_s23u_owners_having_connectivity_problems/), and many more if you search.

3. [xda thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/wifi-trouble.4549663/)

for me and from many reports, this happens on all wifi 6 networks, at home and at work and outside at the mall. it is not an issue with some particular configuration or router. it is an issue with the s23 ultra wifi software/driver and how it handles wifi 6 networks. it does not seem happen on wifi 5 or wifi 6e from the reports and my experience, so switching to either will resolve the issue until samsung fixes it.

samsung, please acknowledge this bug at the least on your own forums and tell us you are going to fix it! keeping us in the dark is worse than having an expected timeline to fix it."

"s23 ultra - size concerns so after 7 days, i still haven't gotten used to the size of the s23 ultra , i find it heavy and the lack of round edges kinda annoying for one handed use.

i haven't sent back my old phone as a trade in yet, and still within the returns window for the s23 (knowing samsung are pretty good with this).

anyone else having the same dilemma ? the screen is great and the cameras are too , but the ""feel"" of it is putting me off.

be interested to hear from others, even if you moved to the s22 ultra last year. tia"

i was on lte all the time. first i was on a train for about 45min. i wasn't really using my phone all the time maybe for like half of the ride. then i used my phone for about 35min with 1% brightness and extra dim set to maximum intensity. after that, during the day i was checking some social media etc. with higher brightness and then went back on a train with similar usage. and holy, my battery just got sucked. you might argue that i had poor signal in the train but it was like half of my total usage today and i shouldn't get 2h sot in any conditions! beside the train i had a great signal as i was in the city center. how is your battery life after oneui 5.1? also, note that i had most of my apps in deep sleep, smart suggestions off, and i followed most of the battery saving tips and tricks besides the power saving mode(i won't give up on 120hz)."

"discussion: does anyone have experience with mirroring two phones? (large/heavy in bag, small in pocket) i'm using samsung s23 and enjoy certain aspects, such as battery life and camera. at the same time  i really miss the size and weight of earlier phones such as samsung s6, which i can easily keep in my pocket. 

a potential solution would be to leave the larger samsung s23  in my bag most of the time, with a smaller and lighter phone which simply mirrors the larger phone via bluetooth or 5g. the principle is similar to how i use parsec to give my laptop the powers of my desktop pc.

google search suggests that this is possible via various apps, does anyone have practical experience with this?"

has anyone tried removing the smart tag guts from the case to make them slimmer?  i think samsung is really missing the boat here!"
"s22 was the worst decision ever i got the s22 for my birthday in december 2022 and i feel like i made my parents waste 700‚Ç¨. my previous phone (2019-2022) was s10e and before that an s4 so, although i like iphone better, i'm more comfortable with samsung but this phone (s22) doesn't feel like an upgrade in any way. here are the 2 main things i suffer the most with this phone:

1. selfie camera is disgusting. in social media apps (whatsapp, bereal, ig...) if there's low light, the pic will turn out grey, it doesn't capture any color and my face has patches of my skin tone color in a grey background. quality is awful. 

2. charging takes forever. i don't know why but  i cannot use my phone while charging because it doesn't charge at all, it just maintains the same % or charges 1%/5min. literally today i was doing breakfast while watching yt in the background, my phone started at 24% and in the course of exactly an hour, it only charged up to 31%. that's 7% in 60 minutes = 1% every 8 minutes. and i use the cable that comes with the phone.

overall experience: as a regular person, not an expert, not a computer fan etc... this phone hasn't given me any new things, or improved in almost any way what i had in the s10e. i feel like the only thing i've noticed is the smoothness of a brand new phone vs a 3year old phone with tons of pics, apps in there which isn't really a point for the s22 because that's the purpose of buying a new phone. but even with barely 3 months of use, it still has its moments of running slow and bugging itself. 

as i said in the begging of the post, i feel like i (my parents) wasted 700‚Ç¨ and that i'm going to be stuck with this crap the next 3-5 years. if anyone out here has had the same experience as me, please share it so that way i know that i'm not alone or crazy. and if your experience with the s22 has been the complete opposite of this, share it too and hopefully give me tips on how i can get 100% of s22."

"how to enable cast support in media output switcher (one ui 5.1) the one ui 5.1 changelogs specifically called out ""**media output for wi-fi speakers**"" feature stating: *""if you want to continue listening to music on wi-fi speakers via spotify connect and built-in chromecast, just open media output from the quick access toolbar, not from the music app""*

but after getting the galaxy s23+ running one ui 5.1 i was disappointed when i first tried to switch playback from my phone to google home speakers using the 'media output' button in notification shade. it showed all my google cast devices, but it took several seconds to switch output to them and it didn't have any of the rich cast experience with album art and song information, just showed text 'default media receiver' or something.

but tonight i accidently discovered a non-obvious setting page where you can change it from what appears to be miracast mirroring, to actually use the google cast protocol. apps need to be updated to support it, but it works great! think it's only youtube and youtube music at the moment.

**instructions (screenshots here:** [**https://imgur.com/a/hg8qemp**](https://imgur.com/a/hg8qemp)**)**

1. click on 'media output' in notification shade
2. click the 'gear' in top-right
3. click on wi-fi speaker playback preference
4. select 'casting' to use google cast instead of the default 'mirroring'

"we need bypass charging for the entire os and not just gaming! i have a tab s8 ultra and i love it. i have a powerful laptop but, for daily drive i use the tab, as it is ""smaller"". you know, samsung recently came up with charging bypass for games, which i always wanted for my laptop, for years!!. i always though, why the f not they don't just bypass charging. let me have the option to use internal battery as ups. if the electricity cut, use the battery, but don't charge it, until its under (i don't know) 30%. you would think, in this era, it would be a piece of cake for companies, but for some reason, they just don't do it.

and finally, finally, a company did it. but just for gaming??? dude, these phones and tablets have dex mode! make the charge bypass for the entire os. you can hide it under some deeper settings if you don't trust ""not-so-tech-savvy"" users messing up thier tablets and blaming it on you, but do it please. hell, make it void warranty if you so wish to, but make it available to me. i beg of you. you would increase my interaction with the tablet and phone 10 folds. and who knows maybe some other companies follow your footprint on this.

i am writing this here, on the hopes that someone somewhat important in the company sees this, however low it is. i really would love a this to happen."

"my experience with s23 ultra, coming from pixel 7 pro let me start with the problems i had with my pixel 7 pro, which pushed me to get the s23 ultra.

as someone who is constantly trying to capture videos of my cats all day long, p7 pro was just not a great device. don't get me wrong, if the lighting was good, videos were decent. but most of my indoor shots had a lot of noise. evening and night time videos were average at best unless i had got some good lighting setup.

another issue i had was overheating and battery life, if i was shooting 4k videos, the battery just didn't last as long. editing videos on the phone wasn't that great either... tensor's subpar performance really made editing slower and the device would just get hot quickly. i saw that warning multiple times where it would say that the device is too hot to continue shooting and it had barely been 5 mins of 4k 30fps recording.

i came from iphone 13 pro before p7 pro so all of these issues with video recording and performance annoyed me a lot. i didn't want to go back to apple ecosystem because let's just say that i got bored from ios and wanted to experience android again.

i preordered s23 ultra on the launch day and have had the device for about a week now. i'm really happy with the performance and video quality so far. although i'm not a professional videographer, i have tried shooting some 8k clips of my cats, and i really like the end result, and even uploaded it to youtube. i've been able to record 4k 60 fps for longer than 10 mins, and have not really seen any overheating warnings so far. phone has just gotten warm once when i downloaded like 40gb of data over 5g network in one go.

video editing feels smoother and a better display with s pen really helps here with precision. i'm mostly editing for reels/shorts, and i've been very happy with the results so far. battery life is much better and i charge my device once every day.

only thing i would say that i miss from pixel 7 pro is shutter speed. samsung is not too bad but i definitely feel the difference and before anyone points out, i've already installed the camera assistant app and turned on the faster shutter setting. but that's just for shutter lag, not shutter speed.

if my cats are moving too much, i am mostly taking a video and not a picture, so the shutter speed factor doesn't bother me as much. s23 ultra is just a better overall camera experience for me.

i don't do any gaming on my phone so i can't say much about in that area.

overall, i'm a happy s23 ultra user.

did any of you come from pixel 6/7 series devices? if yes, what were the key reasons to upgrade to s23 series and how has your experience been so far?"
"samsung s22 ultra sporadic connection to network causing dropped calls my 6 month old s22 ultra worked great at first. last couple days i all of sudden started not connecting to network getting a (x) by the bars or having bars but no connection. it work for a bit than out of nowhere cuts off calls, can't make calls, data buffering, restart phone works then later same. tech support switched to 3g same thing, switched to esim card same thing, reset network settings same thing, cleared cache same thing. after 3 hours on with tech support and a day later with no resolution we came to conclusions it's not networking issue and its issue with phone, because my brother line (iphone) was working fine in the same household. this seems like a issue with samsung s22 series with my search on online communities like reddit. there's many how to fix videos on youtube. seems like samsungs needs a update it's hardware for this issue. t-mobile was pretty great getting me credits and warranty claim. unfortunately the phone is back ordered so i'm using a note 10 for next week or so."

"pre-order delayed again! possibly until april!!! üì¢ i have seen people getting their s23 ultras and pre-ordered the same as i did.  my fiancee and i pre-ordered our s23 ultras on 2/07/23 and got a notification it was expected to ship 2/17/23.  when the ship date came around it changed to 2/20/23-2/26/23.  then to 2/27/23-3/03/23.  now it says 3/21/23-4/05/23!!!  what the hell is happening?  i have never had this happen before when pre-ordering a phone.

is anyone else experiencing this level of delay?

note: we pre-ordered from t-mobile after switching from verizon.  i ordered green and she ordered black.  


  
update: after calling t-mobile every single day, our phones arrived today.  still no explanation as to why it was delayed, or why we got notifications of an april delivery date.  either way i am happy to have it now.  anyone else who has theirs delayed just bug the ever living sh\*t out of your carrier and maybe yours will show up early too."

"close to 9 hours of screen on time with the s23 ultra. so i was undecided whether to upgrade to the s23 ultra after it was announced. my s21 ultra was in pretty good shape (aside from a cracked back) 

never had any stuttering problems. never was sluggish. i didn't even manage to fill up the 256gb capacity within 2 years of use. 

but, after a couple of weeks contemplating, i decided to pull the trigger and get the s23 ultra.

to be honest, there's not a massive difference between the two phones that hits you in the face. the jump didn't feel anywhere as massive as it did when i went from the s9 plus to the s21 ultra. 

except for one aspect. battery life. i had just gotten close to 9 hours of sot with wifi and bluetooth both on. 

i mostly browsed reddit, an hour in a half of youtube, about 2 hours of gaming and some social media browsing.

this obviously isnt the heaviest of loads, but its the same routine i did with my s21 ultra, and that phone only lasted me about 6 hours, 7 the most.

i just wanted to share to you guys how the s23 ultra's battery holds up to usage mentioned above"
"samsung a53 5g vs s21fe vs s23 plus hey everyone, my dad loves my new s23 ultra and wants a new phone aswell  he currently has an a32 5g and wants to upgrade to something faster and nicer.  i upgraded to an s23 ultra from an s20 fe and got my mom an a14 5g from an a5 (2017). i don't think an s23 plus would honestly benefit him. firstly, it's super expensive, and he uses his phone for basic things ( web browsing, youtube, news, etc, ). but, him sacrifice everything for us i want to reward him with something nice.  my options are either the a53 5g (i looked at the a52 but the overall performance for the a53 is better) or the s21 fe, which is honestly super fast or the s23 plus. what is the best bang for the buck?"
"my experience after 1 week from an iphone 12 pro max i recently switched from the iphone 12 pro max and made a post about my switch and some folks said i will be back to using an iphone after and that i am in a honeymoon phase and blah blah blah. well one week later, i have never been happier about making the switch. this has been my experience so far after a week.

battery life: i started out with a decent  sot of around 5 hours. i have to say this is not really bad and as someone who works a lot and does not mind charging my phone once or twice a day, sot is sufficient for me. but i decided to see if i could push it further. so i decided to optimize my phone and here's how i did it:

1) i never charge the phone when the phone is hot. this is very important even than turning on to protect the battery.

2) i also realized adaptive brightness was overestimating the brightness i needed. so i set up modes and routines for the times i get home and around the times i sleep. around the time i get home, my at home mode sets the brightness to 4% which is more than enough for me. around the time i sleep, i have a routine set to turn off the phone if i plug the charger in to keep the phone cool and it also turns to protect the battery on to keep the phone's battery from stress overnight.

3) i also make sure to close apps i am not using anymore so the ram doesn't try to keep it open + ram uses a significant amount of battery.

after doing this sot went from 5 hours to 9-11 hours depending on the use which involved watching netflix(the screen is so good lol), using social media, reading, etc.

camera: 

the camera out of the box was great but it somehow didn't process some pics properly imo. but somehow it's like it got better overnight. the pics coming out of the phone are crazy good now not even kidding. some portraits shots  i took the other day of my kid look like they were professionally photographed. i can't explain what i did to improve the camera so much but one thing i noticed is that the more lighting the better. also being stable when taking a photo really helps. won't decide to go into shutter lag because that's a whole post of its own.

other:

apps run smoothly with like one lag because i have labs turned on (which they did mention could cause some lags), spen has been amazing been using it more times than i can count, pop out the pen, write something on aod, pin it, and never forget.

 review after a week:  i still think this is the best phone out there. with all the features it provides. there are many other things that i could go on and on about the phone but that will make this post too long. not saying it's perfect, i don't expect it to be and after one week it's one of the best purchases i have made in a while.

ps: one thing i really dislike about the phone is samsung emojis. pure shit. thank god android is highly customizable. i currently use iphone emojis on my s23 ultra. please leave any more tips that can help me better optimize my phone. thanks"
"s23u zoom transition delay/lag i just got my s23u today. just noticed that the transition between the lenses when zooming (.6x> 1x> 3x > 10x) has a bit of delay/lag. does anyone experience this with their unit? not sure if this an issue or normal with their ultra series devices since this is my first time using samsung after a long time. thank you in advance.

edit: here's a sample [clip](https://imgur.com/gallery/wa1wjfo) of the delay as well as a warping effect when zooming in from .6x to 1x"

"can samsung stop messing with routines? anyone knows where i can post ""feedback"" for samsung to read?

i have 1 single routine, which is ""night time"". set to turn on at 12am-9am, which will trigger a bunch of stuff (dnd, night filter, etc.).

previously on oneui 4, when it was just ""routines"", i was able to just use a quick toggle to disable all routines if i decide that i don't want my ""night time"" routine to be running at say 2am, then toggle it again to turn it on when i want it back on.

then with oneui 5, they made it ""modes & routines"", and the quick toggle stopped working. so i had to go into the modes & routines app to disable/enable the routine whenever i want to.

now with oneui 5.1, they once again messed with it. if i disable the routine when it's running, i can't re-enable it for some reason.

this is so frustrating, it was working fine in oneui 4, why did they add modes and screwed everything up."
"fold4 vs 23ultra display resolution i just received my fold 4 and i'm...kind of disappointed. i had watched a lot of video comparisons and reviews so i knew what i was getting into and wanted a mini tablet, but i feel like the display resolution on both screens is worse than my s10+. i don't know why?

does the 23 ultra have the same screen resolution? 

i know i should have compared both in person but i recently had surgery so it wasn't an option :(

don't know if i should return my fold4 or try and get used to it."

"repurposing my s10 - ideas and suggestions? hi all,

recently, i made the switch from my trusty samsung galaxy s10 to the newer, more advanced s23 ultra. while i love my new device, i couldn't help but notice that my s10 is still in great condition and fully functional, except for its battery life. so, i've been thinking about ways to repurpose it and make the most out of it.

i'm curious to hear how other people have repurposed their older smartphones. have you found any creative uses for your old devices? maybe you've integrated them into a work desk setup or found a way to use them as a security camera or music player.

personally, i'm considering using my s10 as a dedicated music player or a bedside clock with an alarm feature. i've also heard of people using their old devices as a home security camera, a remote control for their smart home devices, or even as a backup phone in case of emergency.

if anyone has any other suggestions or ideas, i would love to hear them. it would be great to repurpose my s10 in a way that adds value to my daily routine and reduces e-waste.

thanks in advance for your input!"

samsung unveils exynos modem with support for 2-way communication over satellite 
"samsung customer service just wanted to put this out there. i'm in a bunch of different subreddits related to samsung and their products. i am constantly seeing people say something to the effect of ""great products but the worst customer service of any company"". 

i've been using their products almost exclusively for the last 10 years and am not the easiest customer in terms of expectations. meaning i'll send my phone in for a repair/service more than a few times over the course of that time. i have never had a bad experience with them. my issues always get solved with minimal headache. and i would even say dealing with them is almost always a pleasant experience. there was only one occasion where i was almost let down. last year, after 4 or 5 months of ownership, i sent in my z fold 3 to get the main display replaced as it had started to develop little cracks down the center of the crease. but the main display did have accidental damage on it that i caused within the first week of ownership. (a few dead pixels) but the two were not related. after i sent in the phone, they basically said it wouldn't be covered under warranty and they would need $500 to replace the display.  i called samsung after seeing that email and complained about how the two issues are unrelated and the agent said that she would try to see if she can get that point across and get the screen replaced under warranty. i wasn't expecting much after we got off the phone since i had been hearing so many people complain about their customer service. anyway, i got an email a few hours later stating that the repair was made under warranty and the phone was being overnighted to me.

since this post is much longer than i had anticipated, i won't explain the pleasant experience i had with them over the past few days. just know that as somebody who deals with samsung customer service at least once a year, i have never been let down. and i would even say that of all the companies i have dealt with, samsung, in my experience, has had by far the best customer service."

"s23 ultra battery life loss hello guys,

i have new s23u and battery life and sot were awesome from beginning - 7+h of sot using 4g/5g only during 2 days. but lately, that changed and i can't get on 4 hours of sot during one day with same usage. i suddenly lost around 3 hours of sot without any issue visible, same apps, same usage, same places. 

i have no idea what to do, i tried reset, but it didn't help. during 14 days, i sadly managed to get to place where battery was under 10% twice. could that damage the battery and cause the battery life loss?

anyone noticed similar changes?

thanks for help."

"s23 ultra: does the s-pen colour match your phone? hi all, i've had my s23 ultra for almost a week now and am super happy about my device. i absolutely love it! however, and this might be nitpicking, i know, i noticed that the s-pen does not match my device. when purchasing my device, i was in doubt between green and lavender. ultimately, i liked the green more so ordered that one (the 512gb version). however, upon receiving my device, i noticed that the top of the s-pen is black, not green. i checked the samsung website again and i can see a green top on the s-pen there, which i like much more. i contacted samsung and they asked me to send them pictures of my s-pen and the pictures from the website. they will get back to me later.

now i'm left wondering. am i the only one with the wrong colour? here you can see what i am talking about: https://imgur.com/a/t8oynr2

is this the case for other colours too? it's super weird because when i look up pictures online, the s-pen tip colour always matches the phone."

"s23 ultra's wifi problem seems to happen only on wifi 6 routers; no issues if using wifi 5 so like many people, i had the issue of my 23 ultra getting the ""connected without internet"" error when connected to my wifi 6 router (tp-link ex221-g2u), forcing the phone to default to mobile data (thank god i have 160gb a month).

suspecting it had something with the wifi 6 protocol, i swapped back to my old wifi 5 router. the phone has since maintained the connection for more than 24 hours, where before it would drop the wifi 6 connection within an hour or two.

it's my only wifi 6 device; all my other wifi 5 devices connect just fine to the wifi 6 router (defaulting to the wifi 5 protocol). none of the other setting tweaks shared by others seem to work.

does anyone know if there is a way to force the s23 ultra to operate solely on the wifi 5 5ghz protocol, through a wifi 6 router?

edit: added my exact router model. also, managed to disable 802.11ax (wifi 6) on my router so it defaults to 802.11ac (wifi 5), and it's been very stable so far. but it's just a workaround for now and not a true fix because those of us with this problem cannot use our phones to their advertised potential."

 samsung s8 lite sm-x700 wifi 8/128gb graphite

the specs are:
- processor: octa-core (1x3.00 ghz cortex-x2 & 3x2.50 ghz cortex-a710 & 4x1.80 ghz cortex-a510) ( here i had some doubts is this the snapdragon 8 gen 1? )

- storage 128gb
- battery 8000mah
- cameras: 13mp 6mp back, 12mp front
- 11 inch screen

he gives 2 years warranty and i immagine the s pen comes with the tablet.
if im not mistaken there shouldn be a charger.

"s20+ (and 13 pro max) owner, looking at s23+/u i went to the store to hold each of them in my hand, i can't talk about the performance or the camera at this point, so i will just limit my comments to the feeling of the phones on your hand.

**s20+**  
i just love the feeling. mine has a case because i don't want to break if if i drop it, but without the case it's the most comfortable phone i ever had. size is perfect, rounded edges are very comfy to hold. if it had dynamic refresh and better camera, it would be perfect.

**iphone 13 pro max**  
i have this because of work. i hardly use it because the flat edges/sides are so uncomfortable to hold in my hands. plus it's extremely big and heavy. maybe i'm biased because i don't like apple products, but i would very much prefer a smaller iphone, can't really understand why someone would want the bigger version of the phones besides to have the best.

**s23+**  
i so much wanted to like it. i don't care about the s-pen at all, so my first thought was getting the s23+, although i would love to have the same screen (1-120hz) and cameras as the ultra. but the flat edges... feels exactly like the iphone 13 pro max... too uncomfortable to hold! and the fact that it feels mid-flagship due to the features... i don't know. imo the plus and u should each share more similarities in terms of hardware, except the shape and s-pen.

**s23u**  
i was surprised, it is as big as my s20+ without a case. it means phones are not getting bigger, but a bit smaller. i'm not a fan of the squared shape, but the edges are soft/rounded like the s20+ which makes it comfy to hold in your hands. and because it's not actually bigger, for my hands it's perfect. i just dislike that it has the s-pen (could live without it), and the overall squared shape is not my cup of tea.

i'm not sure which one to buy. i'm really torn between the plus and ultra. so much that i'm considering skipping this generation completely. my s20+ (march 2020) still feels good as new. i like to change my phone every 2-3 years but can't find enough reasons yet.

any other s20+ owners willing to share their experiences with the s23 lineup?"
"so i just got my s23 ultra 1tb for an insane price directly from samsung today was the big day, i sold my iphone 14 pro max and picked up a s23 ultra but things went better than expected. 

i went to the samsung store and asked for a 512gb version, they didn't have any laying around but they did have the 1tb version. i asked them how much it would cost me and i was shocked.   
so rn in europe they have a sale going on where you can get the 1tb variant for the price of a 512gb variant, this would mean it would cost ‚Ç¨1579, the guy who helped me then asked if i had a phone i could trade in and i told him i just sold my iphone but i had an old lg g6 with broken screen with me as my backup. he said he could take it in and provide another ‚Ç¨200 discount if i did that (for a phone that's worth absolutely nothing). then he asked me if i were a student (i am) which was another ‚Ç¨157 discount. 

all in all, i got the phone for ‚Ç¨1222 which is insane! i can't express how happy i am! just wanted to share this information for anyone still on the fence, the time is now!"
"galaxy buds resell for nothing some of you have surely noticed that almost any model of galaxy buds resell on places like ebay for literally nothing. a pair of buds pro are $38 on ebay. i saw the buds 2 pro for $50. why do they resell for so little? the only thing i can really come up with is people don't like them but got them for free or they're flat out unpopular, but i quite like my buds pro, so i'm not sure"
"s23 light-mode experiences going to keep it brief as i can. testing light mode on the base s23 which claims ~30-40% power/heat savings for ~10% performance off the top on the s23.

**performance:** i cannot force a scenario where i notice the 10% performance hit. i've even tested it with skyline emulator (something that pushes the soc to the max, yet samsung does not detect as a game so light mode appears to be intact).

**battery:** a definite boost but its within a range that might seem placebo but seems a bit too good to be just that. ~5-10% increase which on the s23 which already had solid battery life is actually a good bit of time. i think the impact to battery life with dex usage and while multitasking in general was pretty noticeable 

**heat:** biggest benefit by miles. android auto with gps (wired and wireless) ends up ice-cold, dex and multitasking (was already not so bad) doesn't even warm it up, really it's only tasks that kick the gpu on that will heat up the phone anymore.

**conclusion / my 2-cents:** if you can't specify a need for the max clockspeeds (excluding gaming when light mode disables itself) then you should absolutely be using light mode, or at the very least try it out for a few days. outside of geekbench i absolutely never used/felt the top 10% of this sd8g2(fg).. but i definitely feel these efficiency benefits."

"smartthings/location+wifi scanning/modes and routines so i'm moving into the new age and i guess i'm questioning how things work when i switch to automations for home appliances/networking etc.

what i want to do is have my phone switch networks when i'm in/out the house (using connect/disconnect from network as trigger) and turn off/reverse location and mobile data toggles. this i already have configured.

but here is the big question. in order to have this work autonomously, i'll probably need to have gps, bluetooth, wifi and mobile data all turned on when i'm outside... right?

i've noticed there are settings for certain apps pertaining location scanning (high and low precision) and also wifi/bluetooth scanning even if they're both turned off.

...how does this all mesh together? do i need to run bt/wifi/gps all day?   
because that's probably a deal-breaker.   
but if there's some automation i can write, or if low-usage background processes are adequate to determine my location for using smart home 'things', i'd love to know.

(on a side note; i'm getting a watch5lte as promotional gift, and i'd like to have find-my-phone services working optimally too. would that necessitate having these services on all day, or no?)  


thanks redditors! :)"
"hello everyone i have been researching for a lot but can't decide between the iphone 13(not pro max or pro) or the samsung s22 ultra i watched a lot of videos on both and a lot of comparisons and most of them contradict, in the future i will be getting a macbook for work if that matters for the apple ecosystem but can't i use samsung phone with a macbook just fine?, i'm just asking for some pros and cons, and most importantly how long each phone is gonna last, not as in battery life but as in dropping it on face side or scratching it etc."
"is it just me or is the camera on the base s23 actually terrible? want to move off the iphone. finally europe gets snapdragon. pre order s23. physically, the device is amazing. great display, great speakers, great size, can remove almost all the bloatware. 
but the camera‚Ä¶is terrible.

***12 mp photos*** - great in good lighting. grainy and blurry as shit indoors.

***50 mp photos*** - wtf. takes 5 seconds to process and turns up hdr and saturation to a 100 with scene recognition off. this can be resolved by installing the camera assistant and setting the shutter speed to prioritise speed over quality and turning on the scene recognition. when you prioritise speed, it doesn‚Äôt apply the post processing. but the hit to quality is noticeable.

***shutter lag*** - i didn‚Äôt think this would be an issue. but it is. tried to sort this out via the camera assistant, but still blurry photos of my kid. i did a side by side comparison by taking photos from both, the s23 and my iphone and the iphone took 12 photos while the s23 took 6.
the lag is unbearable. 

my wife tried to take some photos from the car and they were all blurry and the focus was all over the place. 
never happens with the iphone. 

**expertraw** - 

***50 mp***- horrible over processed , green tinted photos. akin to non raw 50 mp ones. it‚Äôs supposed to be raw ? with little to no processing. it‚Äôs especially horrible at night. raises all shadows, saturation and hdr 100%

https://youtu.be/mvro53abppk

***12 mp*** - fine again. 

tried toggling auto hdr in settings. didn‚Äôt help. 

***video*** - 

always starts off choppy, but smoothes out eventually. 
also notice the lights in the videos taken at night to be flickering a lot. 

all this over processing also means i never know how a photo is going to turn out. i‚Äôm looking at something and expect to take a photo of what i see. 10 seconds later, you have a photo that is over processed to shit with it looking nothing like what i see. 

maybe i got a dud. 

i have raised a return and will be keeping my iphone. 
saw a bunch of reviews praising the cameras but am left disappointed. 
would get a pixel if google started selling them officially in my country.
i guess i‚Äôm stuck with apple till then.

edit - added a link to a video where you can see the insane processing / colour shifts on the 50 mp shots."
"how nice of samsung the day the galaxy book ultra 3 ships, to change the date from feb 24th-march 17th  

i  contacted chat and they gave me a $25 credit from an arabic chat agent  that was reading scripts and automated text(they came in way too fast to  be typed to a human).   dude, you're pushing my order back 23 days.     that seriously is worth $200 for this screwup.

if  i have to wait this long to get my galaxy book ultra, i'm just going to  cancel and go with another company, that doesn't have shipping delays.    i did not have this issue with my s23 ultra, got it a day before  street date.

i  know all of the youtubers have an nda to post nothing before the  ""street date"" of february 24th, when consumers have to wait until march  17th giving ""high demand as an excuse""   i'm sorry, that's not how  business works, you don't tell them the day before, your order is  shipping a month later."
"how frequent is it that customers who send trade-in phone in good condition and samsung sends email it was cracked and that they will charge card? i wrapped my s22u (trade-in for s23u) phone in soft anti-scratch wrap, then packed it in box it came in, the  wrapped box with the wrap samsung uses for shipping phone, then placed it in fedex box. yet i received email from samsung claiming phone was cracked and i will be charged. luckily, i took photos from fedex counter of all this including phone condition and turning it on. that saved me from the additional charge after sending these to samsung as evidence. and then i read online many complaining of similar charges when they say they shipped good device ... many did not have evidence. and now i wonder how common is it that samsung claims cracked trade-in when it is not."
"samsung delays and pricing discrepancies https://imgur.com/a/bmcgxfc

"please bring back wingtips for the buds or a wingtip design. i am one of those people who cant fit the earbuds. ive had the ogs with wingtip fittings, the bud 2 pros i just got with my s23, and whatever those buds were when they first got rid of tips. none of them work. im 6ft tall and use these things when im working out. these buds are not designed with durability in mind. ive destroyed 2 buds because they fell out of my ear and cant survive a 6ft drop. samsung please stop with this apple thing where you guys care about how a product looks vs how it works with real world use.  i had this same issue with the z fold series constantly aiming to get thinner instead of getting a larger battery and internal s pen. sleek isnt always the way. i remember back when you guys sold rugged ugly versions of the s series for people who activities put their devices at risk. i miss the old samsung man. love some of you guys products but as a former fold user and a customer on his last pair of buds ever, i wish you'd find your way. i dont know why i can't fit your buds. my old jabras were great until someone stole them, but your buds were a great option until this direction."
"is doing an exchange a brand new phone? (uk) my s23 ultra may be a little defective and they suggested i do an exchange..if i do, do they send a brand new, sealed untouched deviced?

i don't want that from a phone..i don't want them to open it, test it, then give it.. just want a new untouched phone as if i bought it from the website the first time around

"are there galaxy s23 ultra 'must-use' features that i might have overlooked when i ported from my note 10? i've had a note 10 since about the time it released in 2019, and it finally bit the bullet and i upgraded to the s23 ultra (i can't live without an s-pen). when it got my new phone setup it ported over all the settings from my note 10 and all the apps, which was a wonderfully easy transition.

however, everything looks and feels more or less the same. that's fine, but i want to make sure i'm not missing anything. when i moved from the note 2 to a s8 edge, it added the edge panel which was annoying at first  but eventually grew on me.  then the note 10 added google assistant and some other features.  i never used bixby, but i know some people love it.

i want to make sure there aren't 'must use' features on the note 23 that i've overlooked by porting over my phone settings from the note 10.  i don't really live in the phone world in terms of new releases and things like that.  i just needed a phone and the s23 ultra came out at the right time.

so are there cool tricks, cool features, etc. that i need to make sure i'm not missing out on?  things that you've discovered on your new phones that made you say ""wow, i need to tell the world about how kick ass this is""?  i'd love to hear all of it so i can get the most use out of my new phone."

"iphone 13 pro to s23 ultra anyone make the switch from ios to android? i currently have the 13 pro but i‚Äôm growing so tired of iphone‚Äôs‚Ä¶. the signal is spotty at best in any fringe areas and it‚Äôs always switching to 3g and the phone is basically useless. i have had a s23 in my hands side by side with the iphone and it had zero issues with signal while the iphone just sits and waits. i am not tied into apples ecosystem as i only have a watch which i hardly wear. besides sending the odd video over text, i could care less about imessage. just curious if anyone made the switch and regretted it? i always see videos and read about people switching on youtube but that is usually click bait and or a crock of crap as they still have the other phone to go back to. looking for some genuine input from anyone that may have made the switch knowing there is no going back for 2 years. i always used android since gingerbread but switched when the ip 7 came out and have been with apple ever since. don‚Äôt care about 5 years support or resale value as they are both mute points and irrelevant in my case. thanks in advance for any input!!"

"s21 ultra or s22 ultra 2nd hand hello, i've been looking to upgrade from my huawei p30 lite for some time and thse 2 phones are the main options(open to more), both of them 2nd  hand since in my country full price brand new cost almost as much as the new s23 ultra. s21 ultra is about 600 euros for the 256gb version and the s22 ultra is about 700 for the 128gb version. 

is the battery life on the s22 ultra exynos really that bad or even worse than the s21 ultra? this is my main reason for opting more for the s21 ultra instead of the s22 ultra.

i've read lots of opinions and experiences but i wanted to ask the question myself.

i'm looking to hold onto this phone for a year or so until the next iphone / s24 ultra is released and then decide on one of the best phones.

for now i just want to get rid of this huawei since its barely working anymore."

recently i was in a hotel that provided a tablet in each room. out of curiosity i plugged in the charging cable. instant reliable fast charging. i has also noticed a phone shop that sold ""charging cable"". tried his cable and also instant fast charging. bought it and had him dispose of my ""original samsung cable""

i guess samsung designed the s8 too perfectly so any mechanical aberration made the cable longer fit. and since cable have been designed with a slightly shorter connector si they fit anyway?"

"samsung shop (india) really messed up my order! so i pre-ordered the s23 ultra along with the grip case, watch 5 pro, buds 2 pro and screen protector on 5th. the watch 5 pro had a delivery date of 7th feb. i scheduled the buds 2 pro to deliver on 16th feb. other items being a pre-order, it was expected to start shipping from 17th feb. weird thing about the case and the screen protector was that it's shipping was to start from 17th but delivery date was for 16th!!

so here's the day by day timeline so far on what followed.
7th feb - as expected the watch 5 pro got delivered. i didn't have an android at the time to set it up since i was still in the iphone.

16th feb - my buds 2 pro was supposed to be shipped by now and it was still showing confirmed on the app. whole day passed and they were not delivered.

17th feb - my s23 ultra got shipped with a delivery date for 18th. but the grip case and screen protector were still not packed. same case with the buds as well. i called up samsung to enquire and they assured it will be delivered on 18th.

18th feb - got my phone and i was super excited. the whole day went in setting up the phone. during the later half i checked the app for status on the remaining 3 items and they were still not packed. i called up samsung again and now they were telling they will register a complaint. i told the guy why was a wrong commitment given and they had no answer. they told me it would be sorted it 24hrs. since i didn't have a case, i ordered a ringke case from amazon
 
19th feb - same status of order not packed. i got my ringke case though.
 
20th feb - i called up samsung again and they telling their teams weren't working on sunday so nobody was able to look at the issue.

21st feb - samsung finally started packing the order but split them into 3 different shipments.

22nd feb - recieved the grip case and screen protector. yet to receive the buds since it's delivery date is 23rd.

i think samsung forgot to place the order till i escalated to their support since i got no communication from them even if there was a delay. samsung didn't even have the courtesy to do that. the invoice dates found in my screen protector and case box are dated on 21st feb which means i dont think they have accounted for the pre-orders properly. overall a super disappointing first experience with samsung shop."

"a52 5g to s23 base? hello everyone, i can clearly see the hardware difference between my current mid range device and the base s23 model but i'm really curious about the difference in experience. 

sure i have shitty haptics, unusable night photography, video and no good zoom and a few software hiccups here and there. 

even compared to a s22u my friend has though, i wouldn't say the experience was of a different world. night photography even though way better, it was still a smartphone photo and unusable other than to send to a friend. same with the display,  it's just a bit better than mine. performance difference i couldn't really tell other than the phone being a bit snappier. i suppose the s23 base model won't be that much better than the s22u. 

am i missing some aspect of the flagship experience?
i use my phone only for social, youtube and emails/browsing. and my latest flagship was the nexus 5 which i loved.

"samsung's stupidest decision i got my s20 last year and have to say it's been a wonderful phone. very sleek, the camera works great and the phone is very powerful. have to say it's probably the best phone i've owned so far.

i was looking into some newer models though just window shopping to see any interesting features the newer phones have. until i found out samsung removed one of it's core features.

the micro sd slot. no phone past the 20 had a micro sd slot. like wtf? why? the micro sd slot is one of samsung's most useful features. i never cared what size phone i got because i always have a 128gb micro sd card that i've been using since my s7. 

i just think it's such a stupid thing to remove. out of all things to take out they take out the microsd slot? i don't want to use cloud based storage. 

it's been 3 generations and they haven't brought it back. so it's safe to say that the feature is gone for good. 

ik i'm probably ranting and that this has been discussed before. but man i'm pissed, idek what phone i'd use once i'm done with the s20. i plan to use this for another 2-3 years at least. but after that idk.

"camera assistant capture speed setting, unscientific comparison on effect on motion blur tl;dr it just adds noise

i hadn't really seen anyone post any sort of comparisons around this setting yet. while waiting in a line there was a dog wagging its tail at a pretty constant speed so i got to test if the capture speed setting does anything to minimize the motion blur problem. if anything the blur looks a litter worse to me under prioritize speed, but i think that's just from the dog being a bit closer. either way, it absolutely does not improve the issue significantly.

"why are t-mobile employees so slimy? i wanted to buy a samsung galaxy s23 through [samsung.com](https://samsung.com) using t-mobile as a carrier. i saw that for the 256gb version, the price was $859.99, and with taxes it went to roughly $923. i was about to buy it until i was directed to a webpage were i was given the option to upgrade my line, or add a new line. i wanted neither but that was not an option, plus i did not remember my t-mobile pin so i just exited and decided to go to buy it at a t-mobile store.

i arrive at the store and the sale almost gets finalized until the inform me that, with taxes, the price is $962. i ask why the price is higher than the website's price and they tell me that the 256gb version is $100 more expensive, whereas in the website it's only $60 more expensive. i cancel the deal and i go to another store to see if i can get a price that matches the website's. the representative at the other t-mobile location tells me that with taxes, the price is $923. they also tell me that they cover the shipping and $923 is the final figure, hence matching the webiste's price. i agree to the deal and 40 minutes later i see a charge on my credit card that is $962. i call customer support and they tell me that there is a $35 support fee that comes with upgrading my line, which is mandatory. i did not see it on the website because i never got past that webpage.

in hindsight, the first representative lied as well by making it seem that the extra charge was due to samsung, not t-mobile. ironically, his lies are what ruined the deal for him. the second representative was more shrewd in her craft and got me. i would have paid the support fee regardless, but price obfuscation gave me a bad taste in my mouth. next time i go to an electronic store, i will ask them questions and try out their product with no intention of buying it from them and buying it online instead. no need to act in good faith when the other side is not either."
samsung galaxy s23 ultra review: the best ever? 
"samsung phone shuts off randomly, no response from any button combination 
so my dad has a j5 pro 2017 and right now it just decided it‚Äôs shutting off (yes the phone is charged) and no matter what we press it‚Äôs not doing anything, and yes, i do know every software button combo but none are working. this isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs first time, this literally happened more than 20 times in a span of a year. we tried everything - even resetting the phone.
it just stays off until it feels like working again, could be an hour, 2 days, or a minute it doesn‚Äôt have any limit.

can‚Äôt be a hardware issue because guess what?? my mom has the same exact phone model and her‚Äôs does the same shit too. it‚Äôs starting to get infuriating. i searched everywhere with no avail, please help."

"fb messenger selfie pictures way too smoothened currently using a base s23, when i take a selfie using the in-app camera, the picture is super smoothened like way too much, the picture is absolutely terrible. it's even worse than on my previous phone (oneplus 7t).  
what's weird is that using the rear camera the picture comes out pretty good but the selfie camera, dear lord my face looks like a doodle!

"bixby text answer settings question does anyone knows if it's possible to set bixby text answer only to phone calls not in phone book, or is it one of those ""google patented so no"" things? this'd be close enough to phone screening (and potentially better as text is editable) for me to actually use the bixby thing."
"ship date for s23 ultra i pre-ordered my phone the day of the samsung event (lavender 512gb via at&t with a couple bundles). originally it was set for a 2/17 delivery date, which then moved to 2/22 - 2/23 when that date approached. the end of last week moved it to 2/28 and now today has it set for 3/14. is anyone else experiencing similar delays? is there anything i can do but wait?? i know there are bigger problems in life but waiting a month extra for nearly a $2000 order is aggravating to say the least."
"is my s22 ultra's battery acting normal? i got this phone 1 week ago, the dual sim snapdragon gen 1 model, im on android 13 one ui 5.1, the ai has also analyzed my usage pattern and it says 10 hours left when my battery is 100%, the battery drains so quickly like i don't even feel like i have a 2022 flagship phone, the battery even lasts longer on my older a series devices. i started with 84% at 8am in the morning and almost constantly used it until 12:30 pm, i went through tiktok, chrome, snapchat and a little bit of instagram and took non 108mp photos and two 30 second videos with fhd 60 fps on my camera app. and with mobile data on(4g+ or 4.5g mode), the phone reached 20% at 12:30 (4:30 hours)

also when my phone reaches 30 or 20% and i check the battery usage, it says that the highest one was tiktok and it only used 7% of my battery, instagram 5% and camera app 3%, and then a few other apps and background apps which were under 1%, like 0.5 or something like that

here are some of my settings and preferences on avg daily basis:

battery health: good/normal 5000 | avg daily usage: vpn is always enabled, whatsapp, browsing, spotify, tiktok, instagram, taking photos, and a little bit of youtube |dark mode: on | wifi: off, bluetooth: off, nfc: off, uwb: off | mobile data: on, 80% of the times | sim card mode: dual sim, on one of them 5g is enabled(that sim card uses 4g usually and sometimes 4.5g | sync: on | dolby atmos: on(auto mode) | brightness: at 75 or 80% without extra brightness or adaptive brightness mode | motion smoothness: 120hz adaptive | screen res: fhd(2316 x 1080) | no themes or extra messy apps to make phone slower or battery worse | storage: 125gb left | available and free memory: usually 6 or 7gb | ram plus: 4gb | device protection off | battery auto optimisation(auto restart): on |google assistant: on (with voice feature) | bixby: off |"

"s23 ultra is a bit warm with light usage hey there,
i've been using the s23 ultra for 4 days now and i have to say i'm a bit surprised at how warm the phone gets. it's set on light performance and i only use it on apps like youtube, reddit, twitter etc.. i have also disabled ram+ and 5g. granted, the phone is not hot but i can definitely tell that that it's heating a little bit.
my one+ 6t didn't get as warm as far as i remember.
is it something that i should be preoccupied with? 
on a side note the battery, while good, is nothing to write home about. i barely made it to the 8hr mark. is the phone still learning my patterns?
thanks."
"45w samsung charger (t4510xbegus vs ep-ta845xbegus) edit: update! i received my 45w charger today and started charging with my s23u turned off at 4%. reached 100% within 35 minutes. :) very happy with the results.

just wanted to point out that the samsung 45w charger ([ep-t4510xbegus](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/45w-power-adapter-with-cable-ep-t4510xbegus/)) is very effective compared to the previous samsung 45w charger (ep-ta845xbegus).

the first was released in 2022 and is able to charge the s23u from 0-100% in under an hour. the second was released in 2019 and is the charger that is barely better than the 25w charger.

i'm posting this because i couldn't understand the difference between the two chargers on samsung's site, had to look on amazon to confirm, and felt like y'all could benefit from my findings. also, both were sold out during the pre-order period. so! make sure to get the ep-t4510xbegus version if you live in the us and buy one."

"s23 ultra - the little guy just won't die! here's the battery stats i got during my first 3 days with the phone after setting it up.

https://i.imgur.com/eyakn79.jpg

the phone is still learning my usage but so far, it's been impressive. everything is maxed out i.e. 120hz, wqhd but i kept the performance in light mode.

given the battery is so good, i actually turned off the option to display the battery percentage in the status bar because i'm not going be anxious with my usage and the fact that i know that the phone won't die on me.

this week, i'm going to do my usual debloating routines, same as what i've done with my s22 ultra.

"samsung fold phone holder for travelling hello, im going to use my fold 4 to record walking video while im travelling, 

im thinking to put the fold with a phone holder attached to a grip (mini tripod) so my hands are not strained for long video session holding directly to the fold.

i bought several phone holders from ulanzi and smallrig but they wont fit securely due the the fold thickness (almost 2cm), so whenever i try to shale them the phone will fall.

i also thinking to use a powerbank holder as it offers deeper clamp that suits the fold thickness but they (from smallrig) do not have the correct slot to make it as a phone holder (the slotted sideways).

anyone can help which brand and type to use?

thank you."

"pre orders are literally pointless. that's not even an exaggeration.

i pre-ordered an s23+ on 2nd feb. still have no actual eta as to when i'll get it.

what is the actual point of pre-ordering a device when you get it weeks after it's general release?
the entire purpose of pre-ordering is so that you can put yourself in front of the front of the queue on release day.

what's more is they try to act like online exclusive colours take longer. how? even if they were specifically made to order, it wouldn't take 3-4 weeks to assemble and ship. even if they were customised with engraving and things like that on top of assembly to order, that still wouldn't take that long.
it's a colour. literally a different casing around the same internals.

customer service are good for nothing other than summarising ""terms & conditions"", they don't help at all.

why provide the ability to pre-order when it's genuinely faster to drive to any 3rd party retailer and buy it on the release date.

to be clear: i'm in australia, i ordered the graphite colour, and i paid outright.

so they have $1700+ and literally cannot provide me with an indication as to when i'll receive the goods in exchange for the money they've had in their account for weeks.

how is this even legal?"

"galaxy book3 pro 360 review - an apple user's perspective i've had the galaxy book3 pro 360 for almost 3 weeks now, and i wanted to share my thoughts and answer your questions. 

as a point of comparison, my personal laptop is a 2021 14"" macbook pro. i'm also very deep in the apple bubble and was interested in how samsung's matching some of their integrations with its own ecosystem. 

disclaimers:

* this is a review unit loaned to me by samsung, but all thoughts are completely my own and haven't been run by anyone before posting.
* this is an engineering sample, so some of my comments may be fixed in final retail units. 
_________

# summary - 8/10

- build quality, display and keyboard are fantastic. 
- trackpad is massive, but some weird tracking inconsistencies let it down.
- spen is great if that's something you need. 
- battery is good. not outstanding, but good enough. 
- ecosystem is the best it's been, but a little inconsistent at times.
- speakers, webcam, fingerprint scanner are ok, but could definitely use some improvement. 

_________

# build quality - 9.5/10

* this thing is very solidly built. there's very little chassis flex or creaking. nothing feels like it's going to fall off or break. 
* only real gripe is with the screen. there's a little bit of flex because of how slim it is. it's not enough to bend while you're trying to open the laptop or anything, but it is enough that you can click the trackpad through the screen if you grip it hard enough in just the right spot. but again, i don't have a final retail unit, so take my experience with a grain of salt. 

# display - 9/10

* to my eye it looks significantly brighter than my mbp's screen.
* saturation feels like it's cranked up a little. i like it, but i don't know enough about color accuracy to make a judgement there. there are other color profiles you can choose in settings if that's more your preference. 
* black are deep thanks to oled, and it doesn't suffer from [light bloom](https://imgur.com/a/peiigdq) like my mbp does. the camera does exaggerate the effect a little, but it's still very noticeable in person. 
* 16:10 is a very welcome change. it does mean you have letterboxing, but the tradeoff for everyday use is worth it imo. 
* i'm not too fond of the rounded corners. it cuts into the ui a little, and while it's typically in title bars and the taskbar, it feels out of place. 
* there's a massive chin below the screen that makes it look cheap.
* the hinge is wobbly. unsure if this is just something with my unit, but it's something that really annoyed me while trying to use the laptop. 

# spen - 10/10

* there's practically zero latency when using the spen. 
* there's a good amount of friction when writing. it's not quite pen on paper, but it's far from the plastic on glass feeling that a lot of styluses fall into.
* the spen itself feels a little hollow. doesn't impact functionality at all, it just feels a little cheap in the hand. 
* this is very nitpicky, but the button on the side of the spen is on the rounded edge and i'd rather it were on the flat edge. 
* it mounts to some magnets on the back of the screen. it's ok if you're just looking for a place to keep it without it rolling away, but it's not staying on there in your bag. 

# keyboard - 10/10

* i **love** this keyboard. i recognize that i'm in the minority, but this reminds me a lot of apple's butterfly keyboard which was by far my favorite keyboard of all time as far as typing experience goes (durability is a whole other topic). 
* they keys are definitely on the shallower side of the spectrum. i don't have a way of accurately measuring it, but if i had to guess it's around 1 mm of travel. 
* despite the low travel, it maintains a fair bit of tactility. i never found myself guessing if i'd actually pressed a key or not. 
* the keys are a nice size with enough separation between them to not be an issue. 
* it has a numpad if you're into that, but it's [not a standard layout](https://i.imgur.com/coaffse.jpg). i found it a little frustrating to use because i kept missing the 0 and enter keys, but i'm sure you'd get used to it. 
* the keyboard deck is solid, i haven't noticed any flexing. the keys are also very stable, no noticeable wobbling. 

# touchpad - 6/10

* it's massive. there's no other way to put it. [here it is compared to an s23 ultra](https://i.imgur.io/sfpm9z4_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium). if youre' into large trackpads, this thing is fantastic. 
* the size does take a little bit of getting used to when you're typing. it does have decent palm rejection, but it's not perfect. there is a shortcut on the function row to disable the touchpad, which might be useful during longer typing sessions.
* good surface texture. 
* i had a weird issue where the first ~1 cm of any movement would be ignored. not sure if this is part of the palm rejection algorithm, but it's **very** annoying. i hope this can get fixed in a software update, it's easily the worst part of using this laptop. 
* windows gestures are still not as fluid as macos gestures. they're miles better than they were a few years ago, but it still feels like they're one step behind. 
* i wish this was a haptic trackpad. because of its size, the force you need to use to click varies wildly based on where you click. i may be spoiled by my mbp's trackpad, but being able to click anywhere with the same amount of force and feedback is very underrated. 

# speakers - 7/10

* they're loud enough and produce a clean sound, but they're not going to win any awards. i've definitely heard worse speakers out there, but i've also heard better. 
* there's next to no bass. 

# battery - 7/10

* it's enough to barely get through a workday with light use, but anything beyond that and you'll likely need to top up halfway through.
* as i'm typing this, i'm sitting at 68% with 4h 41m remaining. i've lost about 20% over the past hour and a half. 
* as a note, i did have my brightness cranked way up during my use; i'm sure being more conscious of your brightness would make the battery last significantly longer. 

# performance and heat - ?/10

* i haven't really had a chance to push this thing to its limits; my heavy workloads are enough to require dedicated workstations/clusters, which only leaves lighter everyday tasks for both this and my personal laptop. 
* i never felt this thing struggle, but that's not surprising with a light workload and a 13th gen i7-p. 
* this isn't a gaming machine, but a quick test in minecraft gave me roughly similar framerates as my m1 pro's gpu (~100-130 fps, default settings). rocket league on default settings was hovering around 40 fps. lighter titles should be playable, especially if you're willing to lower framerates, but this isn't the machine for you if you want to do any real gaming.   
* i may be spoiled by my mbp, but the book3 gets noticeably warmer and the fans kick on more frequently than my mbp. it's not to the point where it's interfering with anything, but it's something i noticed. during the few minutes i was testing framerates with minecraft, the book3 was blasting its fan from the moment the game loaded and the mbp didn't even have time to get warm. 
  * that being said, being able to just install anything without worrying about arm compatibility is freeing. windows has their translation layer, as does macos, but i try to avoid relying on it because a) there's a (small) hit to performance and battery and b) i don't expect the translation layers to stick around forever. 

# ecosystem - 8/10

* overall, i like what samsung's trying to do here. if i could move away from macos i'd be taking a hard look at samsung's ecosystem as a replacement. 
* they have alternatives for a lot of the major integrations apple has between their devices:
  * quick share vs airdrop
  * secondscreen vs sidecar
  * multi control vs universal control
  * phone link (yes, i know this isn't samsung specific) vs continuity
* some of these solutions are actually more functional. quick share lets you share via qr code or link so you can share with non-samsung devices. multi control lets you control your phone, not just your tablet. phone link isn't limited to samsung devices since it's a google/microsoft partnership. 
* my main gripe is that a lot of these alternatives have a little more friction than apple's solutions. for example, with multi control you have to open the app to connect to your other devices, where with universal control you just move your cursor over to the edge and it'll connect automatically as you cross over the edge.

# other

* **ports**. as much as i want to be live in a usb-c world, we're just not there yet, so **thank you**, samsung, for keeping one usb-a around. i do wish they'd placed the usb-c ports on both sides so you could choose which side you use for charging, but i was told that's a limitation with the daughterboards they use for the ports. 
* the fingerprint scanner isn't the best. it works, but it's hit and miss in my experience. 
* the webcam is nothing to write home about."

i've been thinking of getting the s23 ultra (currently using a pixel 6 pro), and my main concern is the lack of smooth animations. i tried the s22 ultra (8gen1) for a week, but found the animations worse than the pixel.

"i will never go for samsung if they again put exynos chipset in them after 3 months with s22u and almost 1 week with s23+ i definetely will say that i won't ever get again samsung smartphone if they decide to put exynos in this device in europe.

for sure i won't preorder it before testing and seeing exynos is better than sd which won't probably ever happen in history.

on s22u i had many problems, throttling on random apps. it was lagging when i compare it with s23+. if u see sot tests online it probably don't show the real exynos issues. i was using it while traveling by train and in my weak signal area on 4g. it was terrible how it was managing battery even if i implemented so many options that should help the battery.

i won't ever afford same price for a phone that ppl from another countries gets in better variant than me. i will probably switch to asus or pixel then or even back again to apple.

and to not let this topic to be just statement. do you think samsung will use again exynos in their s series phones after preorder success on s23 series? will you get again samsung if they will start again putting there exynos chipsets (of course if u are from area with exynos chipsets)?"

i can't post them but i took 3 photos of a wall with some photos and text at a distance. 12mp jpeg (4.22mb), 50mp jpeg (8.99mb) and 50mp raw (99.37mb). i punched in to maximum zoom (of 12mp jpeg) and found that the 50mp raw did not have near the detail or sharpness of the 50mp jpeg, and almost the same detail as the 4mb 12mp. what's the point of 100mb photos if they're not retaining the detail?"

"seeking advice on switching from iphone to samsung due to imessage issues hello everyone,

i'm hoping to get some advice on a problem i've been struggling with for a while now. i've been a lifelong iphone user and i'm heavily invested in the apple ecosystem, especially in imessage. however, i'm also a professional photographer and i've found that samsung's galaxy takes far superior photos, particularly indoors. as a result, i've been carrying around two phones for years, which has become a major inconvenience.

recently, i decided to make a switch to samsung galaxy s23u and commit to it permanently. however, i've been facing a significant issue with imessage. when i've tried to switch my sim card from iphone to samsung in the past, apple removed my information from their imessage database, but people who had my information stored in their phone were not able to receive my messages. this has caused me a lot of frustration and has even affected my work, as i need to communicate with clients and colleagues regularly.

as a professional, text messages are essential for my livelihood and i need to be sure that my messages are delivered without any issues. while i've tried using a ""hack app"" called beeper to get all my imessages onto my samsung, it's not a reliable method and it hinders the full functionality of texting and communicating. i've also tried swapping sim cards before, but apple does some shady things that prevent messages from being delivered properly.

i really want to make a permanent switch to samsung, but the imessage issue is making it difficult for me. while whatsapp is an option, not everyone uses it and it's impossible to get some people to change. i'm hoping someone can offer some helpful information, past experience, or a solution to this problem.

thank you for your help!

edit: i am aware of the ""de-register imessage number"" from apple's website. ive used that several times in the past, and, although it de-registers \*my\* number from imessage, \*other\* people's phones still do not, at times, receive my texts and their phones ""think"" that an imessage should be coming through."

my current one is an s20, but the battery is done for, the screen is cracked, the camera slow... i need a change

looking at the price to quality ratio, i can't decide what's better; s23 or s22+

s23 does have a smaller battery, but the reviews state that the processor should make the performance better than an exynos chip would (i do not understand these things too much)

but the s22+ has a bigger battery. so

the rest doesn't matter much to me, as both are kinda similar, and good, so. i'd love a smaller phone, but rhe s22+ isn't much different from the base s20, so idk

what do you guys think is the better option?"

"zagg gear4 denali snap case is favorite ""magsafe"" s23 case so far i saw someone post a link to it in a magsafe compiled list but no one had any experience with it, so i ordered it and picked it up from my local verizon store.  they appear to be the only store selling it.

i've tried a few magsafe cases so far including the mous limitless 5.0 and the pitaka, but the zagg gear4 denali snap case feels the best to me.  it has all the qualities of a protective case without the bulk.  

the pitaka case is very thin with almost zero shock absorption and limited protection on the sides and i was actually quite disappointed with the mous case.  a lot of sharp edges and it didn't feel premium to me at all, but the magnet on both the pitaka and mous case are stronger than the zagg.  pitaka's magnet felt the strongest but i wouldn't say the magnet is necessarily weak on the zagg, i would say it's pretty decent!  works just fine on my magsafe car and desk chargers.

just wanted to put this out there in case anyone was curious.  they also sell this in the ultra variant on the verizon store.

"samsung galaxy s23 8/256gb battery life not upto expectations. recently purchased s23, just 4 days back. based on what i see on the internet and this subreddit, battery life has been one of the strong points of this device. but somehow my device seems to be an outlier.  

my usage is pretty normal. mix of wifi and mobile data. some social media/reddit browsing, music listening via bluetooth and watching some youtube  videos. with this usage i got only 4 hr 40 min of sot before the battery hit 10%.  i have setup couple of routine one of which is switching off all connections and putting the phone to power saving mode while i sleep (1am -8am). even with these measures in place, i see battery drain after wake up to be 6%. without this routine setup overnight battery drain was 10%.  in just 40min after disconnecting from the charger and with light usage - mobile data, couple of calls, wallet transactions, couple camera clicks battery discharged from 99% to 90%.

 i do not see my device capable of even 6 hrs sot, pretty far from all the 7-10 sot user claims. wondering if my device is an outlier.

edit: i cleared the cache and was able to squeeze out 7 hrs sot before the battery hit 5%. this is a good improvement. 
still wondering how people are able to get 8 - 9 hrs sot ü§î"
"got my samsung s23 ultra today. what are some of the first things to do on the phone? i upgraded from a google pixel 1 finally and got a s23 ultra today.

like probably everyone, i am excited for the new phone. however, 1 of the things i dislike the most about moving to a new phone is having to learn it... which most often means watching youtube, reading articles, etc.

so i was wondering, what are some of the things someone should do immediately once they first get their s23 ultra?

1 of the thing i just learned is that 1080p is set by default. but with its insanely great battery life, theres no reason to not leave it at 1440p.

2nd thing i learned is that the default settings for camera is set to a pretty high res rate, meaning even small meaningless photos (taking a picture of notes?) will result in a huge file size."
"is it better to charge to 80% or 100%? i've heard a lot of people say that only charging to about 80-85% will make your battery last longer, because the most damage occurs when charging between 80-100%

but if you only charge to 80% every day, you will only have 80% max every day. sure, in 2-3 years your battery health will be better than if you were charging to 100% every day, but in a worst case scenario your battery (when charging to 100% every day) degrades to about 80% in 2-3 years. 

the way i see it, i can have 80% battery everyday or have 100% everyday while it slowly degrades over 2-3 years until it gets to 80% health.  meaning that every time you charge to 100% you will actually be getting only 80% of it's original capacity. which is the same as only charging to 80% when the battery is at 100% health.

so unless you upgrade every 3+ years i don't see a reason to not charge to 100% all the time."

"s23 or s23+, coming from s22 (looking for best battery) hello. so as the title says, i've been suffering with the s22 for a year now, i got it at launch and while i love the size, the last straw was when i took my dad to the hospital and it died on me after barely any use at the end of the day. 

i've used samsung phones for years, and this one is just ridiculously bad. 

anyway. it's probably early but i'm already hearing great feedback about the s23, or rather how it should've been how the s22 is with the battery. that's good. 

i'm also open to considering the plus. the last plus i used was an s20+. i like the s23 size just like i like the s22 size but if the battery difference is quite huge i'm willing to jump. 

also, just wondered, did they finally replace the exynos chips for eu with snapdragon? 

thanks.

"samsungs ""shutter lag"" and blurry photo problem explained and how they could fix it everybody knows about samsungs ""shutter lag"" issue, which to many seems like a complicated issue when imo it really isn't.

first part of the problem is the actual shutter lag, which is the time between pressing the button and the phone taking the picture. samsung included a feature that lets you hold the shutter button to record a video, which means that the phone will only take photos once you release the shutter button. i always believed that not giving an option to turn this off was a stupid idea and thankfully you can already fix this with camera assistant. they should consider disabling this by default or asking users on first startup. 

the second and more interesting part is the actual shutter speed of the photos. it seems that pixel phones automatically adjust the shutter speed based on the amount of motion in the viewfinder, which any pixel owner can test very easily. this is why pixels still do good in camera comparisons where phones are held still, but it handles motion much better than samsung phones because samsung phones will still use a slow shutter speed while pixels speed it up to reduce motion blur.

so that's it. samsung literally built stuff like document scanning and bixby vision, but not just some algorithm to detect motion and correct shutter speeds.

**tl;dr: adjust shutter speed based on viewfinder motion, like on the pixel.**

edit: i've done some more testing and shutter lag is still a bit lower on a pixel while also preserving hdr (samsung sometimes loses hdr), which makes sense given the lengths to which google went to reduce shutter lag. still, the slow shutter speeds causing blurry photos can be fixed with the method i described, which is exactly what google does on pixels as well.

they should be able to fix this if they know what they're doing. i have no idea why they haven't already, maybe the issue is more complicated than what i described but it doesn't seem that way to me."

"note 20 ultra security patches vs s23 current trade-in deals with samsung will get me a regular s23 for 225$ (or s23 ultra for 630$).

debating whether to keep my note 20 ultra or switch to an s23 or s23 ultra?

my main concern is simply security patches and updates. no problems whatsoever with my current device. i've read [here](https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-note-20-last-big-os-upgrade-android-13/) that the n20u might be in its last year for security updates?

what are your thoughts?"

"does google asistant work with ultra 23? this is my first android phone. i've heard the google assistant is better than bixby so i downloaded google assistant. however when i open the app, it says my device doesn't support it which seems odd since it's a brand new phone. is there a workaround for this? is it working on anyone else's phone? 

also another general android question.... i've noticed auto correct had been pretty awful so far with the google messaging. for example, i just typed the word ""correvt"" and it doesn't auto change it to correct. which is kind of shocking. i constantly have to go back and fix typing errors. is there a certain keyboard people use more instead of the default google and samsung messaging?"
"the leap to ios...or nah? (i14 vs s23) i own both apple/android products, legit a half-half split amongst my electronic devices (i know i'm a freak). 


- android: huawei mate 10 // hp pavilion laptop 

- apple: ipad pro 2022 128gb // airpods 3


when i got my ipad last year, i was super keen on switching over to iphone 13/14 this year, but the s23 line dropped and wowwwww - now i kinda down for that.

with both priced around the same, i seek for your opinions on whether should i take the grand leap to apple/remain android.

reasons i'm on the fence:
not wanting to be stuck in the ecosystem and storage 
(similar price for 256gb samsung s23 vs 128gb iphone 14).

some say i should get a 128gb iphone and use my ipad as a second storage (i'm just using ipad to read/study hence the huge remaining storage). but the s23 camera/specs is overall better imo and with the pre-order deals, i can get an free upgrade on the storage as well.

need help this poor girl (i meant it) who wishes to have every penny of her money worth it on the right phone.

(ps: been using airpods 3 with all my android devices, worked perfectly lol now it even auto-detects - just minus the spatial audio and sensors which imo not a huge issue)"

"very concerning backdoor changes to permissions! i have revoked basicly every samsung and google permission and disabled any apps included in that set as i have found my phone runs faster and better afterwards.

since i have seen apk's not install when some of the google api is aloud to run i have disabled them and then found these programs to install without fault.

what concernes me is lately i have noticed mostly google but some samsung apps regranting there own premisons. this has been just plain anoying but whatever, they have there back door what am i to do about it. 

well the other day i went back and saw that google had turned only one premmision on and that was the microphone. this is without my concent and actually specifically against it. 

can i have some phone security please!!!!"
"is the summary of focus modes feature removed? i remember before oneui 5, bedtime mode used to give a graph to show the time the phone was used during sleep time, but now in this new modes and routines sleep mode of oneui 5, it's not giving any summary.

focus modes are also not giving any summary of missed notifications.

am i missing something or did samsung duck it up?"
"i can't be the only one a little upset...s23u 3 years ago, i got an s20u. it was during the time of the original fold. when they came with the plastic screen protector that people ripped off. now samsung decided to go with a crappy recycled cardboard with crappy adhesive that when i opened the box, it was already off the screen, on my s23u. and it's only supposed to be used for protecting the phone inside the box vs actually being used cause it's cardboard.. 

some may think it's a dumb thing to be upset about but when literally no store sells a plastic protector and only the 30$ liquid glass, or tempered glass protectors that i don't want to put on myself or even have... but that plastic film or whatever samsung put on the old phones could be used for years and then your screens protected from the micro scratches."
"upgrade from s20+ broken back germany hi folks,

i've a s20+ which i'm trading in to get s23u in germany. my s20+ back glass is broken but everything else is flawless. 

i've read the terms and conditions for trade-in and only could find about them asking the phone to be in working condition with perfect display. 

however, i've read a lot of negative reviews about teqcycle which manages trade-ins for samsung in germany. so, i'm not sure if i should replace my phone's back before sending it to them (need to figure out the details but should be cheaper than what they are paying for a s20+ with broken display)

does anyone has any similar experience with teqcycle and especially with broken back glass?

thanks!"
"my only pet peeve with the s23 ultra until finding this setting. i completely overlooked this option. i was getting a little annoyed when i swiped up from the bottom that it'd take me multiple times to trigger the gesture. just came across this and some how only saw it for the first time.  so if anyone is as oblivious as me and didn't see this setting was there, hope it helps someone..

"s23 base - battery life after first full charge so to keep long story short, i bought s22 like a month ago and was very dissapointed with the battery life and overheating while doing basic things, after seeing how the new soc performs on s23 i decided to make a jump and it certainly delivered.

so far the only time my phone was hot was during initial setup when all the apps and settings were being transfered, as to battery life its way better than s22.

right now i have 42% left and my sot is **4h45m** and **16h** of standby. with these stats on s22 i would have around 15% left. (and even that had to be a very good day)

i do use 120hz, gps/bluetooth on, lightmode turned off, 99% wifi only today though

apps used: facebook, messenger, instagram, tiktok, camera etc.

i can safely say you can have 6h+ of sot easily with this phone, it may be lower on busy day outside with data though, i will test that in upcoming week."

"my first day of testing my s23 ultra at work (great battery life) so i tend to watch youtube videos with headphones as i work(with work related apps opened in the background), and game/scroll social media when i can or during breaks. i'm pretty much a heavy user all day, even through work. all of this was on a 5g sim card with the screen the entire time.

i started my shift at 98%. i didn't have power saving  mode on during the first two hours of scrolling twitter, reddit and watching youtube. it got down to about 89%. 9% drop in two hours of use isn't bad. i was on pace to be around 56%, give or take at the end of the shift.

once i noticed that power saving mode wasn't on, i turned it on and it greatly improved the performance. by the time i finished my shift, used lyft for a 30 minute ride home(my car is currently in the shop) and continued watching youtube until i was home, my battery was left at 70%. it felt like no matter what i could do this phone wouldn't die. i had so much left after heavy use....i was surprised. if i was even a medium user, this phone would definitely last me more than 1 day. i can't imagine what you'd get as a light user!

my old phone would get very hot under similar circumstances and i'd have to at least charge it twice while working. it was also very uncomfortable within my pocket because of the heat. not only did i not have to charge the s23 ultra once, it never got hot. it was cool as a cucumber in my pocket. the phone is still learning my habits and it's already doing this well. it's very much a 10/10 so far! i don't even have the urge to charge it as we speak lol."

"samsung galaxy book 3 - i3 1315u hi there,

after my old book 10.6 died to a ""broken mainboard"" (i still believe there only was a battery change needed), i got the offer to get a galaxy book 3 with my new broadband contract.
while i was interested at first, i looked the book type up in the internet. the device was neither listed on the official samsung site, nor are benchmarks existing to the new cpu (i3 1315u releases q1 2023)
i can find the device only in 2 electronic shops in my country.
the model number is: np750xfg-ka9de.

is anyone here who can tell me more about that book model? is it made just to be given as an extra?
and more important, how big will the difference be to the weakest official book 3 available on the samsung page? i only intend to use it as a small laptop for my dnd campaign, office, youtube with no intention to play video games on it.

thanks for your answers :)"

"watch 5 pro battery life is pretty good so i recently bought a samsung galaxy watch 5 pro, because i heard a lot of praise for its battery life. from the first charge i got around 2 days of straight use from it, no charging at night, sleep tracking and other functions on auto, no always on display, because i'm not that lazy to turn my wrist or tap the screen. it was good enough for me. on second charge though i'm getting 3 days battery life ez, considering i did an hour workout session and it automatically tracks my walking. i'm impressed, it's a big leap from galaxy watch 4 classic autonomy. wander if anyone can get up to 2 days from previous gen watches."
"i continue to be incredibly happy with the camera! s23u:
photos of stars are my favorite. even in the most optimal conditions, i've never gotten a night mode photo from my old iphone 12 pro max that has been worthy of posting. usually grainy, fuzzy, and didn't pick up much. tonight i was at a friend's house, and noticed the night sky. looked great! i have this neat portable phone stand for photography that fits in my wallet, so i pulled that out and propped the phone in there. went into expert raw, set iso to 100, shutter speed to 30, resolution to 50mp, and pointed the phone at the brightest stars and digitally zoomed in all the way and used the manual focus to focus on stars. took the photo and was pretty dang happy. i don't even think my dslr would have done better in this case. and this was in a light polluted residential area. i can't wait to go camping and see it in action with no light pollution.

losing faith in samsung. this is another let down and even worse that they have not addressed or fixed this yet. 

edit: canada.

edit2: samsung automatically switched users from pay to wallet on feb 1. pay no longer exists. wallet has wiped everyone's payment cards from the app and blocks users from re-adding the cards with an error message that 'the card is already added'. the only user solution mentioned is to delete the app and data and start from scratch. hardly viable when you have 20+ membership cards loaded."

"samsung smartphones with android 10+ and using google assistant to create routines, commands, modes, etc i have a s22+ with android 13 and a pioneer head unit with a wireless aa usb dongle.

i won't even get into the mic issues but how am i supposed to do anything when android auto is now a system app (android 10+ thing apparantly) that doesn't come up in the app list. this all started when got tired of turning both wifi and bt off  anytime i needed to do something aa wouldn't let me do. and not being able to take calls because my head unit doesn't have a mic, aa wont let me use the phone mic, and anytime i'd hit the bt wifi buttons when a call came in they'd turn back on 5 sec into the call. i've messed with all the permissions settings nope no help. so i'd hear them they wouldn't hear me and i couldn't turn it off. i'd literally have to turn off my head unit. anyways as i was getting to how this started... yeah a google search of how to disconnect aa. all results said click the button at the home screen or enable driving mode and then change modes to disconnect. button doesn't exist in any settings and the latter doesn't work. ok so i can create custom actions for the different modes... such as start mode when an app launches or you enter/leave a mode etc. the custom actions you can create are endless. if you need to create an action for an app and android no longer considers android auto an app. same goes with all the google assistant actions commands and routines. i've spent hours on the bs chasing my tail.

my simple question is how do i exit android auto and how do i use any modes, routines, or assistant actions if it doesn't show on the app list."

"samsung india just cancelled my pre-order without properly investigating - worst customer care ever this is a rant, honestly. i am furious right now and feeling horrible. i just had the worst experience shopping from samsung shop app.

&#x200b;

i ordered the s23 on launch day with the free fast brick and wireless charger. it was an exchange for my s22.

the delivery guy arrives and rejects my phone after seeing minor signs of usage. wear and tear on the camera flag. i argue that this is not a scratch, and samsung says this is acceptable. mind you, i have already taken the phone to a samsung smart cafe, and it was clear that the phone was good for a full exchange offer. he argues it is a scratch and he won't take the phone.

over this mark  https://imgur.com/jgk3xbu  

this is what samsung says on their website. but clearly doesn't practice. "" ensure that the mobile phone is in working condition with its display  intact, and that it is not damaged, broken, or otherwise tampered with.  **normal wear and tear is acceptable**. ensure that you share correct  details of the used product, so that the partner‚Äôs associate can  validate the same successfully at the time of pickup. ""

so i raise a ticket with the customer care and some guy who was handling it, without even going through the pictures or reading my email properly. just cancelled the whole order. with all the discounts, and freebies. that idiot even failed to address me by my correct name, just an example of what an ignorant idiot he is.

&#x200b;

now, i am just furious and extremely saddened by this experience. samsung has a horrible customer care service, and i am considering other options now. i definitely don't want to keep this s22 anymore, that's for sure.

i wish there was someway i could get back to these companies for treating the customers like this and getting away with this horrible customer service."

"i have a base s22 and base s23 side by side and sometimes the display looks different adaptive brightness - off
brightness setting - max with extra brightness turned on
white balance - default, neutral
color saturation - vivid

i'm just a n00b, but i know my lg c2 dims on screens with heavy white/blue skies automatically, i think that's what they call auto brightness limiter. well, i loaded up a couple of apps with a white background, like ampere when i was testing the battery (440 vs 630 discharge lmao), and the white looks more like an off-white on the s23 with this suped-up extra brightness setting, and the orange is also less saturated.

usually, i don't notice a difference, but maybe one of the few people out there who have access to a base s22 and s23 can impart some knowledge about what's going on there. i like the look of the s22 more, if you saw it side by side although i'm burning my eyes and i'm sure it comes at a battery cost...but again i don't notice a whiteness/color difference on screens with a dark background

i tried taking a picture and you couldn't really see the whiteness difference in it, other than the orange looking different on ampere"

"brand-new s23+ (at&t) :: the return of dt ignite: hidden ""system"" service just auto-installed a bunch of garbage ""games."" minding my own, saw a notification icon on this s23+, unlocked, and the notification was that setup was complete.

wait, i did all that yesterday. wtf.

tapped the notif, got a window that listed like a dozen shitty games i have less than zero interest in, and the top said ""installed games, installed by mobile services manager."" had to play the ""find and uninstall"" game on the shit it smeared onto my phone.

and of course it's marked as a system app so i had to enable the display of system apps in the app manager to see it. also of course because it's marked as a system file i can only force-stop it, so as soon as i find out what the actual name for the package is i'm gonna be launching ye olde adb and disabling/uninstalling it.

apparently ""mobile services manager"" is a shitware/bloatware autoinstaller (also/formerly known as ""dt ignite"") that comes standard with the android 13 distribution on the s23s, and carriers can use it to push crap onto the phone *without any user interaction or asking for user permission*. it's also a problem child with a several-year history as far as i can tell, and is even listed as a trojan by a few anti-malware apps.

gotta love it when thousand-dollar phones come with a built-in ad dropper/pup installer...

&nbsp;

update: mobile services manager *reinstalled the same shitware that it did previously and i took off*! had to go back through and re-remove the garbage games it dropped a second time. this time i was pissed off and grabbed an apk list app and found its two com files: com.dti.att (since i'm on at&t) and com.dti.folderlauncher. fired up adb for some debugging, and uninstalled both. if they come back i'm nuking the files outright.

while i was at it i also ripped out bixby, the ar stuff i don't use, the gaming stuff i also don't use as i don't play games on this phone, and a couple other odds and ends i don't or won't use that i find annoying (like samsung pass - if i want to put a password manager on there it'll be keepass). restarted the phone and oh, hey, it reboots slightly faster. imagine that."

"s23 ultra - first full charge. should i be worried? here is my initial battery stats after installing all apps and transferring all my photos from my s22u.

i used smart switch but only to transfer all my file and photos. the apps were installed manually. 

should i let the battery settle in first?

i was kind of surprised not to get the battery stats the people posted here on reddit.

"s23 ultra slow fingerprint scanner? i just picked up the s23 ultra today. i upgraded from the s21 fe and expected the fingerprint scanner to be at least a tiny bit faster, but honestly it's not any faster than the s21 fe and if anything is slightly slower. has this been the case for any of you?"
the s23 ultra is amazing but... how could they remove the screen led color notification function??? how can i know if i have a notification when screen is off without using the shitty always-on-display?
charging s23 ultra till 85 % just to save battery and slow charging is pretty stupid that phone costs 1200 dollars.feels terrible after spending that much amount and not using the device to its fullest potential given that s23 ultra is giving phenomenal battery life and restricting yourselves just to save some percentage of battery tear. and battery replacement costs are like 30 dollars or less(apple charges 100 dollars fyi)..free with  samsung care

"thinking about getting the s23 (base) after 9 years of using only sony xperia and google pixel. hello,

since i had my first smartphone back in aug 2013, i have only had two brands: sony xperia and google pixel. 

i tried to stay faithful to sony, but the price of their phones is too high for what they are offering (only two major updates and ironically the camera isn't the best).

i switched to pixel back in feb 2021. my experience has been positive. the pixel 4a is a very good device for its price (i paid us$390 because i exported it to my country). however, the battery is horrible. i am about to go to my first international trip since the pandemic and i am worried the phone won't let me take pictures. i bought a fast powerbank for now.

i have never had a samsung phone. however, i've been using samsung tablets for about 7 years. it's important to mention the way i use my tablet is different. i use it mostly to watch my weekly tv shows, reading and for youtube and some music sometimes. that's it. that's why i was never bothered by the bloatware even if my a7 lite only came with 32gb.

i could make a sacrifice and get the s23 base, but these are my worries.

**bloatware**: my tablet is insanely bloated by a lot of apps you can disable, but not uninstall.

**camera**: the pixel 4a takes amazing pictures 95% of the time. the reviews of the s23 are good, but are the pictures as good as the pixel's?

**battery life**: i don't expect 10hr, but can i expect 8hr of sot on wi-fi?

**support**: how many major updates is samsung offering? 

the experience of those who have had pixels is welcome.

thanks"

"lifelong iphone user here: i want off the (dynamic) island! s23 ultra just arrived! this is a combination of a rant/question.

i want off dynamic island. i'm downright sick of the iphone. sick of ios. so plain, so boring. zero innovation for the last 5+ years from apple. all we got is a boring, lame, lifeless dynamic island.

u23 ultra just arrived yesterday. will this be my ticket off the island? pretty sick upon first impressions -- love the innovation, s-pen cool, works great. display is second to none.. also plays nice with my windows based pc. 

not saying i'm going to keep it, as i've been here before... i may return it, who knows. but i am enjoying my time off the island. 

biggest pet peeve seems to be the lack of the lock screen turning on when new alerts come in, as they do on the iphone. i tend to miss alerts when my screen doesn't light up. i know there is ""glimpse notifications"" 3rd party app that i can download to utilize, but i really don't want to use a third party app to simply get notifications. has samsung created a solution for this apparent massive oversight yet? 

ive also fired up my old watch3, which seems to be working great in lieu of my apple watch ultra. trying to work out the kinks with samsung health and get used to how its interface works, as well. working on transporting apps over, too (mynetdiary, pacer, etc).

battery life is insane too!

thanks samsung for keeping the heat on apple!"

120hz, auto brightness, wqhd+ 

first night in 3 years that i didn't have to worry about charging my phone overnight, i just fast charge when i wake up now

timeline: took the s23u off the charger at 7 am. i work a 8-5pm job, i used roughly 2.5 hours sot here. once home, i was on my phone till about 7pm. hit the road to see the in-laws, wife drove so i was on my phone testing youtube and instagram videos with about 1 hrs sot. at the in-laws around 9pm and was sitting at 55%. spent the rest of the night on fb, chrome and youtube with some os system changes since the phone is still new. was in bed by 12pm and 30-35%. woke up around 9am and spent my morning on the phone till around 11:30 am at 12% and posted this battery usage here. plugged it in for about 30 minutes and it got me to 65% at noon. currently at 57% at 3pm. this phone is a beast!"
has anyone else noticed an increase in typing accuracy? i used to type wrong things all the time on my s21. that almost never happens on the s23u. i don't know if it's because the screen is bigger or what. has anyone else noticed this?

"s23 ultra not charging over night i got the new s23 ultra and like it so far. the issue i am having is that it won't charge over night.

i bought a onn wireless charger which i used to set the phone on at night to charge. when i put the phone on it the first night it was at 70%, when i got up the next morning it was at 63%. i chalked it up to me not having the charger in the right place on the phone or i had bumped it at night moving it to a spot where it didn't charge. same thing happened the next night. at this point i'm starting to think it's just a cheap shitty charger. last night i plugged in the phone instead of using wireless charging, when i got up the phone still wasn't fully charged and was at a lower % then when i plugged it in. every time i set it on the charger or plug it in before bed the phone does indicate that it is charging. 

this is only happening overnight. i have the phone sitting next to me right now on the same charger and it is charging just fine. i can sit here and watch the battery % go up as i am typing this.

is anyone else having this problem? any settings that i can check? i love galaxy and have had them for many years. this is the first real problem i have had."

"s23 ultra case reccomendations? got the s23 ultra today. so far i am digging it! my first purchase from the ultra lineup after having just the regular galaxy for years. 

any reccomendations for a case that has a bit more rounded corners? a lot of the cases conform to the sharp corners of the phone itself and whew, it starts to hurt the hand after a bit if i am holding it in one hand, haha. 

i know it's obviously very early in the production of cases considering the phone was just mass released on the 17th, so i'll keep an eye out! but if you find any that you like, let me know!"

i've looked a bit into this subreddit and haven't managed to find an exact answer to what i'm looking for, so i decided i'd make a post. 

i have had the galaxy note 8 since release, and the battery has always been subpar. a few weeks ago i decided to run a diagnostic only to find out that a battery replacement is recommended. 

as i've never really encountered any other issues with this phone, be it mild or serious, i was wondering if a battery replacement would be cheaper down the line, or perhaps it may be time for divorce. 

any feedback is welcome! thank you all in advance!"

"s23+ and its missing qhd+ resolution this really drives me crazy. even my 8 year old s6 with its 5.1"" screen has qhd. oc it's not all about the resolution and qhd is op for such a small device but i really don't get why samsung degraded the resolution with the s21. 
is it just because they want to upsell the ultra?
however coming from a one plus 7t pro a switch to the samsung flagships would feel like a downgrade in terms of the display.
are you just as mad as me or are you happy enough with fhd?"
"disappointing battery life of s21 ultra hello everyone, i just wanted to share some frustration with the battery life of my s21 ultra.

in march it's going to be two years since i bought the phone and i can't be more happy with it except one thing - battery life. it's horrible. 

i'm the kind of a person who really takes care of their phone because i plan to use it for at least 3 or 4 years. because of that, i never charged my phone to 100%, only to 85%, made sure i don't discharge it too much (never below 30% really), never charged it overnight, you get the point. i'd say i'm a moderate user, where i'll use it for general texting and sometimes watching twitch or youtube for hour or two. 

all that gives me a battery life that's less than a day.  i previously owned note 10 and the battery life there was way better than on the s21 ultra. because of that i decided to download battery app from store, charged my phone from 1% to 100% and got the great news ... out of advertised 5000 mah battery, i have left around 4200 mah. 

4200 mah is around 85% of the original capacity after two years of very careful use. to be fair i am really disappointed in the battery life of the phone, i expected it to easily last me a day but that's just not been possible for around a year now. 

i understand that the battery will obviously degrade over the years, but 15% degrade in two years with very careful handling of the phone just seems way to off for me. for comparison, my even older phone s7 still has battery life of 90%, after it's been used for 2 years by me and 1 year by my mom. same goes for the note 10 i gave her she's still using right, that phone is at 88% after being used 2 years by me and 2 years by her already. 

does anyone else have similar experience with their phones? this is really frustrating me, and given how insane battery life iphones have  at the moment it's really making me think about everything as someone who owned samsung phones their whole life."

"worth it to upgrade from s22+ vs s23+ hey there! i own a snapdragon s22+ for about 11 months now, thinking if i should upgrade to the s23+. my main focus would be on the battery, because i'm getting about 6 hours sot on my s22+ only. anyone has done the upgrade and would recommend me to update? thanks!"
"s23+ battery life and other comments coming from an exynos s10+, i am quite happy with the battery life and performance on the s23+ after about a week of using it. i started my day yesterday morning (8 am) with 100% and got about 8 hrs 45 mins of active screen on time (sot) till today noon (15%) with heavy-ish usage. screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/kwnh8yz). i shuffle through, spotify, boost, youtube, whatsapp and news websites on chrome mainly. i switch between wifi and 5g but i think it's safe to say that it's about 70% wifi. the display was set to 120 hz and adaptive brightness was turned on. i also use my galaxy buds plus to listen to music sparsely throughout the day. 

i am writing this post for people who are on the fence about upgrading from an exynos s9/s10 to the s23+/s23u. i had a tough time deciding between the s23u and the s23+ as i really like the 10x optical zoom on the s23u but strongly dislike its shape and size. also, i don't see myself using the s-pen a lot. on the other hand, i really like the shape and design of the s23+ but was skeptical about the screen. i then realized that i had my s10+ on fhd+ and not wqhd+ throughout the last 3¬Ω years. so, i finally went with the s23+ 512 gb and i must say, i am very happy with my decision. the switch from exynos to snapdragon is noticeable in terms of performance, battery and heat management as well. i don't have any problems with the screen at all (i did configure the screen zoom and font size to make it look the best) and i am very happy with the camera as well. 


hope this post helps at least one person to make an informed decision. feel free to let me know if you have any questions about the phone, will try my best to answer!"
"charging ever other day, healthy for battery ? for the first time, with 23+ i don't have to charge every day. my last few day, after the phone had optimized for me, i had to charge every other day at most. can kt be considered ""healtier"" for the battery longevity ?"
"i can't believe the color transition ( banding ) is still so bad on top of line s23 ultra so samsung has the known best oled panel on the market for its s23u. i don't doubt. but whats wrong with google and samsung's own firmware and software support that makes the color banding still so bad on year 2023, not even good enough for a true 8 bit system, and so far benind any 8bit+frc or even 10 bit system.

dont lie to yourself it's unnoticeable. look at the samsung default green-brown wallpapaer , upper left half,. see how tbr shades break with many boudaries going from dark to bright? there are a lot more scenes and gui interfaces affected too.

and i am gonna prove it's even slightly worse than the samsung model 3 years ago. a random old iphone will beat the sxxx out of s23u. everything shown here is less obvious than how it really looks i swear.

this one appears to be smooth on both s23u and iphone 12. but look at the incorrect transitions at arrows
. the 2 stripes are obviously darker than surroundings. it should become brighter all the way.  the iphone has it done properly without any visual weiredness.

and then the famous rtings gradient image. this is a 16 bit tiff. on iphone if opened in photos, it would be shown in 10 bit. and if opened in safari it's 8 bit. yes, iphone supports 10 bit with ios 16. dont be fooled. and i dont think any app supports 10 bit on s23u. 
https://i.imgur.com/xogz1g4.jpeg

look at the arrows where note20u and s23 u show large jump in red and green. interestingly it seems they appeared exactly at the same levels! so samsung uses the identical lut and color transform matrix between native and a standard color space for the panels 3 generations apart??

again the contrast and artifacts are much more noticeable in reality. steps in iphone at all and the transition is uniform and consistent. ( the weired pattern is from reflection) the samsung models, due to only 8 bit depth, show edges wheenever a level changes , which is totally ok. what's bad is the sudden jumps in shades here and there. 

and s23u is even worse than note20 in some scenes because of the poorly calibrated gamma/lut. 

this is the login screen of southwest app. look at the bigger jump of shade at the arrow for s23u.
https://imgur.com/a/gfrb71h
 the  number of levels is the same for 2 models that i can confirm so there is no additional bit depth loss in s23. its just that it's calibrated poorly.

so this is disappointing. i am not nitpicking such trivials and ruining people's good feelings about their adorable phone.  its just sometimes these are so annoying to see and they ruin the scene by cutting an otherwise enjoyable screen with these ugly banding edges. samsung and google, you goota do something about it."

"best < 15/20 $ screen protector for impact protection and working fingerprint reader on a galaxy s22 ? hi !

i'm currently looking for a screen protector for my brand new s22, but it seems like most screen protectors have issues with the fingerprint reader, or are hit-or-miss.

i already have a folio case (to protect the screen when it is closed), but as i tend to have clumsy hands (at least in the past), i would like one that has a rather good impact protection and a good value for money. 

my brother is quite happy with his jetech screen protector, but reviews for the s22 shows it doesn't work most of the time with the screen protector. around 25 $ there also is the rhinoshield impact protection, which is very tough, but reviews are pretty bad, so it doesn't seems like it is as good as it used to be for that price.

there also is amfilms screen protectors (hybrid or onetouch, not the +30 $ one), but i would like more reciews on the impact protection side aswell as on potential issues with the fp reader.

i also saw the milomdoi screen protector, and also the supershieldz tempered glass which seems good, i guess ? what do you think ?

i read a lot of posts on various subreddits, but people are basically looking for a scratch-resistant protector. most people seems to buy expensive wsd and amfilms tempered glass or samsung's official screen protector, while a majority of them agrees that expensive screen protectors are in practice almost the same as cheaper ones.

thank you a lot for your precious help."

"i think i know where ‚Äúbixby‚Äù got its name from. üññüèº as far as i know, there‚Äôs no official explanation given nor sufficient information found online, as to where samsung‚Äôs voice assistant bixby gets its name from. there are some suggestions that it‚Äôs chosen because it‚Äôs a unique name and does not bring any trademark issues, so it was safe to be named as bixby. so, according to my research, it was almost fully unknown. well, until now‚Ä¶ it might not be the actual case, but i‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs the closest guess to the origin of the name bixby. 

in star trek the original series, there‚Äôs an episode named ‚Äúmirror, mirror‚Äù which is the fourth episode from the second season. the episode was first broadcast on october 6, 1967 and it was ranked as one of top ten ""must see"" episodes of the original series, and one of the most celebrated ones. 

in the episode, we see the crew communicating with the ship‚Äôs computer and the computer answering questions and computing the commands given by the crew like a modern day voice assistant, like bixby, siri, alexa. 
it wasn‚Äôt of course the first time computer appearing in the series so far, but i believe it was indeed the first episode in which the communication between the voice assistant and the crew was this much advanced. 

‚Äúmirror, mirror‚Äù episode was written by jerome bixby, a writer highly acclaimed by the critics, and this was the first of the four episodes he wrote for the series. 

and, as a matter of fact, the developers or the company was inspired by this computers advancement which was created by jerome bixby, and samsung is paying tribute to him and his legacy. 

i‚Äôm ready to be proven wrong! go ahead. üññüèº"
"do s22 screen protectors fit the s23? i have an extra s22 (not ultra) screen protector lying around and wanted to know if i can use it with the s23 i have coming in the mail, thanks!"
"thank you, samsung for not making the s23 a curved screen device perfect sized phone with a good battery and a flat screen. love it 10/10"
unlocked s23 ultra works with esim on tmobile tried activating it on at&t with esim and the rep couldn't do it because it wouldn't let him. i even tried calling customer service and they couldn't either. wouldn't work with a physical sim either on at&t which was really weird. i then went to t-mobile was able to port my phone over and they were able to activate this unlocked s23 ultra on their network with an esim easily. i saw a previous post here saying that it couldn't be activated on verizon either via esim. just wanted to let people know that it will work via esim on t-mobile.

"s23 external storage has a problem i need to discuss about the s23 and external storage. if anyone else is planning on using external storage on this device please look elsewhere or hopefully wait for a update. 

i got my s23 on the 15th and everything is great aside from the finicky fingerprint scanner and the recognition of usb external devices. its so inconsistent with external usb that it‚Äôs ridiculous. i have a nvme ssd in a usb 3.2 gen 2 10gbps enclosure and i formatted it in fat32/exfat/ntfs and it still randomly works on the s23. (the next day it doesn‚Äôt show up at all anymore). initially it will work and i can transfer 10+ large video files then the next time i plug in it it doesn‚Äôt see it. it will then randomly work and not work. i read it was a power issue with nvme so i grab a low power sata ssd and a usb 3.1 gen 1 5gbps enclosure and it works and i can transfer files fine at first. i then try another file (100mb) and then it freezes and disconnects and now won‚Äôt show up on the phone anymore. is anyone else having this issue with their s23? is this being addressed at all? the drives work flawlessly on my old oneplus 8t and ipad pro but on the s23 it‚Äôs like a lottery if it will work at all."
"uag vs mous cases? what's your opinion on uag vs mous cases in terms of quality and protection?

"is it worth upgrading from s22u (exynos version) to s23u just for the new snapdragon chip? so i upgraded from the s20 5g to the s22 ultra when it came out last year.
i like the phone, i think it's a great phone (though i still struggle to use the camera - i find the camera interface not very intuitive at all, and think the iphone cameras are better in that regard. i was a bit disappointed by the s22u and even the s20 cameras, only becuase i find them non intuitive. if i sat down and properly looked into it, i'm sure i'd find them much better).

but i'm in the uk, and i know my phone has an exynos chip and i think that may be the source of my problems. 

- not being able to use the camera after viewing an image taken, unless i close (quit) and reopen the camera app, which is very annoying for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it type scenario 
- phone keyboard sometimes freezing and playing catch up (sometimes if i try delete a few characters it'll glitch then catch up and delete whole words amd sentences) 
- phone being frozen on (only a handful of times, and somehow i've been able to resolve it each time) and having a notification pop up saying ui is not responding. 

it doesn't happen all the time, and it's not a low storage issue as its a 512gb with 318gb used.

i'm debating whether to trade in my s22u and upgrade to the s23u but i'm not sure if it's too much just for the new chip? 
the new camera is a bonus, but again i've said i struggle a bit with them and find i can't use them to their full potential.

if i trade in online, and apply the code s23boost i can get up to ¬£750 off (anyone who doesn't have a smartphone to trade in/doesn't want to,  the code s23save gives ¬£100 off instantly) and get it for i think ¬£629, though it won't ship til the 3rd march. 

i've also not done an online trade in, and would worry royal mail strikes would mean my phone gets lost and i don't get the upgrade discount; i'd rather do it in store. 
anyone know if samsung stores honour online voucher codes? 

anyway, what are your thoughts on this?"

"s23u first 100% to 5% discharge and recharge to 50% ok, so i did my first discharge from 100% to 5% and got over 8 hours sot the last hour and change was watching a movie though.. and not sure why one ui takes up a lot of battery (maybe cause i read the news in the google discovery side page). 

[battery usage](https://imgur.com/a/0x16983) 

as for recharge wow with my koval 120w charger (i know the s23u only does up to 45w) , up to 50% in like 17 minutes! that's nutz,  as i type this 24 minutes at 62% already! impressive.

"s23 ultra - how to change widget colors? upgraded from the note9 to the s23u, it just came in the mail today! slowly moving my accounts and things over, and noticed that my google calendar widgets are now messed up - they say they're displaying in dark mode, but instead of actually being black text on a black bg like it was on my note9, they display dark blue bgs with very bright white text. is there a way for me to change the font color of google calendar's widget? there's no widget specific setting i can seem to find, unfortunately. 

also, my spotify widget displays as blue instead of black - would really love to just set it to a stark black as well. any suggestions will be appreciated!!"
problem sending messages? my s22 ultra is the biggest pos ever. it hardly ever sends messages. i was just in town had 5 bars at&t and my buddy sent me a message saying happy birthday i tried to respond it popped up an hour later saying message not sent. does anyone else have this issue? i'm really thinking about switching to an iphone i'm tired or this mediocre ass phone.
"s23 ultra screen protector choices what screen protectors are people using on this? i tried the official samsung one but not happy with it, looks like there's lines where the middle piece of the back layer was.

ordered a spigen neoflex which i hope will be better since i can't see a spigen tempered glass for this phone.

anyone got other suggestions?"
"screen protectors, whitestone dome a little too short? just got my s23u and applied the whitestone dome protector, def was a bit of a challenge as i had to push and slide the thing around as the glue refused to spread out to all of the edges and it appears to be a little too short and doesn't cover the whole screen? am i better off going with a spigen neoflex film? also i had to wipe the screen alot to get the smudges off. the cloth wasn't super clean as it's been sitting around for a bit, is it possible i messed upt he screen by scratching it with the cloth? or am i fine.

"s23 ultra camera bump no case i don't typically use cases.


my previous phone was a note 20 u and when flat on a tablet, it doesn't tilt unless you touch the top left corner area.


now i have a s23u now and by default it's already tilting so everytime i touch the device it moves which is annoying.... so i'm kinda forced to buy a case aka bad design.

"samsung galaxy book3 pro 360 two weeks later after using the samsung galaxy book3 pro 360 for two weeks, i'd like to share my thoughts on this laptop. the aluminum chassis is attractive, and its compact size makes it easy to carry around. i had to adjust to the larger touchpad as my previous laptop had a smaller one, but it didn't take long to get used to it. although i wish the keyboard had more depth, it's still comfortable to type on. ~~the laptop lacks a fingerprint reader~~ and only has one usb type-a port, but it compensates for that with two usb-c thunderbolt 4 ports and an hdmi port. the battery life is great, and i was able to use it all day without needing to charge it.

&#x200b;

the laptop's performance is impressive, and i was able to run multiple tabs, documents, and presentations without any issues. although i haven't tried gaming on it, it runs lightweight games smoothly. the webcam quality is disappointing, and i hope that laptop manufacturers will start including better cameras as video calls are becoming increasingly common. the laptop has not overheated, except for one instance when i accidentally left it running in my laptop bag. the screen quality is fantastic, with accurate colors and the 3:2 aspect ratio makes it immersive for work or entertainment. the dolby atmos sound also enhances the streaming and movie-watching experience. overall, i think this laptop is a great choice for students, teachers, or anyone looking for a reliable, lightweight, and premium-quality laptop for a good price.

&#x200b;

other notes:

&#x200b;

\* battery life: 10-12 hours casual use, medium brightness

\* charge time: little over an hour depending if i am using it or not

\* touchscreen: responsive and accurate

\* pen: inconvenient as there is no place to dock it, you have to stick it to the back of the screen.

\* gaming: not a gaming laptop, emulators run smooth, sims 4 is smooth as well

\* not a dust magnet

\* easy to pair with the phone but i have not found a real reason to control my phone with the laptop (just seems like a gimmick) other than to send over photos"
i was (kinda) right throughout the pre order i've been telling people that they should wait to trade in their s22 ultra because of the absurdly low trade in (only $500). now that pre order is over the trade in magically went to $600. same thing happened last year. last year the s21u at pre order was like 700 and a few months later it was 1000. i bet in another 3 months the s22u trade in will see atleast $800

i'm not able to get the referral codes working. i'm trying to get a base s23 ultra and trade in my s22, and pay in full one time payment. no financing or trading in through t-mobile

real world s-pen use greetings all...just another iphone user lurking on the sidelines. i am really curious to know how many of you note/s22 & s23 ultra users actually use the s-pen on a regular basis for note taking. i am debating selling my iphone 13 pro and grabbing an s23 ultra (or waiting to see if the fold 5 has a built in pen) for traveling light but being ready to jot notes in a meeting without lugging a laptop or ipad. its been a hot minute since i had samsung device (damn bixby button on the s9+ was the bane of my existence) and now i am tempted again. thanks!

i leave my screenshot because i'm pretty noob to say if its a improve from the 7h sot or not.

hope software iu improves a little more."
"45w charger is actually worth it this year for s23 ultra 1->73% in 30min while the phone is ""on"" previous years the 45w was kinda not worth it , i even checked the benchmarks online, the difference was literally 1% more charge in the first 30min (lol)  and 4% faster overall to 100% charge (s22 ultra)

my s23u results (i'm using official samsung 65w charger although samsung s23u is limited to 45w)

1% to 73% 30min 45w charge (it says supercharge 2.0 when plugged) (phone is turned on+wifi)

1% to 57% 30min 25w charge (it says super charge only when plugged) (phone is on+wifi)

sure its only 16% difference (beats the 1% with s22u) but mentally leaving the house with 70%+ battery is different than 50%+ :p when you are in a rush

samsung is cheap though for not including it for free.

edit : the full time to charge using 45w is 58min to me (from 1% to 100% while phone is on)

so yeah the last 27% charge takes as much as the first 73% kinda

"please help me decide on a color! hi, all. i got both a red s23 ultra and a graphite s23 ultra. i ordered both because stores in my area don't have any demos, and i couldn't get the right feel for what they looked like irl without having them in my hand.

anyway, they both finally arrived yesterday, but i am so torn. i love both colors so much. the matte black everything on the sides, around the cameras, the bottom, etc. looks so good with both the graphite and red color. i usually always have black or gray phones, so i was actually leaning towards going for something crazy different for me (the red), but the graphite looks really good... i can't decide!

please help! which one do you like better? maybe you can help me make up my mind...

i usually end up with a dbrand skin and a clear case eventually, so i don't typically worry much about getting anything but black... but i'm excited by a new color!

edit: i know graphite won by a landslide, but as i was packaging up the red to return it, i felt really disappointed. thus, i kept the red! the heart knows what it wants. *shrug*

"i went s10 > iphone 13 pro > s23+ had always been an android user since the galaxy s2. then had the s4, note 4, moto xt1575, og pixel, s10.

i really went to an iphone 13 pro as i wanted a normal sized phone (around 6"") with 512gb storage. in the us you're basically limited to apple, samsung and google. i had first tried the pixel 7 pro and s22 ultra.

the pixel 7 pro had a few odd scrolling related bugs that really annoyed me. i would have otherwise maybe kept it even if it was a bit too big for my liking. the s22u was really too big and the sharp corners were very uncomfortable to hold.

so i got an iphone and used it for 3 months. there is honestly a lot to like about it. the phone is generally smooth and most of the apps are well designed. but then slowly the annoyances started to build:

* no universal back gesture. most of the time the back gesture worked, but sometimes it didn't and that was annoying
* animations are great on iphone but you also always need to wait for them to finish before you can interact with the screen
* managing photos and files is impossible if you want to do it any other way than apple intended
* keyboards all suck. my text input was generally a lot slower
* notifications are messy overall, though i do like the badges on the app icons (on android when you dismiss a notification the badge also disappears which is dumb)
* my biggest annoyance was needing to use itunes to put anything on the phone, like music and old photos. such an antiquated way of doing things. you first need to create a whole playlist library to mimic your folder structure and then import it all to your phone and then each time you want to add anything you need to sync the library instead of just copying the file like on android. and then for some reason each time it would resync 3500 songs! pissed me off to no end.
* the apple app store is a capitalist hellscape. almost everything wants to nickel and dime you, charge a subscription here, charge a subscription there. i don't mind supporting the developer of a good app, but a lot of apps you only need to use every now and again so no, i'm not paying you $5 a month for your shitty app. 

so now i got the s23+. there was a lot to like about the iphone, don't get me wrong. but it's good to be back to a device that just gives me more freedom to do what i want. android you can use out of the box and be perfectly content, or you can tweak it. and that's just why i prefer android. it's better for me.

and the s23+ is a great device. right on the edge of what i can handle size wise (any bigger is a no go). though i would've preferred the regular s23 still, but no 512 gb storage on that in the us."

"my new s22 ultra was already on android 13 when i got it. should i worry? i got my phone 3 days ago, from a big trusted store in my city, samsung package was complete and perfect and it even had the ""dont accept the phone if this seal is open"" sticker closed on it i opened it there. everything was inside and perfect, i took the screen and back stickers off from the phone and turned the phone on, it showed me welcome screen and the first time setup, after i set it up and the phone started to run, i checked the android version and it was already 13 one ui 5.0
it was the vietnam pack and the sm-s908e/ds version with 12gb or ram and 256gb of memory (snapdragon processor)

however, the order still hasnt been shipped, so i contacted them, and it seems my order will be sent next week so i hopefully get the phone next week, simply because the $10 screen protector for their brand new phone isnt in their inventory, so i wont get my phone in time.. excellent job samsung."
"gnss positioning comparison between s23u snapdragon and s22u exynos welcome. have any of you compared the positioning accuracy of the galaxy s23 ultra yet? since i live in europe, my earlier s22 ultra has an exynos processor and i can relate to it. before the release of the s23u, i read that qualcomm had already introduced gnss rtx trimble in the snapdragon 8 gen1, which they boasted would offer meter-level accuracy. as soon as i set up my new phone i started testing and comparing everything one by one. unfortunately, it turned out that the s23u has worse accuracy than the s22u. looking at the estimated horizontal and vertical accuracy, the s23u achieves 3.8/2.5 meters, while the s22u on exynos achieves 1.5/2.0 meters at the same time holding the phones side by side. i'm using the gsptest app [gpstest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.gpstest) those are screenshoots from my tests:

edit: i somehow manage to have a live chat with samsung's customer service and they suggest to clear cache and data which i couldn't find in the beginning. settings > apps > filter button > show system apps > samsung keyboard > storage > clear cache and data. then restart phone. it lessen the battery drain. though i have to do the setup again for the keyboard, like languages, symbols layout, etc.

just putting it here, in case some others experience the same. thank you."
s23 plus type c to 3.5 mm replacement the type c to 3.5 mm headphone adapter is always out of stock on the official website(i have been tracking it for 3+ months now). is there any other good quality product which can act as a replacement and would work with the s23 plus without compromising on either input (media) or output (calls/mix) sound quality? i have heard about dac's but i'm not fully aware of them and which ones to consider and if they would work with this phone (please feel free to educate me on this if you can)

"registering the same finger multiple times really helps the fingerprint scanner on s23. i had a lot of problems with fingerprints on the s9 and eventually gave up. the s23 ultra was a bit finicky at first, but i found that registering the same finger multiple times (as separate finger entries), scanning it at a different angle on each registration, really helps. if it doesn't recognize you based on the original scan, it will recognize it as one of the others, and you won't need to reposition your finger and retry five times, hoping for it to work.

i don't know if there's something weird about my fingerprints or the scanning software, but if anyone else is having this problem, give this a shot. it seems to make a big difference."
is there a way to change hdmi aspect ratio when connected to monitor/projector using an s series phone without dex? could be a bit of a niche use case here.. but i currently use my s7+ tab and spen to take classes while hooked up to a projector on a whiteboard. would love to use my s21 ultra on some occasions but the aspect ratio makes the screen too small and with black bars up and down ie mimicking the phone. is there any way to improve the aspect ratio? works perfectly with dex but i can't use dex since i need to draw/write on my phone during class. is there any free or paid app or any setting to increase the aspect ratio(i remember a few lg phones could do this). does a z fold 3/4 have this issue too or do their aspect ratios work properly for this use case? cheers.

"i have had every samsung flagship for the last 10+ years. s23 ultra stands with the goats note 4 and note 9. this phone is perfect. i have had the note 3, note 4, note 5, note 8, note 9, note 10+, note 20 ultra, z flip 3, s22 ultra and now the s23 ultra.

the note 3 was a great phone. note 4 was a perfect beast. note 5 was great. note 8 was nice but not as good as the 4. note 9 was perfect. from here things started to go downhill and what they improves in one area they downgraded in another, eg speakers, battery life, processor etc.

now i have the s23 ultra and i can't fault it. amazing cameras, amazing battery life, great speakers, my phone performance is amazing. samsung have perfected and improved the s22 ultra. what more could anyone want. i am super happy with this phone - it stands out with the goats note 4 and note 9"

"1st day with s23+ truly a beast! so i was able to test my s23+ for a full long day outside for the first time.

i started at 100% at 8am and came back home at 11pm only on 5g.

although i did only use screen for 1h37min i was still at 68% when i arrived home.

truly impressive knowing that i was 3h in an area without good network coverage which probably was heavy on the battery.

in perspective, the similar day with my 4 years old s9+ i would come home with 15/20% battery if i'm optimistic.

with this in mind i know i can safely use the 85% charging limit option that samsung offer to avoid reducing lifespan of the battery by remaining too much in the 85/100 range.

i feel that this phone could last easily 3 days if used in economic mode with network partially activated for a long weekend in the wild for example.

anyway looking forward to test it more!"

"samsung qn700b 8k seems seriously flawed and even rtings is vastly downplaying the issue. **a while ago i started heavily looking into 8k tv for pc productivity powerhouse setup.**

i currently use a 40"" 4k monitor, and saw 55"" 8k as a huge upgrade. but first my task was to go to local currys to see the display in person, and my first impression was rather poor. 8k screen looked significantly worse than nearby 4k screen of same 55"" size. **this also applies to 65"" qn800b**


i noticed that the mild dithering in shadows mentioned by rtings is actually significantly worse, and even over 2ft away this was very visible in form of jagged high contrast edges, which appeared sharp and straight on a 4k tv next to it.

i also had a chat with the rep, who quickly admitted that 8k tvs are a serious gimmick and even the rep recommended staying away.

unfortunately they didn't allow me to test a laptop input into the tv to see if that changes anything about the pixel dithering issue. 

i played with the remote and tried switching the picture modes (game mode or pc mode was absent), and the dithering only became worse when i took off the 'in the shop' mode.

so i started investigating and learned about the contrast modulation, and how it affects picture quality. samsung's 8k tvs have very low contrast modulation compared to many 4k tvs they also make. it is related to how samsung uses neighboring pixels to improve contrast in sharp edges, thus creating the dithering effect.

the next thing i realized, that all of this issue is heavily downplayed, not really mentioned or discussed at all.

people buy 8k tvs fairly blindly due to absence of serious warnings even from rtings. one fellow /r/monitors user has been very frustrated with his qn700b and it's dithering issue. as i see no solution, i've recommended him to try refunding it, or replacing for different (4k) model.

------
**tldr:**

so the real reason why i posted this is... i want 8k tv owners to come out and discuss their issues and possible solutions. 

let me know if plugging hdmi 2.1 pc into this tv actually affects dithering or is it really a no go, as i still wish to have a 8k 55"" screen for graphical work.

and spread the word so people don't end up with an expensive unwanted tv.

"the effort samsung is putting into marketing the s23 us unreal - lets take a moment to appreciate it's marketing genius really. they've launched the device globally, and most would agree that it's gone without any major hitches. they've integrated real-time countdowns of promotions throughout the web's ecosystem, as well as on tv and tv-based streaming services, social media platforms and radio.

the penetration of marketing achieved here is perhaps one of the greatest launches of our generation, reaching all corners of the globes across all platforms.

"s23 ultra weird behaviour **eye comfort shield messes with black levels.**

once enhanced comfort is turned on, any pixel that should be entirely black doesn't turn off but rather dims down to a level that's decided by the current brightness setting.

so at high brightness, what should be black is actually very prominently grey.

""adjust colour tones and contrast.."" yeah, contrast. just why?

&#x200b;

**the refresh-rate doesn't  doesn't appear to go below 24hz.**

this ltpo tech is really poorly understood in general. some reports  indicate that the s22 can drop down to 24hz, while samsung themselves  state that it can't go below 48hz.

additionally, there's a theory that  the gpu only renders at 1fps on the ultra models, but the screen is  actually refreshing at 24hz.

however, some have reported it showing as  low as 10hz, so nobody really knows for sure."

"s23 ultra + whitestone dome tempered glass review so i have heard the grumblings about whitestone and such on here, and i know that there's case compatibility issues.  just going to share my experience so far.

i got my s23 ultra yesterday and pretty much the first thing i did was to install the screen protector.  the installation has quite a few steps, but their video is pretty good.  just be careful, go slow, and you should be fine.  i have a few tips for the install:

1 - put a piece of paper or something under the jig to catch drips of adhesive.  it doesn't all stay contained under the screen protector and the absorption pads well...they mostly work but not all the way.

2 - after the adhesive is fully spread out under your protector, it is still pretty easy to move if you lightly press it.  this allows you to align it perfectly before curing.  however, if your surface is not level it can still move during curing.  also, the rubber block they have you place over the lower end can cause it to move slightly.  so i recommend after removing the block but before starting the curing process, realign the top-to-bottom position if you need and make sure it's level.

3 - the speaker cover sticker is a bit of a pain since the sticker portion is so thin.  you might use a toothpick to help stick it down over the speaker.  though with that said, it didn't look like any adhesive went anywhere near the speaker, but better safe than sorry.

4 - if you're going to use a case, install the phone in your case first and then place the screen protector on the phone to see how it fits before removing the back sticker on the protector.  this will let you see if there are any problems.

i had heard of problems with the unicorn beetle cases and it's true still with the s23 ultra and whitestone combo.  there is not quite enough room in the corners for the protector to fit, but again the case doesn't extend enough to completely cover and ""hold down"" the edges of the protector.  i would bet that if i had put my phone into the ub pro case it would have caused the protector to start pulling away from the phone.

i am using a poetic spartan case and it fits perfectly!  it doesn't touch the protector and so far there are no signs of any problems.  also the poetic revolution looks like it should work.  so check your case fit first, it either needs to not touch or have enough overlap to be putting downward pressure evenly across the protector, though i suppose that could also cause issues.  best bet is not touching at all imo.

installation went well with no issues, so you should be fine taking into account the tips above.  go slow, watch the video a few times to make sure you're comfortable with all the steps.

fingerprint!  it works just fine and it's fast.  no problems at all for me so far.

it looks great, can't really tell that it's on the screen.  there are a few dots around the edge of the protector that you will see when it's not installed.  i don't notice them at all.  not sure what they are for, but you can't see them after installation.

it does get fingerprints, but i'm not sure it's any better/worse than the regular phone glass.  so far i'm quite happy with it.  no, i'm not going to be doing any intentional drop tests lol.

i also got the whitestone camera lens protector kit, which was super easy to install and works great as well.

no, i have no affiliation with whitestone, poetic or supcase.  i just wanted to get some details out for anyone else who might be interested in what options are available.  i do also like amfilm protectors, i had one on my old phone (s20+), but the unicorn beetle interfered with it and i ended up just using a film on it instead of the tempered glass, but have been running the phone with no protector for about a year now and it's been fine also.

side note, the s20+ w/ unicorn beetle pro case is not really that much smaller than the s23u with the poetic spartan."
"over 5 week delivery time? i ordered a burgundy zfold4 on jan 12 with a delivery date of jan 21. never arrived. i saw it takes 3-4 weeks for that color so alright- but here we are at 5 weeks and i still don't have a delivery date. i've contacted samsung a bunch and they still don't have any solid updates- just to ""give them another week"" and it should be here. the burgundy is now out of stock on the website so that worries me (it was in stock yesterday).

"samsung s23 ultra smart view cover wallet case has a terrible design flaw... there seems to be a design flaw for the new smart view wallet case for the s23 ultra. the flap that encloses the card, that microbial plastic, is sharp. the fact that it is not aligned with the edge of the dip for accommodating the card means that it juts out when closed. i am glad i put a screen protector on it immediately when i received because there is a small scratch in the screen protector already due to that sharp flap. 
[issue illustrated](https://i.imgur.com/w5beuum.jpg)
overall it is a great case but i think i am going to modify it to remove that wallet flap and add a microfiber liner to protect the screen further. i mean, the main reason why you get a cover is to protect the screen; if it isn't doing that well, what's the point?"

"trying to decide whether to get an s23u today us here, i know the pre-order specials end today so i was trying to do some last minute brainstorming on whether to get an s23u (now).
like many here i used to do the pre-order every year and trade in my previous device but samsung nerfed the trade-in values, accessory credits, heck even the $25 total discount from last year for doing the 4-payment system.
so anyways, i was clicking around on ebay to see what people were selling their used s22u's for and it's a mixed bag.

then i went ""alright fine, i'll do it"" but then everything i could use ""accessory-wise"" is sold out. we have gw4's so we don't need new watches but even most of the gw5/pro variations are sold out. the rugged gadget case is sold out, the (new) 45w chargers are sold out, the 10,000mah 25w pd battery packs are sold out... i can't think of anything else to get to use up the accessory credit

i really wanted to wait to see what the next sales will be but the kicker is the free storage upgrade that's currently available. every other year it wouldn't have mattered but samsung this year lowered the base ram of the s22u to 8gb and i normally use more than 8 with regular use. so for this version i would need the 512 version (which i hate by the way cuz i usually hover around 100gb usage for like the last 6 years...).

s22 and s23 ultra it‚Äôs okay if i buy the s22 ultra now or i‚Äôm gonna miss a lot on s23 ultra? the gap is almost 500 euros here in italy and yes the s22 is on exynos. is the snapdragon 8 gen 2 really a big difference? i‚Äôm coming from iphone 13 btw and i‚Äôm really interested making a switch
"back to samsung i don't know who needs to hear this, but i'm back to samsung from iphone 12. apple is just not my thing. i will get my s23 on saturday. 

my last samsung phone was s10e -- a great little phone which i still use occasionally and which is still being regularly updated."
"how big does the ultra feel compared to the plus? i am looking to go from an s10+ to an s23 ultra.. has anyone else gone from the plus series to the ultra series? how did that little bit of extra size feel?  the s10+ has been the perfect size for me, but i really would like to go top of the line with the new ultra.  just nervous it might be too big."
"an interesting topic. someone asks to borrow your phone to make a call, you hesitate, then hand it to them.

let's say you want to show someone a picture, video, or so they can read something. you hand it to them. you legally give them access to everything inside.

"the s23 ultra + sd8g2 is a perfect combination! so i'm on the journey to test max screen on time on the s23u. i can firmly say this sd8g2 is very efficient. with the help of galaxymaxhz app, i can enable battery saving mode, light profile, extra dim, adaptive refresh from 10-120hz, and is a big difference in what the screen is consuming. i'm looking to get 9-10h screen on time with medium-mixed usage. all this having wi-fi, bluetooth, mobile data, location, and nfc turned on. considering the chip is only running at probably a max of 65% capacity with tweaks, there is no lagging, maybe slightly when unlocking with fingerprint reader, but is very responsive."

"traded my z fold 4 for an s23 no regrets i've been using the fold 4 since october and when i first got the phone i was hyped like everyone else, but after a couple months man i was missing a regular phone. now don't get me wrong if you love big phones this is awesome, but for someone with small hands and someone who likes using a device one handed this wasn't it for me. it's to bulky, to heavy to carry around and i didn't open it as much as i thought i would. so i was looking to see which samsung phone i wanted to switch to and all i see is s23 ultra ultra ultra. i haven't seen any regular s23 reviews that much and i think we get caught up in the hype of these big phones that once you get them and use it everyday you realize the size is a bother. so for me i picked up a s23 cream color and i gotta say i don't see myself picking up a big phone for a while. it's a nice break from a big phone. so i'm excited to use this bby and i don't regret it at all. don't get blinded by the hype guys. :)"

"resolution s23+ hi everyone!  


thinking of buying an s23+ as i'm finally able to buy the snapdragon version but i'm a little worried about the fhd+ display. if i'm correct it's only around 393 ppi so i do wonder if you notice the difference? my iphone 13 even has more ppi, around 460 and i like how crisp and sharp it looks.  
i can buy the 512gb version for ‚Ç¨929.  
another option would be to buy the ultra but i fear it's too big for me (coming from an iphone 13 and have small hands) and don't like curved displays. the ultra acutally would be cheaper because i also wanted to buy the watch 5 and since that's included with the ultra i would save ‚Ç¨21 (‚Ç¨1099 for the ultra and the watch 5 costs ‚Ç¨191)  


thanks!"
"s23u: glas screen protector that is compatible with an otterbox defender case? like everyone else, i upgraded my phone (note 20 ultra) and i need a screen protector. that posed a challenge with the note because none fit with the case. the only ones that worked were those film types and i hated the feeling, so i removed it. my note developed a handful of deep scratches over the years and i was hoping to prevent that with the 23. 
so i ask if you know if there's any screen protector that will fit."
just a bit of a heads up for those of you that now have 45w charging capabilities you can't take advantage of super fast charging without a 100w cable. your old cables will do just fine but you won't be getting the most out of it without 100w
how do you disable/mute the discord outgoing call dial sound on samsung i know this might not be completely related but i want to disable it. they force it to be an actual phone call so it can't be muted from sound settings but i really want it gone as it drives me crazy. anybody know how? i can't find a solution anywhere

"why does samsung use hiya for spam check? it's useless, i'd rather prefer truecaller embedded into it samsung uses hiya service as default for spam call check, it always shows suspected spam and i've set to always block all spams, since the call is ""suspected"" it rings and annoys everytime.

"noticed a lot of new s23/+/ultra users. just wanted to provide a small tip when you get your new phone the screen is made from an updated material. so it's more shatter resistant but that also means it's more prone to micro abrasions. some folks on reviews have gotten micro abrasion pretty quick all over the screen while babying the device 

if you want to ensure a micro scratch free device just a note to be extra careful or apply a screen protector right away if possible and for the folks that go no screen protector well won't matter there. enjoy the new phone folks"
"second full day of use coming from my iphone as mentioned, this is the second full day of use. 

thoughts: 

performance:
the phone has been more than snappy and i have yet to see any lag, glitches, etc. coming from an iphone 12 pro max, which has been remarkably powerful even to date, it has been more than powerful enough for *my* use 

software:
i'm somewhat new to android, so keep my bias in mind. the android software has been more than snappy, so not really an issue with that. but coming from ios, which i've enjoyed a lot, it's been different. obviously. i did enjoy how ios was simple and seemingly easier to navigate. but that's my opinion as someone only two days into a new os. it's different but not bad at all

battery: 
this is pretty high on my priorities. while i'm not a power user, my phone is always doing something. i work in the automotive industry in quality and i am constantly using my phone to take photos, record measurements, use as a calculator, and more. and when i'm home i listen to a lot, watch some videos, browse around, etc. i consider myself the average user plus a little more. for the last few days of use, my use has been average plus probably an extra 30 minutes of screwing around. checking on my old phone, the last few day's screen on time has matched my rolling average on my phone. i've linked a google drive folder at the bottom of the post for a screenshot. as of right now i have 5:01 screen on, 6:40 screen off and am at 41%. the phone says 11:42 used, with 7:18 left. i'm more than happy! i do also have the 45w anker charger and it was a full charge in just slightly over an hour. so the average power user should be more than fine. obviously, my continued use will show if this is true. 

camera:
i use my camera a lot. i take a lot of photos for work, of trips, my jeep, and more,  and i have the 38,000 photos to prove it.  so a decent camera is another high priority. for quick photos, it seems to be perfect. snap a picture and there it is! has done well in low light, shutter lag has been reasonable, and just generally happy. the pro raw mode has been a treat! i like how i have total control of iso, shutter speed, focus, and more. the focus is pretty cool how it'll highlight the in-focused areas a neon green. i like making videos in my free time and having this focus control makes even my proper dslr feel a bit out of date. not to say this will replace the considerably larger sensor, better zoom, and dedicated controls of it. but it will absolutely make me reach for the phone in my back pocket over the dslr in my bag more often. tonight i put my phone on my portable stand, pointed it at the sky, adjusted the focus, set iso to 100, shutter speed to 30s, and took a pic of the night sky! this was a 50mp photo and unedited, also part of the link below. i was very impressed with the long exposure. there was considerable light pollution in my area, so keep that in mind. but in this singular use case, i firmly believe i couldn't have taken a better photo on my proper dslr. i'm going camping next weekend and look forward to testing then. i love the camera. not too much of a fan with the pro raw being a separate app. i wish it was baked into the camera app. but eh, whatever. 

do i regret swapping from my iphone 12 pro max to the s23 ultra? not as of right now! it's a snappy phone, has proven to have a good battery, camera is great, and proving to be a solid phone. there's a few nuances that are different coming from my iphone, but i'll adjust just fine.

the link is in a comment, couldn't add it here. keep in mind that there is some photo compression here. it looks more clear on the device"
"[s23 ultra battery life] 12h sot with 720p/1080p res, light mode performance plan, ram plus off and 60hz. [so i decided to see how far i could push it and i managed to hit 12h screen on time.](https://i.imgur.com/vyndzcb.jpg)

i was on wifi 90% of the time and screen brightness was still on adaptive 

* resolution was set to 720p or 1080p for youtube
* motion smoothness was set to standard
* performance profile was set to light and adaptive battery was on
* ram plus was turned off too but i am not sure how big the battery impact is tbh.
* sync was enabled and power saving mode was only used in the last 15%

i'm tempted to do another run with full 720p mode, screen brightness set to as low as possible and having the phone in airplane mode and wifi only with power saving mode.

---

but i am very surprised about the battery life, i am currently getting about 9-10h screen on time with everything turned up so i am going to go back to that as it isn't that much of a hit on battery. coming from a sony xperia 1 iv which i returned because it struggled to hit 6-7h sot, i am glad i held out for the s23 ultra."

"how does the samsung care+ with loss / theft actually work for loss or theft? i've been researching this online for the last day or so and i can't find a good answer. seems like a good thing to have documented for anyone considering buying the protection plan.

the website is very vague, it only says you'll be covered and have to pay a deductible. but i want specifics. do you have to file a police report? in the case of loss, do you return the original device if it is later recovered and would they cover that shipping cost? and what happens to that device, can they remotely lock it as a stolen device so even if ""lost"" someone finding it can't get into my old device? or would it still function?

i'd like it very much if someone who's actually gone through the process could lay out the steps and expectations for myself and anyone else googling this in the future, so we can go in eyes wide open knowing the process for a claim. thanks!"

"ordered the s23 ultra, samsung cancelled it, but the at&t website says i have a pending contract hey all,

i preordered the s23 ultra coming from the s20 ultra on the samsung website around three days ago. i received an e-mail very early on the 15th of february saying my ordered was cancelled, seemingly for no reason. i went to go check on the at&t website and now it says i have a contract pending for the s23 ultra that is not being shipped to me. i tried googling and looking a few things up on the subreddit, but couldn't find definitive answers.

"s23 vs s23 ultra i could get the s23 base model with 256gb for 715‚Ç¨ and the s23 ultra 512gb for 1050‚Ç¨.
i could also get the s23+ for 930‚Ç¨ but this doesn't seem to make sense in my opinion.

so i am debating between the base model and the ultra.
i am in love with the small form factor of the s23 but the extra 335 for the better camera, display, battery, storage and resale value seem like a no-brainer.

i think even if i decide to sell the ultra after 1 month bc it turned out to be too big for me, i could make money out of this deal. am i wrong?

how would you choose?"

"zfold 3 to s23u after one week and i am glad i made the switch and whoever thinks that s23u is a boring phone think again. i had the zfold 3 since launch and i loved the fold concept and looks since i took it out of the box. i enjoyed so much the ability to read books, browse the web, games and multitask. i initially used the fold spend a lot but since i couldn't figure out a way to keep it with me it went into the drawer and just forgot about it.

after using the zfold3 for a while i started to discover the negatives of owning a fold device 

1. typing experience, regardless of which screen the typing experience was always painful. tried different keyboards and ended up just using voice to dictate. 


2. battery life is horrible on average i used to get 4.5 sot. yes i can disable stuff to get a longer battery life but what's the point of having an expensive dive while i don't use all of its capabilities

3. i casually go on bike rides and i like to use my phone as navigation unfortunately with the zfold 3 it's impossible to mount a heavy device and with any bumps, the device will fall. so throughout my time with zfold 3 i couldn't take it on a bike ride. adding to this when going just jogging it not possible to keep the heavy device in your pocket cause it will keep bouncing around. 


4. i started a youtube channel and using the zfold 3 for taking videos actually exceeded my expectations however i couldn't figure out any gimbal tha5 can support this device 

5. apps are not optimized especially youtube when switching between screens and the performance of the device was just not there at times lags sometimes 

long story short zfold devices are a very productive devices however as you can see from above mentioned points it's not practical device. finally i started to notice that a lot of people on zfold forums complain that the inner screen get the death line or the split line whatever you want to call it.

therefore i placed my order the day s23u was announced. i initially thought ok i am back to normal phone and this is going to be boring. but after using the phone for almost a week this is by the most complete package phone i've ever used. 

1. performance check
2. battery life check 
3. lighter weight compared to zfold 3 sure it a larger huge device but i started to get used to it
4. typing experience check 
5. camer quadruple check. wow on the performance of these cameras. 
6. spen built-in check 

the list can keep going but in all fairness the most annoying thing about the s23 u compared to zfold 3 is the fingerprint scanner i prefer so much the one on the zfold 3 since it's a hardware button it worked 99% of the time. s23u is good but not as good as the zfold 3 and i hope samsung can just use hardware fingerprint scanners on the power button instead of under the display. 

the fold technology for me is still in r&d phase and requires lots of areas to improve while the s line has reached to level where you are going to get a consistent experience mature with no surprises and this is what i am experiencing with the s23u mature and a complete package."
"super fast charging base s23 does the phone not support super fast charging? my s22 shows super fast charging when i plug in. i'm using the same charger in my s23 and it's just ""fast charging"". i went into battery settings and there is no toggle on/off for super fast like on my s22. what gives??"

"s23u vs future galaxy fold i currently own a refurbished s22, but i always wanted to have ultra but was held back by the huge price barrier. 

at the same time, i love what samsung for fold and i feel, if they fix gap between 2 screen this year, next year they might work on making the phone wider and then finally an year after that they might finally decide to put in the awesome s23 ultra camera into the fold. further down the line, they might even decide to have a slot for a pen, too. 

the thing is, all things i wish for are already available in ultra, except it can not fold. i can not keep changing phones, but is it a wiser decision to go ahead with s23 u than waiting for a perfect galaxy fold?"

"s23 is love been using my s23 for the past 2 days and i simply love it.

coming from a european s22 (exynos) it is the remedy.

besides that eu relief, it's an amazing phone.

batterylife is stellar, i got roughly 6 hours of onscreen time out of it because i am on holiday excited to try my new phone and have time, compared to my measly 4 hours at mildly light usage (if at all most of the time) from the s22, given the highly light usage, it would double.

the s22 i've owned only for a month and managed to sell it without loss when the s23 launched (got it second hand new), originally coming from an s9+ which i broke myself through a work related accident (there was no need to upgrade, the s9+ was amazing), i'm so glad about the changes samsung made besides the european exynos problems. 

it's a huge step up even from the last chip and ai with essentially the same camera still does make a great difference. 

i mean, the gpu outperforms the iphone 14 pro max which has a dedicated silicon and is (depending whether it's the regular iphone 14 or pro / max) matching it's cpu performance / outperforming it in single core (1975 points i've had). it's so good to the point hat it almost has the same performance as an intel 8700k (whoever knows what that means), a still, very capable and powerful desktop cpu.

but yeah the battery life man, i have no words, same feeling, even better when i had my 9+ for the first time.

i think, given the underwhelming youtubers' reception of it as a mild update is just wrong.

they took what was great about the previous phone and perfected it. this phone will last you and will make you very happy both causal- and productivly.

i don't understand why it's been socially, on the internet, received so poorly, it's simply amazing, a powerhouse with refined features, great battery life and an outblasting performance. it basically is better than the current iphone being an android device.

it just goes to show how weird and affiliated today's ""influencers"" are, or possibly spoiled and don't get a clear picture of what's happening anymore.

if apple had been on a low for a while and managed to get on the same silicon level with better camera quality, it would flood your youtube search without even relevant context in between.

amazing to know and sad to see.

sorry for the exynos typo of correction."

i'm freaking out. are the batteries really that fragile that i need to follow an instruction book when charging? i am using the phone alot at the minute because i'm new to it and it's exciting so i'm always almost draining the battery but i'm scared to top it off during the day so i wait until i'm in bed charge it for an hour and then take it off. 

with my iphone i just used it and always charged overnight, it was fine. when do i charge this phone? i don't plan on keeping it for 5 years, 2 at most though but i don't want to break the battery in my first week. 

any help would be appreciated, thanks guys."
"the official samsung silicone cases for the s23 line are really nice. i picked up the samsung silicone grip case yesterday for my new s23 ultra, and it's great. i was worried about it feeling sticky, having problems putting it in my pocket, or having it get covered with dust, dead skin, etc. based on what i'd read about other silicone cases (including past samsung silicone cases), but i'm not having any of these problems.

the texture feels perfect. it feels soft compared to a tpu case, and it has enough grip to make the phone feel stable in my hand (even without using the strap). it doesn't make the phone feel bulky. (i actually feel like most modern phones are too thin, so the little bit of extra thickness feels good, but it doesn't add too much to the width of the phone.)

the strap is very sturdy. it easily keeps the phone attached to my hand even if i'm not holding it, but it doesn't get in the way when i'm holding the phone normally.

unless the material dramatically changes with wear, i don't anticipate it picking up dust or debris. i have the dark gray/black version, so it would be noticeable.

anyway, i hadn't found many reviews on this case, so i just thought i'd make a quick post for anyone who had similar concerns to mine. i can only compare this to a couple of other cases (the last being a spigen), but i'm quite pleased so far."
"new phone on the way, are you ready, is everything backed-up that you want to save/transfer to your new phone? do you trust a 3rd party to save everything you want saved? personally, i do not trust any 3rd party to back-up and save, what i've collected and put in the library of my phone. transferring the same knowledge from many years spent in the pc world, passed on from/to the start of getting my first smartphone. i created a filing tree system a librarian would be proud to see and search what's contained inside.

&#x200b;

as time passed, everything of importance, inside my phone, went into a relative folder within the tree. nice, clean and organized, which i am backing up from my s10+ onto my pc as i type. when the new s23+ arrives, i will transfer the files from the back-up, to the new smartphone.

the program and app i am using for pc and smartphone is smart switch.

to transfer the microsd info, this (to my knowledge, unless there is an application i'm unaware of) is done manually via the usb-c connection.

"galaxy s23 ultra review (from a fold 4/s22 ultra user) samsung does it again, as they always do.  

i change phones every 6 months. no phone has ever made me want to keep it for more than that time.  but the truth is, anyone shelling out the money to buy a flagship galaxy device is going to have a decent experience overall.  these are samsung's best phones and righfully so, they aren't cheap.   they can easily last you 3 to 4 years (even longer) if you're a responsible person that knows how to take care of things (using a decent case, screen protector, never drop it etc).

s23 ultra compared to the s 22 ultra

refined and improved in every way.  any weird quirk you found annoying about the s22 ultra has been fixed or addressed with the s23 ultra.  my biggest issues with it were battery life and speaker quality, which, compared to most other devices outside of the samsung eco system, is not even a problem.  but since we're knit picking here i'll mention them.  


s23 ultra compared to the z fold 4

the camera and processor of the fold 4 are starting to show their age (not really , but compared to the s23 ultra sure).  that's just from my preference on how i see this fold 4.  the sound on the fold 4 is better than the s22 ultra in terms of clarity, but it isn't as loud as the s22 ultra.  the s23 ultra sounds much better than the fold 4.  not by much but i do notice the difference.  much more clear at the loudest setting compared to the s22 ultra.  the fold 4 isn't loud enough for my taste.  and even though the camera is decent on the fold 4 i can tell it's not as quality which hurts it. 

the unfolded display is the fold 4's saving grace.  even with the crease it's pleasant to use.   but the front display is a tragic joke, barely usable.  samsung needs to hurry up and make that front display the same size as the ultra devices.  having a 6.8 display in the front and then being able to unfold it for a tablet size...that's my game over scenario for how samsung takes over the cell phone market.  

the chinese phone makers already have a foldable phone that's similar to what i'm talkng about, i can't remember the name but it's also very thin.  the technology is there but samsung is getting more and more like apple with how long they'll hold off to give people what they really want.  

the fold user interface has finally caught up to regular phone layout quality interface.  it's much more intuitive and isn't just a bigger version of what you would see on a regular phone.  they're actually utilizing the extra space.  the fold 3 had dogshit ui when it came out.  i look forward to seeing what sammy does with the fold 5.  they actually have decent competition with the chinese phone makers so i hope that makes them get off their asses and give us something decent (get rid of the crease, built in s pen, and bigger battery, and bigger front display...that's a tall list but i can dream),

the s23 ultra is tried and true.  i can't wait to see samsung refining and improving their foldables the same way they're doing with the galaxy regular phone line up.  i will miss the large screen of the fold 4, but i won't miss that front tiny display, it was unusable and i merely tolerated it because i could unfold it.  


big takeaways i'm noticing with the s23 ultra.  

samsung already has amazing wifi/connectivity/service.  but with each new phone it seems like they keep pushing the envelope even more.  wifi connects even smoother with this bad boy.  cell phone quality and blue tooth feel even more refined.  

also, moving all my info between devices has gotten even easier.  it took even less time to move everything over from my fold 4 to the s23 ultra.  

things just connect better/faster with the s23 ultra.  

samsung has the best quality control on the planet.  their phones are the best bang for the buck.  they aren't cheap but compared to apple you're going to get your money's worth."
"samsung upgrade [uk] - does the pre-order bonus (double storage) apply? has anyone been through the upgrade programme and got the double storage pre-order bonus? doesn't show when i go through in the basket.

edit: so you have to pick the bigger version and then it discounts it, rather than picking e.g. 256gb and getting a free 512gb upgrade, you have to pick 512gb and it discounts it to the 256gb price in the basket. really unclear. also it lets you add a 256gb.. without upgrading it, scummy."
anyone waiting until preorder window ends to purchase an s23u? i think i might wait to see if there's any better offers for trade in. does anyone have any idea if samsung will offer more for my z flip 4 after the pre order period? (currently only $350 smh) how have the previous years been handled? would you guys trade it in at best buy for $600 now or risk it for the biscuit? üòõ
"before opening the new s23+ the new phones arrived with a thick screen protector for shipping that came off very cleanly. had i thought it out before, i would have opened it and placed my screen protector immediately, avoiding any dust or a need to clean the screen of fingerprints and such. i wonder if it could also help with the finger print detection, since it would be ""calibrated"" to a print through the protector."
"is your s23u also a dust magnet? seriously, i can't even wipe it off with a cloth.
i had the s10+ before and this was not an issue"
"is it better to overcharge or just let your phone battery drain overnight? i rarely keep my battery below 50%. i usually start fast charging at 60-80%. phone's a 2020 samsung mid-ranger.

i charge it before i go to bed for around 7 hrs. at 60-80%, it would've been fully charged 1 hour into the 7 hrs, leaving 6 hrs of overcharging.

i've read somewhere on quora some time ago, that most smartphones now have safety measures against overcharging. not sure though

with that said, is it better for battery health to overcharge it, or just let it drain overnight while i'm asleep?"
"for people who got the s23 ultra, what settings have you changed to enhance your battery? just got the s23 ultra and i'm wondering if people are changing any settings to make this battery last this long. 

i've had the phone for maybe 10 hours and the battery isn't shockingly amazing (yet)"
"after months of headache dealing with samsung customer service i took them to arbitration and won a fair settlement. without going into too much detail, my washer broke while still under warranty for parts, but not repair labor or a refund.  however every call over 5 months resulted in ""we'll schedule service when we receive parts, but we don't know when we'll get parts.""  during that period i made a complaint to the better business bureau.  i wasn't really expecting much to come of it, because i always thought the bbb was useless. 
 however samsung responded to them, and after a lot of going back and forth with samsung and both of us updating the bbb on the case, the bbb proposed arbitration to come to a final resolution. 

samsung and i both agreed, and we went through a legally binding arbitration teleconference.  the arbiter decided that there was ""reasonable expectation"" that my washer would never be fixed and that i was entitled to a partial refund, which samsung paid in a reasonable timeframe."
"i‚Äôve seen nothing but praise for this phone i am ecstatic to be switching over from iphone 13 pro max,the s23 ultra seems to be better in every aspect."
"s23 ultra- switching from pixel 7 pro- the battery is amazing! i just received my s23 ultra yesterday- and even using it after a full charge for 6 hours today it is night and day from my pixel 7 pro. i am a pretty heavy phone user and 6 hours in i am at 76% with 2 hours of screen on time. normally with my 7 pro by this point i am close to 50%. i get my work slack notifications on my phone so i need to use it through the day. 

i know it's only day one and normally the battery gets better after the first few days- but i'm very happy with it's performance so far! if this keeps up- this will be the closest experience to an iphone battery wise i've ever had on android."
"just got my galaxy book3 pro 14"" ama haven't seen much talk about the 14"" model anywhere.  i just got mine, and am currently setting it up.  feel free to leave any questions and i'll try to get to them!

notes:

* i do a lot of computer hardware tinkering so i'm fairly familiar with many tools
* i don't plan on disassembling the device for the time being
* i'll post updates on this op as i find things

machine configuration: i7-1360p/16gb/1tb

findings:

* the hinge is difficult to open with one finger, but possible if there's enough friction on the bottom
* screen coating: glossy, not laminated
   * both adaptive color and auto brightness are supported
   * display hdr certification is displayhdr500 true black
   * refresh rate options are listed as ""dynamic (60 hz or 120 hz)""/120 hz/60 hz
   * dynamic mode seems to do a decent job of boosting up to 120 hz when needed (scrolling, moving mouse), but isn't quite as perfect as it is on a phone.  i definitely still notice some 60 hz in there.
* ssd model: wdsn740-sddpnqd-1t00-1004, seems to be a western digital sn740: [https://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/pc-sn740-ssd#sddpnqd-1t00](https://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/pc-sn740-ssd#sddpnqd-1t00), which is the oem version of the wd sn770
   * 5150/4900 read/write 740k/800k random
   * seems like it should be 2280, so bodes well for replaceability
   * as ssd (high power mode): [https://i.imgur.com/xtiamdb.png](https://i.imgur.com/xtiamdb.png),  [https://imgur.com/vsqebjs.png](https://imgur.com/vsqebjs.png)
   * afaik this is *the* fastest dram-less pcie4.0 ssd on the market.  the lack of dram makes this one of the most power- and energy-efficient nvme ssds, so i actually think this was a very good choice.
* ram timings: ddr5-5200 @ 60-48-48-112-160-1t, reporting as quad channel?
* power limits:
   * silent: pl1 = 20w, pl2 = 64w
   * quiet: pl1 = 20w, pl2 = 64w
   * optimized: pl1 = 28w, pl2 = 64w
   * high performance: pl1 = 28w, pl2 = 64w
* cinebench r20 scores (68f ambient, external monitor):
   * silent: 3395/642
   * quiet: 3344/665
   * optimized: 4092/665
   * high performance: ‚Äã4140/(didn't test)
* all single-core scores are effectively the same; expect similar single-thread performance in bursty workloads regardless of the mode.
* seems like there's not really any penalty for bursty workloads (even multi-core ones) for silent vs. quiet or optimized vs. high performance.  the difference between scores can likely be entirely attributed to the difference in pl1.
* silent mode really is silent for cinebench.  the fans never spun up at all.
* 3dmark scores (68f ambient, external monitor, high performance mode, driver version 31.0.101.4032):
   * timespy: 1977/1750 graphics/7556 cpu:  [generic vga video card benchmark result - intel core i7-1360p processor,samsung electronics co., ltd. np940xfg-kc1us (3dmark.com)](https://www.3dmark.com/3dm/89308474?)
   * firestrike: 5500/5939 graphics/19000 physics/2100 combined:  [generic vga video card benchmark result - intel core i7-1360p processor,samsung electronics co., ltd. np940xfg-kc1us (3dmark.com)](https://www.3dmark.com/3dm/89308670?)
   * this is a bit faster than the steam deck's performance, so i would use that as a rough gauge if you're interested in gaming on this laptop.
   * closest desktop gpu i could find is the gt 1030
   * don't expect miracles, but it should be serviceable for 900p gaming (integer scaling on the 2880 x 1800 display) at 30\~60 fps on modern games.  should handle lighter weight games easily at full resolution at 120 fps.
* samsung update showed three things to install: samsung system support service, windows configuration, and camera driver
* camera is *extremely* wide angle.  if i had to guess maybe around 18mm?  quality seems good for a laptop webcam
* protect battery is available in samsung settings which limits battery charging to 85%
* yes mcafee is preinstalled :(
* there are 3 keyboard backlight brightness settings (+ off = 4 total)
* best fitting sleeve i've found so far is the 14"" invzi macbook sleeve
* keyboard travel is extremely shallow with a very distinct detent.  not a huge fan so far, but maybe it will grow on me.  at first blush, i'm not typing very well."
"are samsung 8k tvs really 8k? since my post yesterday was kindly deleted because it appeared as a support question. i'm rephrasing and would like to start a discussion on whether samsung's 8k displays are actually 8k displays or if they are hiding pretty relevant information from it's customers.

we recently bought an samsung qn700b and it shows very ugly checkerboard patterns, see [https://www.reddit.com/r/monitors/comments/112co8s/checker\_board\_pattern\_at\_pixel\_level\_in\_samsung/](https://www.reddit.com/r/monitors/comments/112co8s/checker_board_pattern_at_pixel_level_in_samsung/) that some call dithering or contrast modulation ([https://www.reddit.com/r/monitors/comments/112ddqe/comment/j8lwibe/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/monitors/comments/112ddqe/comment/j8lwibe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). sorry for the link, i can't seem to add picture here.

"share ideas for using the s pen samsung note/ultra/tab users, how do you use the s pen? do you use it much? is it important for you?

for me, it's indispensable because it's basically a mouse for my s22u. helps with editing photos and videos, taking selfies and group photos, hover to translate is extremely helpful, and selecting text anywhere.

perhaps most importantly for me is creating notes with chemical formulas of organic compounds and annotating carbon atom numbers within them and functional groups would've been impossible without the s pen.

finally, studies show that handwriting, as opposed to typing on a keyboard, is better for learning and memory:

"high quality real leather cases (s23u)? anyone know of a company that makes really nice full leather cases?

"bixby routines not stopping after oneui 5.1 update. hi guys, so i am currently using s21 ultra and after the one ui 5.1 update bixby routines are not stopping on their own after the task ends like i have to manually end them. is anyone else facing a similar issue?"
"these are the reasons i chose the s23 (8gb/256gb) i've been using the s23 since 4th february and i can tell you it is worth it!

**- price and where i bought it**

i bought it on amazon business (spain), for 912,84‚Ç¨ (23% vat included, ¬†742,15‚Ç¨ no vat), and it came with a 45w wall charger and 2 usb cables. i used the promo code samsungs23 to get 103‚Ç¨ of discount. by law, in portugal and spain we have 3 years of mandatory warranty. i made the order on the presentation day and it was delivered on the 4th of february. i had no problems since i could return it for free if i didn't want it or if the reviews were really bad!

**- previous smartphone and why i no longer use it**

my previous smartphone was the poco f2 pro 8gb/256gb from 2020. at the time and in terms of price/performance ratio, it was one of the best. unfortunately, after 2 years and 2 months, it never turned on again. also, in 2020, the mandatory warranty for these devices was only for 2 years. there is no luck getting them fixed for free. since this smartphone is plagued with problems with its flex cable, i tried to change it and also the battery didn't work either. it was bricked. i sold it for pieces. not everything was lost, at least.¬†

another thing that i disliked was its software! don't get me wrong, but miui is nice and easy to deal with, but in order to get all of its functions and updates on time (especially the security ones) i had to install xiaomi.eu rom (which is based on the official china rom and no harm done to it's warranty). sometimes it came with a lot of bugs and we had to rollback the update or only use the stable version. one really bad point was the fact it was only supported for 2 years! even the camera app was bad imo, most of the time i used a modded gcam

physically, the screen was nice, nothing great, but in terms of quality it didn't disappoint me when i was watching media content, only its refresh rate (60hz) was starting to bother me. the front camera was a motorized pop-up and i never had a problem with it. it had a 3.5mm jack and the infrared port was really useful and these were the main specs/features i'm missing. the battery was a monster!

what i couldn't get used to was the size, weight, dim screen brightness when in direct sunlight, somewhat mediocre fingerprint scanner (especially with a glass screen protector, lack of water and dust protection, no wireless charging, bad sound quality...

as a substitute, while i was waiting for the s23 and for 3 months, i used the legendary samsung galaxy gio from 2011! with removable battery and fm radio!! never forget what they took from us...

**- what were my options?**

* samsung galaxy s23
* samsung galaxy s23+ (same as s23, uwb support, awesome battery life, but its size is a disadvantage for me and it was more expensive, good heat dissipation)
* asus zenfone 9 (very good reviews all around and one of the best smartphones of 2022, has 3.5mm jack, nice design, zenui is near stock android, no wireless charging, but the big no was the fact that it only has 2 years of os support)
* pixel 7 (this one was the main competitor for me. it's also an awesome device, slightly heavier and bigger as it sits between s23 and s23+, 700‚Ç¨ for the 8gb/256gb version, great camera quality for a smartphone, nice stock experience with zero bloatware updates, pixel devices, the first to try out new os versions and to update, 3 years of os update and 5 of security patchs. why didn't i go for it? the tensor chipsets still do not have my trust in the long term and for emulating, ""only"" 90 hz refresh rate (not dynamic), certain software and hardware features are regionally limited.
* oneplus 11(bigger and heavier than s23+, only ip64, great display, os support equals samsung with 4 years of os support and 5 years of security patches, wifi 7, usb type c 2.0 (wtf?), awesome battery life, fast charging (1-100% in 25 min), but damn oxygenos is just coloros at this point, i miss some oneplus past features.

\- **the choosen one**

samsung s23. it has everything i need

* light and compact, damn i was tired of having a ""brick"" inside my pocket. now, for some sports and outdoors activities, i'm not always thinking i have something limiting my movements and discomforting. holding it, scrolling and writing effortlessly with one hand makes me appreciate it even more, it feels natural.¬†
* love the screen. ¬†dynamic, 120hz and 1750 nits (peak), i can see everything under the sunlight (here i'm mainly comparing it to poco f2 pro). smooth! damn, i love moving things and scrolling. with the poco f2 pro, by itself, 60hz was not a problem... but when i used my pc display (at 165hz) and had to pick up my smartphone, i always ""twisted my nose"" in disgust. the difference was too big for my liking. once you go with fast refresh rate displays it is hard to go back.
* in terms of hardware, it's packed with some of the latest guns! snapdragon 8 gen 2 slightly overclocked, ufs 4.0, ¬†the only thing i think we should have more is ram. at least give us 12gb of ram!!! my emulators are working beautifully (and streaming). unfortunately, it throttles a little bit under some very heavy tasks, since the s23 is so compact it lacks the heat dissipation the s23+ has!
* ip68 is a good plus! i will not use it to take underwater photos, but having that protection in case something happens, i will be more reassured. i cannot test the gorilla glass victus 2 and the tougher (advertised) and scratch resistant body armor... i use a glass screen protector and a case. (more on that below)
* the cameras are not the best, for that, you must choose something like s23 ultra or the pixel 7 pro. since i take most of my photos with my mirrorless sony a7 iv, i was not in need of the top of the line camera phone. nevertheless, it has potential! i still did not test some modified gcam app, but samsung has everything and processes its images at a very good level! i will test just to see if it differs. when we talk about the main camera, pixel 7 is still a small step ahead i think (i need to test it more).
* the battery is another great point here! better than zenphone 9, which was my reference for compact smartphones. not as fast charging as oneplus devices. this one only goes up 25w when charging with a cable and 15w wireless. i always charge only up to 85% and i try to never go below than 15-20%. i'm not having a problem since i have a very good sot! once i do a complete test (100% to zero) i will update this with the results.
* 912‚Ç¨ is not cheap!!! if you can wait for a decent sale, do so! at least i got a 45w wall charger with it and 2 usb cables (one that came inside the s23 box and another inside the charger box)
* ¬†the under-display ultrasonic fc is accurate and fast. i use a glass screen protector and i have no problem with it, it works almost 100% of the time.¬†
* its loud speakers have so much quality when compared to the poco f2 pro. i can also compare it to how it sounds versus the iphone 14 and iphone wins, but only on the lower frequencies gsmarena has a nice chart about it. the call sound quality is also very good! does not have the 3.5mm jack port, for some this is a big stepback, but for me it's not so bad since i use wireless earbuds most of the time... still think there is enough space for it.
* in terms of software, in the past, samsung has been infamous. and this was the point i as more afraid! i still remember using my note 3 with touchwiz and the difference it made once i put it with a custom rom. performance with one ui 5.1, when compared to the previous versions, improves the experience to a pleasant and natural feeling and i just hope it keeps getting better as time goes on. nothing to be afraid! but it can get better, samsung should not be afraid of making it more lightweight!

to end this, i always use it with a case and screen protector. i have no problems with spigen liquid air case and ez fit glas.tr (fc works as normal). hope this helps some of you. will update this once my experience changes or i have more info."

i have a romoss 30k mah battery with display. it has 18w fast charging capability. but my s22+ only seems to draw 5w from the battery pack. [if youre familiar with this battery pack product, u know u can just click twice to see the a and v power being used at the moment]

*sometimes, it draws 15w, but only when the display is off which is weird. moment i press the power button (asin turn on the display), it goes back to 5w. i use the original c to c samsung cable that came with the phone. i also used a different c to c cable, same thing. i also did use original multiple c to usb a cables and same thing.

"advice for streaming media files to samsung 2022 smart tv hi everyone,

i'm looking for advice on how to stream media files to my samsung 2022 smart tv. i currently use a flash drive and a fire stick to watch my downloaded files, but i'd like to have a more convenient and streamlined way to do this. ideally, i want to be able to torrent files and watch them on my tv through an app on the tv's operating system.

one of my main concerns is being able to wirelessly transfer the files from my computer to my storage solution, or even torrent directly onto a remote server or flash drive that's already available to the tv. additionally, it would be great if i could wirelessly delete files from that storage solution as well.

i'm not sure if this is possible or what software/hardware solutions would be best for achieving this. if anyone has experience with this or knows of any good resources for setting this up, i would greatly appreciate any advice you could offer. thank you in advance!"

s23 ultra best/essential apps just got the ultra. just wondering what apps you think are a must. especially s/pen apps. also what games are good using the pen aswll
"question about returning s23 ultra. not getting full refund so i decided against the s23 ultra and started a return. the email is stating i'm getting -$173 in adjustments.

i contacted samsung, they said it's because of the buds i chose to get with the $150 in accessories so i requested a return label for the buds too. (initially thought returning the phone would have the buds included in the return) the buds refund is $14.82.

i was assured i'd get my full refund if i included the buds and the separate buds return label in the box with the phone return.

i'm really paranoid about this. i won't be getting a full refund, will i?"
"s23 has horrible data connection, wouldn't recommend so i just recently upgraded from a s10+ to a s23 base model and my data speeds have been horrendously bad after switching.
usually i have 4g min and almost 2 bars everywhere but right after putting the sim in the phone i had almost no connection at all and the i'm lucky to get e if anything at all.
even upgraded my dataplan to included 5g to no evail...
if you live in an area where you aren't surrounded by 5g towers you probably won't be able to use your phone effectively.
if this issue continues i might just switchback to a bigger storage s10+..

(yes i did turn it off and on again)"
"s23u sim card not detected. i received my s23u yesterday. i pre-ordered through verizon. i started the set up process but it is not detecting a sim card. i have made sure the card is in there and correct. will it not work until the 17th? is there something i am missing? 

tia

update: so, something is wrong with my sim card tray. had to take it into the store, and they could not get it to detect any sim card. they set it up using an esim only, and that worked."
"at&t stole my phone and stuck me with big monthly bill i've been given the run around for the past year. i bought my new s22 ultra under the trade in offer that was going at the time ($800 off if i trade in my old s7 edge) i liked my old phone but thought it sounded like a good deal and they managed to convince me that i'd barely be paying any more a month for a much newer model. 

so i agreed to a 3 years contract and shipped off my old phone. 
 i was told that it would take a few months for my phone to be received and after that my bill should drop down from $88 a month to something around $50. 
 around 3 months passed and still no change to my bill. so i called up at&t and asked what the issue was. they told me my phone was never shipped so my bill remained the same. 
i told them that was nonsense because i'd shipped it months ago and gave them the tracking number that said it had been delivered. 
 they spent some time figuring things out and eventually 'located' my phone at a warehouse in texas. the rep told me everything should be fine and that it was their mistake. my account was going to be credited with the money. 

some time passes and my bill still hasn't changed. so i call them up again and they tell me it takes a couple months to take effect.  so i wait another three months. 

nothing. 

so i call them up again and they tell me 'your account isn't an unlimited plan so we can't credit you.'.. 

what do you mean it's not an unlimited plan? how did that happen? i traded my phone in specifically so i could get an unlimited plan at a discount? 

'but it took you longer than 90 days to get your phone to us'

obviously that isn't true. they just lost my phone and couldn't find it in time. so i talk to a supervisor who told me the kicker. 

there is no sign of my phone ever being sent. even with my tracking number. even though the other guy said he'd found it. 

so i asked them to do something about it and they launched an investigation which i had to wait 5 days to hear the conclusion of. so i called them again. 

they rejected my claim. 

i sat on the phone for 2 hours with a supervisor trying to find my phone. he was super nice. he couldn't believe what the notes on my case was saying. he told me it was my right to get the money for my phone and that i did nothing wrong. it ended up being that all he could do further was to get me an exception for the price of the trade in value of the phone. which at&t had valued at... $35. 


so after all that. at&t have my phone and i'm stuck paying them $88 a month for a phone i didn't even really want in the first place. 

has this happened to anyone else? i feel completely powerless. is there nothing i can do? i feel like this needs a class action lawsuit."

"aod notifications hi, previously i was using a oneplus phone and when a notification arrived it was able to display it on the aod as a simple text (ie white on black) so i could just glance over the screen and see what was happening. however one oneui, as far as i can tell there's no such way to display the notifications when they come in, am i right?  
so do you guys have a solution so i can visualize the incoming notifications without having to turn the display on?"
"question about delivery for the s23u pre order i placed a pre order for the s23u graphite version on samsung.com on feb 7th. samsung also let me pick a delivery date, which was feb 18th. they then sent me an email confirming my order, with the feb 18 date highlighted as well.
today is the 15th. right now, on samsung website, it's still possible to cancel my order as the status is still processing. i'm really confused if i'm gonna get it delivered on the 18th or not.
also, after a bit of browsing, the website now shows that the online exclusive variants may take 3 to 5 weeks to arrive. i only get more confused.
this is gonna be my first ultra phone ever, and also first preorder experience ever from samsung so i'm really excited, and with that, kinda anxious. please don't mind if this seems irrational to any of you lol

i should also add that i live in vn, and during check out, samsung says delivery takes 0-3 days in my area."
"cool difference between s21 and s23 ultra the power is quite impressive. most notably i can run split screens and pop up windows without my phone getting hot at all. that way i can watch tokyo revengers while typing this post. 

the s21 handled it decently but it always got hot.

i don't remember having opacity feature either. so i can turn the video or window transparent.

my brother wanted a cheap phone. i got him a samsung a7(i think) and despite being brand new the speed is terribly slow. i definitely recommend sticking with a flagship, even if it is older."
any popsocket alternatives that will stick to the bare back of the s23 ultra popsocket sticks well on a note 20 ultra but not on the s23 ultra. i'm guessing it's because of the matte finish on the s23 ultra compared to the smooth back of the note 20 ultra. any alternatives? i do not want to use a skin or case.

did my order get canceled? so i recently checked my bank account and i saw that i was given my money back for my order. the weird thing is though is that the samsung website says that my order is still in progress. i also never got a cancelation or a refund email from them. does it mean they'll charge me when i go and pick it up from best buy as i made it my preferred delivery option? sorry im new to this pre ordering thing

the pen is incredible. i'd never used one up until now, and it is very cool. being able to write like a pencil on paper and have it show up in text is unbelievable. 

i'm just getting started on this phone, so i'll likely have more in the space of a few days. thus far, call it mcdonald's, because i'm loving it."

with the unlocked model, i can (potentially) benefit more freedom to roam other providers if necessary. 

i also stuck with otterbox, and got the defender pro case.

you guys got any ideas?"
"swapping my red samsung 23 ultra i received my red s23 ultra yesterday, but will be returning it for a different color.  i just did not like it at all in person.  in fact i kind of, and i don't use the word lightly, hate it. disappointing.

i like red, i like orange even more and i love a good burnt orange.  so i was open to quite a few different shades in that realm, but this ""red"" in person... the best i can describe it is a terracotta pot crossed with salmon.  imho, not attractive.  i even have a professionally calibrated monitor for work, it just did not come across the same way as in person.  

i was planning on using some semi clear cases if anyone is wondering. even full cases a lot of time show around the camera area with a brighter color.

"rakuten not honoring samsung cashback so i've been using rakuten for years without issue for the most part. a few months ago i used rakuten for some cashback purchases through samsung. in total i was supposed to receive around $600 in cashback from all of my online purchases, most from samsung. and all of my cashback was tracked and approved up until the day rakuten sent out the check, then it went from the $600 i was supposed to receive to $6 total. i contacted rakuten and this is the message they sent back:

""we checked on your samsung orders and it looks like your cash back amount was adjusted because part of your orders were not eligible for cash back.

* a non-rakuten coupon was used. to be safe, stick to codes provided by rakuten.""

i have used ""non-rakuten"" coupons in the past and it didn't impact my cashback. so this must be a new way for rakuten to scam customers out of their cashback, because i guarantee that rakuten still received their cut from samsung, otherwise what difference does it make if the coupon is from rakuten or not.

edit: rakuten is now saying that it is samsung that denied the cashback. which makes no sense because the cashback tracked and was approved for months, up until it was payday, then suddenly nearly all of my cashback balance disappeared."

"s21 - 72gb of 128gb used by system? hi guys, 

i heard the recent chatter on new s23's shipping with 50+gb allocated toward system storage. there's been commentary about it possibly being bloatware, or possibly being a discrepancy in gb vs gib, or some of it being allocated toward wear leveling. it sounds like models with more storage generally have more allocated for system, about 10-15%, so the gb vs gib or wear leveling allocation are plausible.

i've ordered the new s23 and it should be here this weekend, but i decided to take a look at my current s21. almost 72gb, yes seventy two gigabytes out of 128gb are allocated toward system memory. that's 56%! 

just to make sure it's not a *me* issue, i checked my wife's s21, and she's at almost 68gb of 128gb,  which comes out to 53%. 

screenshots of both:
https://imgur.com/a/xyoyyu9

any ideas, anyone? what are you guys seeing on s21's?

also, *what the hell*, samsung?

edit:

disregard. after allowing permissions to separate system files from apps, it's now reporting a much more reasonable 28gb for system. still a bit on the high side in general, but nowhere near as alarming.

however, please make note of the imgs below... the delivery service that ee has selected (dpd) did not bubble wrap nor package the phone in any way that could be considered even remotely reasonable/protective. dpd merely placed the phone in a plastic bag and had it shipped. as a result, the phone seems to have taken a pretty bad beating whilst in transit. 

the gentleman working at ee downplayed the issue, indicating that the phone is well protected inside the packaging. frankly speaking, i wasn't in the mood to put up an argument given that (a) i just got back into the uk from france (and am exhausted) and (b) this likely will get resolved by calling ee's customer service line (should i proceed to flag this as an issue). 

do you think i'm okay to open the phone up? ps - i hope i'm not coming across as dramatic, i just feel a ¬£1000+ device should be treated as such. 

any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"samsung is using predatory business practices to maintain a phone screen monopoly i was going to upgrade my phone to the 23ultra, did some research, and there is a very slim chance that i will ever buy another samsung product in my life. i know every tech company does shady things, but a forced monopoly is really crossing the line for me. i've been using samsung phones since 2013, and i love the customizable interface, but i simply can't condone this because of the harm something like this causes to consumers and small businesses. a company should succeed because of their products, not because they're abusing legislation. i loved samsung because they were a better company than apple, but really, they're worse. i'm going to get rid of my s22+ and note 20 ultra and never look back. i'm probably going to get a pixel. my gf loves hers, or maybe i'll go back to apple, idk yet. time to shop around. also, my gf had a flip for a short time, and the durability of that phone is horrendous. she takes immaculate care of her devices, and the screen starts peeling off after a few months. what a joke, especially when they make it so you can't even repair your own devices."

"s23 ultra - battery drain too fast? hey guys
i'm in love with the new s23 ultra. amazing camera and performance.

is it normal?
most background activitys are blocked and turned off.

any suggestions?

because reviews and so on says it has amazing battery life."

"i am about to throw my phone across my room last november i bought a galaxy a53 from an iphone to get out of their stupid ecosystem with my phone.

i actually really enjoyed android! until this new stupid ui update.

the update just feels clunky to me, and most importantly, they fucked up my notifications.

i like to have no sound notifications for my social media apps like discord and twitter.   
it was working fine until my phone updated a couple days ago when my phone updated with this one ui 5 update.

i couldn't give two shits about the customization. they removed the feature to have pop up notifications on apps you turn to silent for some godawful reason.

before, i was able to have my apps on silent, but allow the little pop up notification thingy show up still. honestly it was kind of annoying and janky, but it let me know someone was trying to message me.

but now i'm unable to turn on the pop up notification when the app is on silent. i feel targeted because i'm a weird person who doesn't want sound, but wants blatantly see a notification when my phone is in my hand.

i thought i was getting away from bullshit updates that changes how your phone works and you're just supposed to get used to it because the company has some shitty vision for their products."
"s23ultra - best phone i ve ever usef hi

seriously this phone is truly the best i have used in my whole life in every aspect 

i am talking about the s23u but to be honest i am pretty sure this is the case for the whole s23 series

the phone is made of amazing materials (already the case in the s22 series), feeling in hand is amazing...

oneui as always amazing in every aspect + the apps we can download like goodlock which add a lot 

amazing performances, i have been using the phone for 11 days now, not a single lag, not a single stutter, nothing 
it is buttery smooth

the display is magnificent, so amazing to use even under the sun with no clouds at all

samsung's ecosystem truly amazing with the watch, the buds, does not have one but with their tablets or their computers (and the integration with windows os)

the spen is pretty cool too, but not something i am using really (but still working very very very well, gestures are cool and i'm sure some people love it)

photo and videos quality... amazing
and i m saying that knowing they will still improve some aspects, which can be improved (like telephoto video quality which is still better on s22)

and the battery....

seriously this is unbelievable for an android phone
just look at the screens, it is a mix of outside/ inside / wifi / lte....

pre order s23u [cancelled] to fold 4 crazy story without all the blah blah blah details.  i was ready to move from the fold 4 to s23 u and take a beating on the trade in.  i pre ordered s23u and waiting and waiting for shipping info that never comes.  i look in my account and they move the date from 2/17 to 3/10 and i was like wth.  i chat them and ask them can i cancel that order and reorder with pickup at bestbuy 2/17 which the site says i could.  i am like no biggie cool getting my s23u on 2/17 weee fun!  he cancels the first order and proceeds to order the new subsequent order and says where are we shipping to.  i am like wth i want to pickup at bb.  he says sorry not an option.  done done done!  i guess the fold 4 chose me since i chose it anyway!  saved $500 loss on trade in any way.

a) base the routine on network connections,  so i have to keep wi-fi on all the time;

fix/solution: make sure you're not going to change lock screen wallpaper anytime soon. even if you want to change, uninstall updates of the app in app info and then apply your desired lock screen wallpaper. then again you can install this one ui 5.1/5.0 featured app.

"note 20 ultra, 10 plus or s21 ultra currently i'm looking for a backup device. i have a z fold 4 rn, but i don't think it's gonna hold up honestly and i do love the phone, but i want to be on the safe side ofc. so i can't decide if the note 20, 10 plus or s21 ultra is worth it today especially with the s23 coming out this week. i just want to pick up a backup phone that's great for the price, still a beast of a phone and something i can switch from  time to time. they all have they pros and cons, but ultimately one has to be better."

why did samsung put a hold on delivery of the s23? i could have gotten the s23 five days ago because it has arrived to my local fedex store but fedex is saying it's on hold until the 15th. meanwhile everyone else has already gotten theirs.
has anyone in the usa gotten their s23s yet? i see a lot in other countries did. do they have the whole usa waiting until the 17th?

"galaxy -> iphone -> galaxy i switched from iphone 13 pro which i have been using for nearly a year, before that i was using samsung. i tend to upgrade every year and last year an employee customer service yelled me so i made the decision, to switch to iphone.   


iphones are great, they just work. my experience with the iphone 13 pro was excellent. it is smooth, no hiccups are being noticed in everyday us, the camera was ok, but not as good as my previous galaxy s21 ultra. but everything is good at some particular point. especially i was amazed by how the app is optimized for the phone, the ui is polished. the build quality is 10 out of 10. i could not find a thing that i didn't like about the design, the battery is all day.

&#x200b;

now i'm switching back to samsung because i like to mess with the settings and the features of the phone, mainly with the cameras, iphones are nice at the point when you just want to use your phone normally, just pick up and use it, that's it. so it is a kind of boring phone. galaxy has multiple features which benefit everyday use. i really miss the galaxy, i'm not a samsung fan but i will choose anything that would fit my needs, and that is the galaxy, despite being treated like shit by the customer service in viet nam. 

both iphone and androids (specifically samsung) are great. they have their own pros and cons."
"s23 ultra display is strong and durable the s23 ultra is super strong. i had my s23 ultra on my lap while sitting and it accidentally slip off, landed directly on the screen on hardwood floor and there no damage done at all. absolute 0 damage. i had no phone case and no screen protector. i'm definitely sticking to samsung for a while now. height it fell from is approximately 60-70 cm."

"proper quality cases hi guys,

&#x200b;

what are some brands like pitaka for example or phonerebel (for iphone) that are specialized in cases and you can be sure that when you buy something you'll get quality.

&#x200b;

i recently bought my first iphone 14 pro max for which i got a case from phonerebel and i gotta say, it's out of this world. 

&#x200b;

problem is that for my s23 ultra phonerebel don't make cases, so i am not sure on what to get.

&#x200b;

basically i would like a case that is magsafe compatible (yes, for the s23, like it or not magsafe is absolutely amazing, so why wouldn't i benefit from this on android as well) and also if possible to offer 360 protection, [like this one](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/h0a023872e7a2475cb992823694aca9a51/magnetic-case-for-samsung-galaxy-s22-s23-note-20-ultra-s21-plus-s20-fe-a53-a13.jpg), but to be of good build quality.   


what are such brands i can investigate? i'm in europe but it doesn't matter where the brands are from.

&#x200b;

thanks."
"longtime apple user, swapped to the s23u as the title says, i'm a longtime apple user who just got the s23u in today! have had an apple device since the original ipod shuffle. 

i have been very pleasantly surprised with how easy swapping from apple to android has been. samsung has made it incredibly easy to swap over. on my iphone 12 pro max, which i love, it has 38,000 pics and videos, totaling up to 170gb of data on icloud. i set the samsung to download through icloud and it downloaded everything today. all 170gb. all photos and videos are here, edits and meta data has been preserved, even favorites are in the favorites folders, albums show up too! though icloud shared folders did not show up. i'd recommend making a local copy of those. contacts, notes, and files transfered over too. 

samsung made it very easy and i'm happy. 

phone seems snappy, has a good camera and is otherwise good. still a bit of a learning curve changing over but pretty straightforward. obviously i can't make a recommendation based off less than a day of use, but i an impressed with current first impressions."
"feeling a little home sick.- any other iphone switchers here? i have been with iphone since 2007 and i have upgraded every single year, i love the iphone. though for this year i have decided to 'jump ship' as it were and give myself a 1-year trial of samsung to see if i can make the switch it. i bought the s23 ultra, and i love it. so many things i love about it, the customisation, the speed, the camera the beauty of that display.. the whole package really. 

but, inevitably, i am feeling a little home sick and would love to hear others experiences from switching from the iphone recently, how are you guys finding it? : )"
"s23 ultra banding issues with video i have an s23 ultra and i get weird banding when filming in my room. it's the kind you seee when the frequency of your lights is out of sync with your shutter speed/framerate.

i have the phillips hue lights but it didn't bug my s21 ultra or my fold 4. or my wife's iphone 13 pro. or any other phone i've ever used in here... like... what?

when i drop shutter speed in pro mode to 1/50 or 1/90 then it goes away but that's not a proper solution in my opinion. this just shouldn't be happening.

anyone else experiencing this?"

"tab lock screen rotation bug fixed. there's been a pretty annoying bug for tabs where if you set it up using smart switch lock screen rotation is just broken.
welp, i figured out in part by accident that the toggle doesn't actually change the lock screen rotation setting. 
here is how to fix it.

download the most recent version of set edit open source from here [set edit open source ](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.github.muntashirakon.setedit/)

install the apk, if you haven't done so before you'll have to go into settings and allow install unknown apps, it should prompt you upon trying to install. perfectly fine it's just google being cautious/scare-mongering. it also might pester you before download it's all fine 

open the app, give it permissions, it'll tell you it's built for an older version just click okay.

in the system table, the setting is lock_screen_allow_rotation so find it and switch it from 0 to 1, save and you're done, you can delete that app now if you want.

no more factory reset needed and you can use smart switch!"

"are there 3rd party app devs that optimize samsung features? samsung has a lot of features that are unused and simply not optimized with many apps.

as a nintendo gamer, nintendo also has this issue where 3rd party companies tend to not optimize it's features for their games. however 1 way that they get around this issue is by hiring a 3rd party dev like panic button to optimize a game like doom to the switch.

are there 3rd party app developers that do something similar? take on the optimization for google or microsoft to implement the features for them so they don't have to?

this way the 1st party devs can focus on regular phones and the 3rd party dev can figure out how to make office apps function better in the z fold or dex or both.

just a thought."
"s23u is awesome i got my s23u from fedex today. set up everything fresh, only transfer message and photos. this is the first phone from samsung that do not get hot when first start up (and i used like so many samsung phone before, they all get hot after setting up apps).  


so far so good. phone is really comfortable to hold due to the straight edge. i already put the s-view case on it so no need to worry about screen getting scratch from getting in and out of my pants."
