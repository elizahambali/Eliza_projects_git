What is the point of smart lists in the reminders app,356,11ihovf,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11ihovf/what_is_the_point_of_smart_lists_in_the_reminders/,80,"Am I the only one who has no idea why apple borked so much of the functionality of a list when using smart lists????? No sub-tasks for tasks in smart list, what?! why?!. Can't share a smart list??? WHAT?! WHY?! Can't move a task from a normal list to a smart list so that it only shows up there and doesn't repeat in two lists???? WHAT?! WHY?! Cant make a smart list your default list???? WHAT?! WHY?! What is the point of smart lists? Why would I use one vs a normal list? I thought that I might be able to create an inbox list that I could dump new reminders into to be processed later (ie. add tags to the reminders) so that they would flow out of the inbox and to the respective smart list. This way I could achieve a 0 inbox simply by adding tags and leveraging smart lists. Nope this is not how they work. As far as I can tell smart lists are 100% useless. Does anyone have a compelling use case to use these, honestly dumb, smart lists?",1677974701.0

Expense - app for tracking expenses,21,11item9,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11item9/expense_app_for_tracking_expenses/,21,"App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expense-control-your-budget/id1669548999?platform=iphone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expense-control-your-budget/id1669548999?platform=iphone)  
Hi, recently I released my new app - Expense, it is a simply designed app that helps to track your expenses and remain within your budget boundaries.

The basic idea is that you create a budget and set a specific amount of money you want to spend per month. As you add expenses, the total amount will decrease, and you will be able to track three main values: your monthly budget, the amount you've spent, and the remaining balance for the current month. The values reset at the beginning of each new month (week/day, based on the selected time range), but the history of the previous time ranges is available.

The app also allows you to switch between different time ranges, such as week or day, by dividing your monthly budget by the number of weeks or days in that period. This feature allows you to see the same data, but for a shorter time frame, helping you understand if you're staying within your weekly or daily budget, which in turn helps you avoid exceeding your monthly budget in the future.

To make things more visual, the app provides charts that make it easier to identify trends and patterns in your spending habits and helps you make more informed decisions about your budget going forward.

Also, a few main advantages over other similar apps:  
\- easy to use / simple UI- data is synchronized on all your devices  
\- the ability to share and manage your budget with other people  
\- recurring expenses, you can add repeating payments  


Would like to hear your feedback, thank you :)",1678010447.0

Who Said That? - Ask your friends questions and try to guess whose answer is whose... and also who's a robot!,3,11ixaa6,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11ixaa6/who_said_that_ask_your_friends_questions_and_try/,0,"Hello, 

I've spent the last couple of years making my first app called Who Said That?. It is a mobile game to play with your friends where you ask each other questions, receive the answers anonymously then try to figure out whose answer is whose. 

It's a game of double bluffs and second-guessing as you trick your friends into thinking your answer is someone else's. There are also bonus points for the best answer so you want to write something good!

In addition, you can add Alan BOT to your games, an AI player that uses the latest ChatGPT API to answer your questions and give an answer. Will Alan fool you into thinking he's one of your friends or even swipe the bonus points for the best answer? 

Finally, there's also a single-player mode where you can choose an answer to ask Alan and see if you can guess which answer is his and which is from a real human. 

It's free to play so hopefully you'll love to try it and give any feedback at all.

Create New iCloud Email address and Update Apple ID to use it,85,11ho854,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11ho854/create_new_icloud_email_address_and_update_apple/,42,"Hello,

I cant get a straight answer to this question and I've spent hours trying to research online. I've had my current apple ID (which is an @ [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) email address) for over a decade.

What I cant seem to confirm is if I sign into [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) and click on the top left ""Apple ID"" tile to change my apple ID:

1. Will I be able to enter the new [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) email address I want created?
2. If so, and I proceed with changing my apple id will the original email still be available and linked to the account so that I have time to switch over to it?

"Stolen MacBook delivery, filed a police report but Apples says I’m on my own",265,11g7ryb,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11g7ryb/stolen_macbook_delivery_filed_a_police_report_but/,283,"**”Good” news: see bottom**

I ordered a MacBook Pro this Monday and I expected the delivery to arrive on Wednesday. Indeed the MacBook was _listed_ as delivered by both Apple and FedEx (the courier) but it never arrived at my apartment. Looking at the FedEx proof of delivery, it turned out that **it was signed for by a complete stranger** with no affiliation with myself or the apartment!

So I contacted both Apple and FedEx, and at Apple’s recommendation I filed a police report with the Baltimore Police Department. I called Apple again this morning in order to update them that I filed the report, and I was prepared them to give them the case number, but they said it was BPD that had to inform Apple, not me.

So then I called BPD asking if they’d inform Apple, and they said no, and I will have to forward the police report to Apple myself. I then called Apple _again_ and this time they said it was completely out of their hands, and that it was now the responsibility of local law enforcement to resolve the case. But knowing BPD…yeah good luck with that.

So now I'm $2000 in the hole and at this point the only thing I can think of that'll get me back that money is to call my credit card company to do a chargeback (or at least call Apple again to threaten one). I've seen that that's a way to get your Apple ID locked, but if that's the way a trillion-dollar corporation is willing to do with regards to their deliveries, perhaps it is worth it to be excommunicated from the walled garden.

I hope that this post highlights these sorts of issues with Apple, given that I am not the only person who has faced them (just search up ""stolen deliveries"" on this sub or on other Apple forums).

**Update (3/3/2023)**

The leasing office updated me about what they saw on the surveillance footage. At the time of the supposed delivery, there was no delivery personnel (FedEx or otherwise) going through the entrance.

I called FedEx in order to update my case with this information, as well as provide them with my leasing offices’ contact information. I also called BPD in order to let the office submit the footage as evidence in the police report.

**Update 2 (3/3/2023)**

The leasing office contacted me again a few hours after the previous update saying that a shipment to my name had arrived. And indeed, it was my MacBook - the tracking number and the serial number matched up, and the laptop had arrived in working condition. ~~I’ll still have to update FedEx and BPD about this resolution.~~ Updated both of them to close their cases.

That said, **this whole experience remains completely unacceptable.** Most egregiously, FedEx should not have let a complete rando sign on my behalf, then mark the package as delivered when it wouldn’t actually arrive for another two days. And Apple should not have been so hostile to the customer when the delivery of their item has failed.

Ultimately I expected a far better experience from a company that markets itself as a premium brand, and I had to waste two and a half days dealing with and worrying about delivery shenanigans and potentially having to initiate  chargebacks or legal action. Plus it’s not my own time that was wasted - I’m sure the leasing office, the BPD officers working on my case, and my friends who were helping me all had better things to do.

For present and future Apple customers, unless you have no other options (e.g. you live in a remote area), **do not consider Apple delivery.** Other Redditors have stated this advice in the comments below, and now I will join them in repeating it.",1677776390.0

Apple Should Support iCloud Drive Backups to Time Machine,296,11g2dsu,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11g2dsu/apple_should_support_icloud_drive_backups_to_time/,68,"BLUF/TLDR: Apple should make Time Machine capable of keeping local backups of data that has been offloaded from your device due to iCloud Drive's Optimize Storage option.

Apple has Time Machine to support local backups.

Apple offers Optimize Storage with iCloud Drive for those who have limited local hard drive space.

Unfortunately, any files MacOS decides to not keep locally due to Optimize Storage will also not get backed up to Time Machine nor other backup solutions that I'm aware of thus reducing those files offloaded to iCloud in a ""one copy state"" and at risk of data loss that can be caused by a multitude of things including user error.  Also changes made to those files on other devices will never make it to Time Machine unless you access that file on the Mac connected to Time Machine causing MacOS to download the file again.

I understand there are folks who have data caps and can not spare the possible excessive data movement which could be caused by such a system but I'd love to see Apple offer an option to get around this.

Just give us an option, along with a warning that the feature could cause excessive data usage, where Time Machine can temporarily download a file from iCloud Drive to back it up then remove the temp file.  It would only need to do this once for the most part as any files you are actively changing after that point would be downloaded anyway.  For files modified on other devices iCloud could use a Modified tag just like local incremental backups use so Time Machine could grab the most recent update for backup.

I dunno, I know this is full on TLDR material for a lot of folks but I'd love if I could get more people to think about this and maybe the community can start giving some pressure that Apple could eventually respond to.  I'm going to submit my suggestions to Apple but one dude ain't going to change the flow of Apples development.",1677762560.0

Dont trust iCloud with your Data! (lost many files),147,11ex473,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11ex473/dont_trust_icloud_with_your_data_lost_many_files/,284,"First of all I know that its kinda my fault for storing all of my documents only in iCloud but I somehow trusted Apple to keep my data safe after an old harddrive broke and I didn't wanna get my own nas system.

Two days ago I realized that almost 900Gigabytes of my Data in iCloud was just gone.   
All Folders were still there, only the files in the folders were missing.

I immediately  looked into my ""recently deleted"" folder in iCloud but there were no file in there.

Since I didn't know when or how my files were removed from my iCloud (which only I have access to) I contacted Apples support.

The Apple support told me to go to [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) and try the ""Data Recovery"" thing on the bottom of the site.

The ""Restore Files"" thing on [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) found 5000 deleted files that were to be permanently deleted in 2 days. So i instantly got to restoring those files. The website wasnt made to restore many files at once tho, so i had to restore them in packs of around 100files.   
Every time I reloaded the website the counter went back up to 5000 since there were much more than 5000 deleted files on my account.

After 2 days of almost continuous file restoration i was finally done...  
But most of my files, especially the important ones were still missing...

The (very nice) person from the apple support created a high priority ticket for the technicians in America to look at my case and get my files back.

Sadly the support rep called me a few minutes ago with the information that the techs finished the restoration... which by itself would be great news if not almost all of my files were still missing.

&#x200B;

So to sum it all up, I was stupid and trusted Apple that iCloud is a safe place to keep my data and now have lost more than 900gigs of photos, memories, documents and have no way of recovering them. (state registration card, purchase contract of my car,  rental contract of my flat, childhood photos, photos/memories of deceased relatives, all of my programming work from school, and so on)

So please always save your important files in multiple places and don't trust big companies to keep your data safe.

Lack of accountability at Apple,0,11gqvi2,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11gqvi2/lack_of_accountability_at_apple/,22,"I'm massively annoyed by the lack of accountability. After an in-app purchase didn't work, the vendor recommended that I'd get in touch with Apple for a refund. Despite providing evidence of the vendor themself asking me to do it, Apple refused the refund. I appealed, same result.

You’re not getting a reason as to why they refuse the refund. You also don’t get to state your case. It’s complete bs.

I contacted my bank, who had their legal department review the case. They concluded that I was entitled to a chargeback. They then contacted my card provider, who again had their legal department review the case and conclude that Apple was wrong in withholding the refund. 

Apple then blocked my app store account without telling me, resulting in me not being able to update apps and close security vulnerabilities. After I got in touch with Apple support, they re-enabled my account.

My card, however, remains blocked; I can’t use it anymore in the App Store or with Apple Pay. Apple support isn't interested in the case. When I raise this issue in the community the posts get removed.


My learnings from this case:

1.	Avoid Apple in-app purchases wherever possible because Apple doesn't like accountability
2.	Use a throw-away card that I don't use anywhere else on Apple so that it quickly can be replaced.",1677816751.0

It was honestly a nice reminder to never take anything or anyone for granted, and to cherish both the little and big things in life because they could easily disappear in the blink of an eye.

What could Apple do differently for iCloud password resets,1,11dydtq,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11dydtq/what_could_apple_do_differently_for_icloud/,83,"There's been many recent conversations about the impact of a thief taking your phone and knowing your unlock passcode (either through shoulder surfing or forcing you to divulge it).  Apple needs to find a very difficult balance between: 
1.	Your data being kept safe from other people 
2.	You being able to get your data back even if you stuff up by forgetting or losing something 
3.	Respecting privacy and trust expectations, particularly with end to end encrypted data 
4.	Doing the above for the majority of the population that is technically incompetant, forgetful, often doesn’t read or follow basic instructions, and doesn’t plan ahead... 
  
Even with Apple’s current implementation we see many more people losing access due to forgotten passwords or broken/lost devices or out of date recovery info etc, vs the kind of theft being addressed here.  Forcing users to know the current password before changing it can’t be implemented without also removing the other password reset methods that trust the same device (eg. pushed 6 digit 2FA codes).  The net impact would be to significantly increase the number of people losing their data or at least being very unhappy at the delays of Account Recovery. 
  
While the obvious best move is for users to use longer alphanumeric passcodes and/or be careful who is looking when entering the passcode, most people won’t do this and the real world is messy (see #4 above).  I know, I know, personal responsibility and all that but it is what it is. 
  
Some PROACTIVE steps Apple COULD take, however are:
1.	More user education & warnings (eg. a “Security checkup” notification in Settings every 12 months - remind user about the passcode’s critical importance, check&update trusted numbers, recommend using Recovery Contacts, re-enter the Recovery Key to see if you’ve lost it etc) 
2.	When resetting the iCloud password or changing 2FA settings - *IF* a 28 digit Recovery Key is already set, require EITHER the current icloud password OR the Recovery Key to be supplied.  This enhances security for users who have decided to enable the recovery key, but some other people are going to lose their accounts by accident because they lost their recovery key and password... 
3.	[terrible idea] Add an optional separate passcode for the keychain.  This will lead to some people losing their keychains the same way people lose password protected notes and complain about it despite the warnings they’re given.  The extra passcode can also be extracted from you at gunpoint.  I hate this idea a lot - IMO its better to let people choose to add a separate password manager if they want, and remember this information can still be extracted from you by force - there is no way to avoid this. 
4.	[terrible idea] Add a “This device is trusted” setting. Disabling this blocks the device from changing iCloud security settings and receiving pushed 6 digit 2FA codes, or iCloud SMS 2FA codes being sent to it.  It can only be re-enabled via a different device logged into the same account, or with the Recovery Key.  I hate this idea too, its a nightmare. 
  
And some REACTIVE (post-theft) steps Apple COULD take are:  

5.	 Allow the Account Recovery process even if a Recovery Key is set, IF the recovery key was created in the last 1-2 weeks  
6.	Allow old (reset) Recovery Keys to be used for 1-2 weeks  
7.	Allow password resets via deleted Recovery Contacts, IF they were deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
8.	Allow use of an old trusted phone number for password reset or Account Recovery, IF it was deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
9.	For arbitration of 6/7/8, successful use of an old item invalidates newer items of the same type",1677563629.0

I'm a doctor and just released my first app – a responsive mindful breathing app for stress & anxiety,92,11c8xf6,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11c8xf6/im_a_doctor_and_just_released_my_first_app_a/,31,"Website: https://www.lungy.app
App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/lungy-breathing-exercises/id1545223887

Hey guys!

Lungy is an iOS app that responds to breathing in real time, transforming your breath into a playful, interactive experience. I started working on it in 2020 during the first UK lockdown as a way to make breathing exercises much more fun and engaging. It's initially a wellness app, but hopefully at some point it can be developed into a platform for people with breathing problems (asthma, COPD and long COVID). I think it really makes the most of iPhone hardware (it should run on iPhone 6S+), with real-time cloth, fluid and rigid body sims all running on the GPU. You can also even create your own music using a synth and sequencer (go to Settings/Create Music).

There are obviously lots of breathing and meditation apps out there, I wanted Lungy to be different - it's about tuning into your surroundings and noticing the world around you, so all the visuals are nature-inspired or have some reference to the physical world. I didn’t like other apps required large downloads and/or a wifi connection, so Lungy’s download size is very small (<50MB), with no geometry, video or audio files.

Ecosystem question from an oblivious ex-user,0,11bxoml,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11bxoml/ecosystem_question_from_an_oblivious_exuser/,49,"Hi,
I see so many YouTubers that just keep on saying the same thing over and over, that ""Apple devices just communicate well with each other"". I used to have some Apple devices back then, but I definitely did not see any ecosystem magic happening. My parents have the latest iPhones, Apple watches, Apple TVs but they apparently don't see anything either. But that may be because they aren't searching for it.
These days I myself am a Pixel user. The Pixel also has an ecosystem and I would like to find out how the Apple one is to compare, since I heard it's better.

So I decided to go here to ask for some nice examples of Apple devices working well together.

Update:
Thanks for educating me. Just to summarize what I learned, I decided to create a sort of ""Venn Diagram"" in text.

Apple only: using iPad as second screen, handoff (clipboard, files), stats from watch on AppleTV screen, using phone as webcam (although this is coming in Android 14), AirDrop with PC, signing phone documents on PC

Both: Headphone audio-switching, controlling TV, Find My, Synced texts between PC, phone and watch, ""AirDrop"" (in quotes because it's called Nearby Share on Android), Cloud sync, Password manager integrated into OS, Photos app syncing between devices, unlocking device with another device, AirPlay (Chromecast on Android), home devices automation (turning off TV when you're not home for example) - this last one requires set-up, continuing websites from computer on phone or vice versa, scanning documents to PC, transferring calls to other devices easily, starting maps on watch when phone navigation starts and vice versa

Google only: Headphone audio-switching on Windows, Synced texts on Windows, Touching 2 devices to wirelessly transfer files, being able to open Android apps on Windows and them syncing with your phone apps, USB tethering (extremely underrated, low-key amazing)

I think I put everything you guys mentioned in here. Thanks for clarifying, from what it seems, the gap isn't really big.

My hate-love relationship with the HomePod as a music enthusiast,38,11ar6ro,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11ar6ro/my_hatelove_relationship_with_the_homepod_as_a/,26,"I hadn’t paid much attention to the HomePod since the initial release because it was limited to be an Apple Music streaming box. I started looking into it when I heard about the new release. But more importantly, the possibility of using a pair as a stereo AirPlay device in macOS.

It had been a while since I was looking for the perfect transportable audio setup, as I am always on the go. I like neutral sound; at home, I have KEF LS50 speakers with a NuPrime amp and the go Campfire Ara IEMs with a Dragonfly DAC/amp. Finding a good comprise that would allow good sound and the possibility of being transported in a suitcase by plane was challenging. I had been thinking of going with an Apollo Twin and small bookshelves from either PreSonus or Neumann. But it was still a lot of weight, and the setup would not go very low.

I went to the Apple Store for a listening session, but unfortunately, laying HomePods on a table 50 cm below the ears with ambient noise does not do the trick. I ended up coming back home with two.

After setting them up as pair and selecting the output in macOS, I opened the Audio Midi Setup to check the bitrate and depth. I was pretty sure I heard AirPlay2 was bringing lossless, but there are some nuances ([Apple AirPlay 2 supports 24-bit lossless audio, but you can’t use it | digitaltrends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/apple-homepod-24-bit-lossless-audio-airplay-2/)), and we are stuck at 16bit 44.1kHz. Figure out the logic behind being in the ecosystem (streaming from a MacBook or an iPhone) but still being software lock to the lowest quality. Cherry on the cake is bye-bye streaming the ALAC library, their own lossless codec.

Sound-wise, I admit it’s impressive! They sound way bigger than they are,  the soundstage is excellent. The high feels pretty bright, and the mids are clear. But when it comes to the base, although they are well-defined, they are way too pushed. I check the setting in the Home app to discover that there is an option to reduce bass. It sounds way better; it leaves room for the rest, but it feels like a straight cut below 70Hz. So we are stuck between choosing overkilled lows or no bass; it feels incomprehensible, given the potential of the hardware.

Even with these unpleasant surprises, I will keep the pair of HomePod because it corresponds best to my use case. It’s an unbeatable form factor for the sound, the DSP is great, and the setup is frictionless. It would not take that much to make the HomePod appealing to a broader audience with a software update that:

* Allow lossless streaming via AirPlay from any Apple device
* Add an EQ setting for the HomePod in Home app",1677244676.0

Thank you for providing the previous version of the iCloud terms and conditions. I have compared it to the current version and here are the key changes that I have identified:

* Section 1 (Terms and Conditions) has been updated to clarify that the agreement governs your use of iCloud and any related Apple services, products, and software.
* The previous version of Section 2 (Your Account) included a subsection on the use of Touch ID and Face ID to access iCloud. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your Apple ID.
* Section 3 (Use of iCloud) has been updated to include a subsection on iCloud Backup, which allows you to backup and restore data from your iOS or iPadOS devices.
* The previous version of Section 4 (iCloud Services) included a subsection on iCloud Keychain. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead includes a subsection on ""iCloud Private Relay,"" a new feature designed to enhance the privacy and security of your internet activity.
* Section 6 (User Content) has been updated to include a subsection on Live Photos, which allows you to share animated photos with others through iCloud.
* Section 10 (Apple's Intellectual Property) has been updated to clarify that Apple may use feedback you provide about iCloud to improve the service.
* The previous version of Section 11 (Indemnification) included a subsection on the use of Touch ID and Face ID to access iCloud. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your Apple ID.
* Section 12 (Dispute Resolution) has been updated to include a subsection on class action waivers, which prohibit you from bringing claims against Apple as part of a class action or consolidated action.

These are the key changes that I have identified between the previous version and the current version of the iCloud terms and conditions. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other changes that I did not identify or that are less significant.**

Later Edit:  **As embarassing as this is, I'm going to leave this up instead of deleting it. But I've learned a valuable lesson in AI being ""confidently incorrect"" or better more accurately, bullshit it pulled out of its ass.    I would have expected this to be a start to understand the terms better but in manually comparing them, there's not even the words ""biometric"" anywhere in the new terms nor ""face id"" and ""touch id"" in the old terms, to pick a simple but glaring example.**",1677246322.0

Like, if someone’s trying to steal a car that costs tens of thousands of dollars or something, a pair of AirPods Pro’s seems like a small investment, which they’d also get back if the car was stolen, or, if someone is obsessed enough with a person, they could just use AirPods to track them. Yes, it’s not nearly as discrete as an AirTag, but it’s still not that difficult to hide if you try, especially in a car. The battery won’t last that long, but I’d still be creepy.

Announcing Notifications,19,11ack7m,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11ack7m/announcing_notifications/,6,"Has anyone had any success getting their iPad or Apple Watch to announce notifications out loud?

I’ve been experimenting with this Announce Notifications. On my iPhone 14, I successfully got it to start announcing notifications from some of my most important applications. I went through the process of toggling on Announce Notifications, selecting those apps that I want it to announce notifications from, and then toggling on Announce Notifications on Speaker.

I followed the same process on my iPad Mini 5. Yet despite me toggling on the same buttons, etc. that I did on my iPhone, my iPad Mini doesn’t announce the notifications. Again, this is weird because I did the same thing on my iPad Mini, that I did on my iPhone, which now successfully announces the notifications I want it to.

Also, I toggled on the Announce Notifications button on my Apple Watch, and selected the apps I wanted it to do so for. But yet, my Apple Watch is not announcing the notifications.

Am I missing something here? Some steps? Any insight into why my iPhone successfully announces notifications but my iPad and Apple Watch won’t?

Thanks!",1677195853.0

Nothing has changed with my voice, though I did buy an upgraded iPhone.  But what has coincided with updates over the last two years is that its voice to text got a lot worse - then, very recently, it became garbage tier.

It's little wonder why I see so many drivers texting now - we can't rely on the phone to not make the other party pissed off.  But it isn't merely while commuting - it's also in the calm work environment.

And what's with it constantly trying to leave a space between the period at the end of sentences?  What's with commas placed in nonsensical places?  I'd much rather it skip trying to punctuate my voice than punctuating it badly.",1677158811.0

I haven't had any issues losing any gadgets in a long while (knock on wood!), so in early January when I was traveling for work and staying in a friend's apartment while he was away it was disappointing when I couldn't find my AirPods. ""Find My"" had listed them at my location a mere 45 minutes earlier, but they were nowhere to be seen. I figured my streak had come to an end and I went out a few days later to replace them (they never popped back up on the map and I had them okay a sound and never heard anything).

Skip ahead to 6-7 weeks later and I had just arrived back at my friend's apartment for another work trip. I always pay for a professional cleaning after I stay there and I walked in to find two earbuds sitting on the counter near the washing machine... ! I felt a pit in my stomach and searched the washing machine for the case and eventually found it in the dryer, sticking to the ceiling. *The AirPods had been washed and dried. * 

I reached in and, trying to look on the bright side (they weren't lost, after all), collected the case. I opened it up to take a look and was shocked to see the light go on... And then my phone vibrated and let me know that my AirPods had been located! Could it be, could they be functional? I put the earbuds into the case and plugged it in to charge. 

Thirty minutes later came the moment of truth--I unplugged them and put them into my ears. The familiar tone sounded and my phone connected to them! And then, I went to Apple Music and ... They sounded perfectly normal! After having been lost for over a month, during which time they were fully laundered, it was as if nothing ever happened!

Maybe I shouldn't be impressed... But I am. To go through that sort of ordeal and still work perfectly well could easily be luck (and it probably is!), but it still shows a level of quality and reliability that I don't readily associate with other brands or products.

Anyway, I don't know why anyone should care about this trivial story, but I thought I'd share so my positive experience is noted and in case it helps anyone to hear it.",1677136620.0

It sucks that Apple Pay Cash and Apple Card not in Europe,111,117fp86,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/117fp86/it_sucks_that_apple_pay_cash_and_apple_card_not/,95,"With many online fintech companies in Europe that support Apple Pay, big banks like HSBC, and Credit Suisse. It remains still a mystery that Pay Cash at least isn’t available here. 

I would close most of my online bank accounts if I could just use Pay Cash. I understand that the Apple Card cannot come here as we are less keen to get credit cards and there are rarely any here plus the higher regulations they’d have to deal with.

I haven’t seen any articles or YouTubers talking about this, perhaps I am part of a particular bubble that just doesn’t seem to find this useful. I know that apple stock camera, the measure app and some accessibility functions make use of it. However more interested whether some applications that really depends on it, it’s a bit strange that such feature is made so mainstream but I don’t see any pone talking about it.

Update so far:
Beside what I mentioned the apple stock app above (camera, measure and accessibility), apparently used for

-	 extensive and maybe daily use by people that need to measure 3D objects
-	dimensions of an interior (floor plans, house or even caves). Mainly personal use, but also business use
-	medical profession to scan body part
-	drone scanning of grounds

Apple's Standard Warranty Surprise,0,118hp08,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/118hp08/apples_standard_warranty_surprise/,8,"I purchased a 5th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro in November. Apple's standard warranty expires in August '23 for this unit. It was sold to me as excellent condition, which it was when I received it. It was much brighter than the 4th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro that I also have. I purchased a 6th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro recently. All purchased used, 'Open Box' on eBay. 

As I was synchronizing the settings of the 6th GEN side-by-side with the 4th and 5th GEN units, I noticed that the 5th GEN was much brighter than the other two. Now I realized that on the 5th GEN *True Tone,* a feature of these iPads, wasn't activated yet. But it was! That's when I realized it wasn't functioning! I called Apple and the result was that it needed a repair that was covered under the standard 12 month hardware warranty. So I sent it in to Apple.

I was just informed by Apple that the repair could not be made because there was another problem with the device. The USB plug receptacle was damaged and that it needed to be replaced. That type of damage is not covered under the standard warranty. My choices were to not have the repairs done, or to let Apple keep and recycle the unit or, cough, pay $799 for the repair.🤮

I used that unit daily since November. I experienced no problem with the USB plug receptacle. Yet here I am. This is not a complaint. My days of complaining are over. I will accept the unit back of course. I'm curious to see what, if any, difference there is with the USB plug receptacle when I receive it back! If it is returned as I sent it in, I can do without *True Tone.* When the 7th GEN iPad 12.9 is released, I'll get that one too.

I always get AppleCare+ but the unit needs to be within the time frame that one would qualify to purchase AppleCare+. This unit was beyond that time period.

Warranties of any kind, from any company, are not black or white. They are gray. In this matter, for me, it is insignificant. But for a hard-working young person who struggles to get along in life, I believe this would be a big disappointment.

Even though I'm usually an android user, I always tried out some apple products, including iPhones (I'm a tech fan, I do not stick to only one company) 

But the early iPhones always kissed my eyes tbh. 

I'm currently rocking an iPhone SE (22) next to a P6P, and I may stick to the iPhone for a longer period. 

I LOVE the Design with homebutton. It feels and looks so timeless and elegant. 

My biggest wish would be that apple keeps doing the SE lineup in this design or even add one in the Plus-Size like the 8 plus. Maybe put an OLED in it, but I'm fine with the IPS retina as well. 

I love that you can hold this phone without being on the screen instantly, I don't know what it is, but I prefer this sleek look with a square display over the modern, almost bezel-less designs.

beware ordering same day delivery,514,11655bs,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11655bs/beware_ordering_same_day_delivery/,133,"I ordered a new macbook pro for my company. It was to be delivered to my house by postmates/uber within a few hours. I received a text saying get ready for your delivery. Then a text saying your delivery is arriving. A guy came to my door w/ an apple bag, showing my name and address and order #, and my new computer was taped into the bag. He asked me if my name was ? I said yes. He had me sign for the delivery. I took the bag and shut my door. I received a text saying my order was delivered. A few minutes later, he rang my door again. I don’t know why I answered. But I answered, and he said he had delivered to the wrong address and he must take my computer back from me, please hand it over. WTF? I said no, this is my computer, I paid for it, I signed for it, I have all the payment and delivery receipts. He kept insisting and implying that I was a thief. I got my husband involved. My husband tried showing the guy the bag proving this is the correct address and he needs to leave. The guy kept threatening saying he’s going to ask one more time then he will call the cops. I told him to call the cops then, and shut the door. 

He called the cops, I called the cops, they came, were super bored w/ the whole thing, it was clear the delivery guy was in the wrong, they showed him the actual bag he gave me that the computer was in, that listed my name and address and order#, proving he was at the right address. The cops said the guy then apologized to them and drove away. 

But I was left shaking and nerves a mess. So I called apple to let them know what happened w/ their delivery. The lady on the phone was horrified and apologetic, said that should never have happened, told me I did everything right disengaging and contacting police, that the guy handled it wrong. She said he is not law enforcement so if he thought he made a mistake he had no authority to go demand my computer back from me, he should have contacted apple and they would have easily and quickly confirmed that he delivered to the correct address.

"Just released a major update to Dime, a beautiful and intuitive personal finance tracker and budgeting tool. Now with income tracking, overall budgets, UI redesigns and more!",278,1166geu,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1166geu/just_released_a_major_update_to_dime_a_beautiful/,68,"Hey r/apple! Hope you’re having a great weekend.

TLDR: [Dime 2.0](https://apple.co/3ANcqCN) is here with income tracking, overall budgets, a UI makeover and more! It is a beautiful, intuitive expense tracker built with iOS design guidelines in mind. And, it's 100% free with no ads or paywalls.

Nearly half a year ago, I launched Dime 1.0 as a project to kickstart my programming journey, and was taken aback by the response. I am immensely grateful for all the comments, reviews, and feedback I have gotten ever since, majority of them being from this subreddit!

The most requested feature by far had got to be income tracking. I was initially rather reluctant to add this in as it would essentially require a complete overhaul and migration of existing data models and the UI built around them. Additionally, I felt it would diminish the simplicity of the app that many users had grown to love. Nonetheless, with the help of the 300 beta testers on TestFlight, I was able to experiment with different integrations of this new feature, and eventually landed on one I was really satisfied with.

Today, I’m proud to present Dime 2.0, its biggest update thus far. And of course, no changes to the pricing model - still a 100% free with no ads, paywalls, or data collection.

💥 What's New in V2.0!

-	The feature requested in almost every support email - income tracking.
-	Redesigned input interface that minimises excessive swiping if you have many categories.
-	Redesigned category list with category suggestions and the ability to reorder categories.
-	Rebuilt the Insights page to minimise lag and crashes.
-	Lock screen widgets for iOS 16.
-	Overall category-less budgets!.
-	Added interactive line graph to the Home page (turned off by default, can be accessed via Feature Lab in Settings).
-	Insight filtering configuration now persists between sessions i.e. if you configure your Insights page to show monthly statistics, it will stay that way from then on (and not revert to the default, which is weekly insights).
-	Added triangular indicators to the budget bar graphs which show the optimal spending percentage.
-	Option to have a more compact Budgets page by swapping the grid for rows.
-	Custom time frames (e.g. 3 days, 5 weeks, 7 months) for recurring transactions.
-	Swipe to delete transactions.

🥰 Why You’ll Love Dime

-	100% free forever, with no paywall or ads.
-	Beautifully iOS-centric design, with simplicity at its core.
-	Insightful expenditure breakdowns over various time periods.
-	Create budgets based on expense categories and stick to them.
-	Create recurring expenses with custom time frames.
-	Sync your expenses, categories and budgets with other devices via iCloud.
-	Custom reminders to input your expenses.
-	Biometric authentication to protect your data.
-	Home screen quick actions make capturing new expenses a breeze.
-	A gorgeous night theme for dark mode fanatics.
-	Informative home and lock screen widgets keep you updated at a glance.

I genuinely hope Dime will be able to help you cultivate prudent expenditure habits. Any feedback or thoughts is welcomed, and appreciated. Moreover, if you have found Dime to be useful, it would be incredibly helpful if you could give it a great review on the App Store. Am unable to afford marketing for a free app, so ratings and reviews are my best bet at spreading the word about it.

A special thanks to all those who have generously tipped the app, all proceeds will go towards my upcoming Apple Developer subscription cycle payment 😊

Have a great week ahead!

iOS 16.3 can delete data on your iPhone/iPad without asking - I've lost 2500+ books,37,116lmfa,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/116lmfa/ios_163_can_delete_data_on_your_iphoneipad/,8,"Hello,

In Feb iOS 16.3 has deleted all my 2500+ books from Apple Books on iPad. ePubs and articles in PDFs, which were sorted in many categories.

Probably, it has happened because my iPad's storage was full and iOS had decided to delete books instead of caches, offloading apps or deleting iCloud photos (which can be re-downloaded from the cloud).

Without informing the user, of course. iCloud wasn't enabled for Apple Books. No JB.

Here is the story:

I was browsing in the evening, when my iPad has turned off - the battery was empty. I've connected the charger and left it till the morning. In the morning iPad was up and running, I was using it as usual. Few hours later I've opened Apple Books and it was empty: no books, no covers, just empty collections. Checked iPad Storage tab - 50Gb free space (this space was occupied by Books) and Apple Books with 0MB for Documents.

Ok, going to logs - nothing unusual. Silence. Ok, I have a full iTunes backup, not the freshest one - 6 months old, but better than no backup at all.

I was able to get into my iPad to make as low-level examination as possible.

What I've checked:

    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases - empty, all books were deleted
    BKLibrary - empty, only categories
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases/Purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases/Backup-Purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Sync/Books.plist - some titles and filenames, but not all

I've identified when books were deleted - at 03:52:

    BKLibrary (recovered records):
    Table ZBKCOLLECTIONMEMBER
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;

Then I've spent almost 1,5 weeks digging in iOS internals and I was able to identify the key suspect - some sort of ""experiments"", which iOS executes on user devices:

database of AppleMediaServices was cleaned by iOS, so traces were hidden, but I was able to recover some data:

Bingo! Time is the same as in BKLibrary when records (and books!) were deleted.

So, iOS has silently deleted all books.

Later I have written a custom parser, which examined 2 600 000+ rows of raw data of some internal indexes, which iOS uses and it helped me to recover some info: titles and file names.

Still a long way to combine all findings for recovery.

Findings:

* iOS 16.3 can delete all books without asking
* iTunes Full Backup is not backing up sideloaded PDFs & ePubs in Apple Books
* When Apple Books app is backed up via iTunes, BKLibrary database is vacuumed, so no deleted data inside.
* No info is logged about deletion - but I'm checking for extra evidences
* Logs are clean: no suspicious activity
* There are no single place with metadata for Apple Books - I'm assembling info piece by piece from many places in iOS: databases, logs, activity data, thumbnails etc. 90% manual work.

I'll make a new post later, including all details related to my Apple Books forensics and recovery.

&#x200B;

P.S. Keep in mind that iOS can delete any data anytime - do manual backups. iCloud can fail as well - imagine losing years of private photos...",1676834931.0

Hi all, I thought it would be cool to use AI for something fun, so I made an [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jester-ai-caption-writer/id1661372840) that writes **Instagram captions for you using just an image**—including puns, jokes, and hashtags. It usually gets the captions right and I’ve been pretty astonished by how funny some of them can be.

How it works is you pick any photo (no sign-in required) Jester generates four unique captions. From there, you can choose your favorite and edit it as you wish. If you're not happy with any of the captions, click the retry button to generate four more. You can also add context, use the photo location, or generate more variants of any caption. When you're happy, you can copy the caption, share it, or post to Instagram.

Captioning 5 photos is free every day and there's a paid subscription for Unlimited captions (because running AI models is expensive), but I will share a promo code for a **free year with the first 5 people who comment** with a caption written by Jester! If you're not one of the first 5, don't worry because you can have 1 free month using the code [SUNDAY](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY) which can be redeemed at [https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY) (on iPhone or iPad)

What is the best application for customize keyboard shortcuts for macOS?,78,115t94f,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/115t94f/what_is_the_best_application_for_customize/,32,"Hi Apple community :),

I am new user to macOS system, I came from Linux (Ubuntu 20) and Windows 11, and I saw macOS keyboard shortcuts are different and also not all the keyboard shortcuts that available in Linux or Windows can be done with macOS, and hence I ask you what is the best third application for customize keyboard shortcut for macOS for my following needs:

1. Launching application from the dock by keyboard shortcut 'Windows key + number' (like in Windows 11)
2. Selecting text and paste it with mouse wheel click (like in Linux)

I believe in the future I will use much more keyboard shortcuts, I really love productive tools.  
I will be happy to hear from you on recommendation apps.

Clean installation of Ventura appears to automatically enable FileVault -- no recovery key supplied?,36,115xrk9,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/115xrk9/clean_installation_of_ventura_appears_to/,16,"When setting up a new machine or updating to a major release, one of the first things I do is enable FileVault.

I upgraded two machine this week. Using a USB installer, I wiped the SSD clean and started from scratch. Upon first login to Ventura, I went to enable FileVault. It was already enabled, and at no point was I ever given the recovery key. Apple Support has no answer other than ""turn it off, then turn it on and get a new recovery key"".

Great that they are trying to strengthen data protection on macOS; bad that they have left people in the dark on how to recover if something going wrong. Disabling/re-enabling is bullshit.

Not the newest in app backup that was made in WhatsApp that was made 3 days later ? Because it’s saved on the drive itself ? 

So essentially iOS will always load the iCloud backup before the WhatsApp in app backup ?

Apple Store Repair and Service is Really Dissapointing,0,1160ok3,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1160ok3/apple_store_repair_and_service_is_really/,22,"This is a bit of a rant, 

I spent a large part of today driving to and from the Apple Store to get my companies older 2015 15” MBP looked at. Random shutdowns on battery have been happening for a number of years but it hasn’t been a priority since it has been plugged in most of the time. We’ve recently brought someone new on and wanted to give them this Mac to use - but they need something reliable while being away from power. 

I was pretty sure the battery was the issue, but I did not want to get it replaced only for it to be something more serious like the logic board. We’re a small company and need to be smart about our expenses. The battery cycles are 280-300 for a 7 year old computer. I spent 30 minutes on Apple Chat last week and they recommended going in-store to get it looked at where they can do more in depth diagnostics. It’s a 40 min drive each way, but if it helps illuminate the issue then its worth it. 

First off, everyone at the Conestoga (Canada) Apple Store was very nice. My complaints are not about their direct service but the corporate policies they have to follow. 

They ran a diagnostic on the laptop and it came back with 80% battery health. They ran the diagnostic plugged in. I had it unplugged a couple of times at the Apple Store and it would shutdown as it usually does when the battery is sub 60%. In the rare cases where it does not shut down the battery drops really fast. 

I am more than willing to pay for the battery to be replaced. But, in order to replace the battery on the 2015 models they need to replace the top case (keyboard, trackpad). **Because the battery health is at 80% (and not 79% or lower) - they can’t replace the battery without charging me for a top case replacement! **The battery fee as quoted on their website is $250 (all prices in Canadian dollars), but with the mandatory top case replacement it jumps to around $700. Not worth it for a 7-8 year old computer. 

What frustrates me is, the Apple Tech in-store had no agency in the matter. It was clear as day the battery was failing and leading to restarts. Yet his own system would not let him order the battery replacement without the top case charge being applied because it was 1% over the required number for it to be eligible. His best solution was to use the laptop on battery as much as possible until it hits 79% and then to come back to get it fixed. Driving 40 mins each way again in the hope that they will replace the battery seems like a bit of a fools errand.

Over the last couple of years I have had other repair needs (Apple Watch battery, AirPods Connection issues) and the experience always ends up being the same. The people at the store can see the issue, but have no agency to get it fixed. 

This laptop in particular, was purchased at the Apple Store for $2500+ CAD, plus Apple Care +. We never used Apple Care before it expired and now we’re being denied a battery replacement (without paying the extra fee) because the health is 1% off replacement level according to their diagnostics. Yet the real world performance is clearly failing at a basic level. 

I am a little late to the game in getting Apple Devices, but my impression was that Apple had the best service and while they charge a lot for their tech - the support is top notch. That simply has not been my experience in any interaction I have had with them in the last 3-5 years. I don’t know if this is a Canada issue, or all Apple Stores. But I am just do disappointed in the entire process. I don’t have a lot of free time and to waste it on something like this is really frustrating.",1676778263.0

In early January, my M1 iPad Pro 12.9"" stopped charging about 16 months after purchasing. Now I am an electronics hobbyist and I know a thing or two about troubleshooting and I did all I could without opening the iPad. When I contacted apple support they told me I needed to make a Genius Bar appointment and the only ones available in a reasonable timeframe were during the work day. So I took a couple hours off to drive out the the apple store only to have to wait an extra 30m after my appointment time for the ""Genius"" to check the USB port for dust and verify it wasn't charging (Something I already did before) before telling me I was screwed and a replacement would be $800. I ended up taking it to a third party repair shop and they replaced the USB C port for $200.

Recently I noticed my AirPod Pro 2 case battery was draining about 20-25% per day without even using the earbuds. Apparently this is a common problem that multiple people report having. I called Apple and they guided me through resetting the device and told me to call them again if the problem persisted, so I did. When I called them again after testing, they told me I could schedule a Genius Bar appointment and get a replacement. So I repeat the process and drive out for the appointment and the ""Genius"" takes my AirPods to the back to run some tests. When he comes back out after 20m he tells me he could not find anything wrong with them and that my options were to live with the problem or send it in to an Apple repair center. I opted to send them in. We'll see if Apple lives up to their warranty or not...

Either way, each of these appointments took about 1h30m of my time only to have Apple's Genius representative to tell me to pound sand. In both of my experiences, the in-person representatives I met were unhelpful, uncompassionate, and slightly rude. Apple products cost way too much to have this poor of a support experience

"what happens if i downgrade my icloud storage, and what is the difference between not paying/not downgrading and downgrading?",24,1154se0,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1154se0/what_happens_if_i_downgrade_my_icloud_storage_and/,27,"first of all, here are some key points of information that you'll have to remember in my case  
1. i'm currently using the 200gb icloud storage plan, but i plan to downgrade soon (within around a week) in order to not have it required to be paid monthly (due to financial reasons)  
2. my iphone only has 64 gigabytes of storage; it is a pre-paid phone (which cannot be returned) and i do not have any other devices that are able to fully download all of my icloud storage  
if i were to downgrade my icloud storage from 200gb back to the default 5gb, what will happen to the rest of the data that exceeds it? (keep in mind that my iphone only has 64 gigabytes, and none of my devices have enough storage to download all of my icloud storage) if my photos won't sync to my icloud storage (uploading), will it still load the full-resolution images (downloading) when i view an image on my iphone that has been shrunken down to the optimized size?  
i read an article that said:  
""if you stop paying for your icloud storage, you will receive a pop-up on your phone telling you to pay. if you refuse, you will have 30 days to get your data from the cloud before it's erased permanently. if in those 30 days you decide to keep paying, all your stuff will remain there.""  
i have questions about this:  
there are 2 routes that are in question:  
1. the route where you simply do not pay for icloud storage and do not downgrade (which has already been specified that one will have 30 days to download all of the data before it gets wiped)   
2. the route where you downgrade your icloud storage to the default 5gb (which it is unknown to me what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb) to not have to pay monthly anymore  
for the second route, i wish to know what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb once i downgrade my icloud storage; what will happen to my backups? will my photos still be read from icloud storage (for full resolution)?  
tl;dr: i have very valuable data on my icloud storage that, due to financial reasons, cannot be kept paid monthly, so i plan to downgrade my icloud storage, and i can't download all of my icloud storage to any of my devices because they don't have enough storage either, so i ask 3 questions:  
1. what will happen to the data that exceeds the default 5gb?  
2. what will happen to my data backups?

If you're a MacBook Pro user, you may be familiar with the issues that have plagued the 2018 i9 models. Despite the significant price tag, these laptops suffer from severe overheating and throttling issues that can make the computer nearly unusable.

Many users have reported that their MacBook Pro i9s will overheat and then slow down or shut down to prevent damage to the system. This problem can occur even when the laptop is not under heavy load, making it difficult to use for even basic tasks.

What's even more frustrating is that Apple has remained largely silent on the issue. Despite numerous complaints and even a petition signed by over 11,000 people, the company has not taken any significant action to address the problem or compensate affected customers.

It's not right that users have to spend so much money on a product that fails to live up to its promises. It's even worse that Apple hasn't faced any consequences for this issue, leaving users feeling frustrated and unheard.

So I'm asking you, fellow MacBook Pro i9 users, do you think it's right that Apple hasn't faced any consequences for these issues? What steps should the company take to address the problem and make things right for affected customers?

Let's raise our voices and demand action from Apple on this issue. Our hard-earned money deserves a laptop that works properly. Thank you for your time and attention.",1676793595.0

Recommendations to improve Apple Health's Medications feature,33,114al8g,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/114al8g/recommendations_to_improve_apple_healths/,12,"# *TL;DR - Let's create a singular master thread of requests, to send to Apple, for Apple Health's Medication functionality.*

I was so excited by the new Medications offering in Apple Health. As a chronically ill person who has more than 12 medications to track (and often change) every day, I was relieved that Apple would finally offer us something that I wasn't getting from 3rd party apps, as well as the bonus of smooth integration across my Apple devices (really important for my physical disabilities). 

The initial offering is ok, but it has HUGE potential. I've no doubt Apple already has a long list of features and changes they plan to make with the functionality but I know from a product development standpoint, it's really important that they hear from the consumers which requests are most vital. I'm not entirely sure if they have, or plan to, consult with people who have chronic or complex health issues, but I do feel it's important we let them know they could really help improve our lives with a few tweaks. 

This realisation led me to start submitting through their [Health feedback form](https://www.apple.com/feedback/health/). Unfortunately there is a character limit and I know that most people will not submit a form for every single suggestion. I personally gave up after the first 5. So I've come to the conclusion of creating a master thread that can be shared with them directly. That's what I'm hoping to achieve here. 

If you use the Medications feature, or even just tried it but didn't continue, please have your say. If someone has already made a suggestion you agree with, upvote it! Please also include your country, as functionality currently varies and will be helpful to give context to your feedback/suggestion.

Thank you in advance 😊",1676608143.0

"Apple and Uber have left me empty-handed and out of pocket - $2,098.04 dollars worth of apple products stolen from an Uber Eats driver",1720,113gn1g,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/113gn1g/apple_and_uber_have_left_me_emptyhanded_and_out/,958,"I recently had a terrible experience with Apple and Uber that I wanted to share with you. I ordered an iPhone 14 Pro Max and an Apple Watch Ultra GPS watch through Apple's website, which were supposed to be delivered to me by UberEats. I paid extra for the items to be picked up from a local Apple store and hand-delivered to my address. The Uber driver assigned to the delivery falsely marked it as delivered and never showed up, despite my clear instructions and follow-up text messages. I waited outside the entire time and the delivery wasn't ever made.

I contacted Apple Support, and although they initially agreed to replace one of the items, the watch they later decided to cancel the replacement order, and denied me the replacement for the phone. The result of this has left me with a $2,098.04 hole in my pocket and leaving me with no other recourse. To add insult to injury, unfortunately, the police department is unable to file a report for civil matters.

I am deeply disappointed by the lack of assistance and resolution from both Uber and Apple. I have evidence of the conversations with the driver and video footage of me waiting for the delivery outside my building. My question to the community is, has anyone else ever experienced anything like this with Apple, and if so, do you have any recommendations on how to best address this matter?

I hope that my experience will serve as a cautionary tale and that both companies will take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. I realize that this is an unofficial community site for Apple and while I have no expectations of this message being seen by them, I wanted to raise awareness to everyone making purchases directly from the Apple store, especially via the use of third-party delivery services such as uber-eats and postmates.

**\*Update 02/16/2023\***

Today, I spent several hours speaking with various Apple representatives from the escalations team. Eventually, I was connected to a ""Senior Manager of the Online Store"" who informed me that the investigation into the matter has been closed and that Apple will not be pursuing any further investigations. According to Apple, a delivery was made, and they will not be compensating me for my losses. I requested evidence that the delivery was made to me personally, but the representative stated that information regarding the internal investigation could not be disclosed to me.

After my attempts to contact Apple and resolve this amicably, I feel like I have hit a dead end, and unfortunately, the criminal who stole my $2,098.04 worth of Apple products appears to be getting away with the theft. I am utterly speechless.

I made contact with a second police department in my area who was willing to make a police report and filed this under ""Grand theft"". I now have this along with the other evidence I've collected.

**\*Update 02/17/2023\***

I am pleased to inform you that a member of Apple's leadership team contacted me and has agreed to issue a full refund for the total cost of the stolen items.  I am thankful for the opportunity provided by Apple to resolve my issue. However, the refund process to my original payment method is still pending, which might take a few days considering the holiday on Monday in the US. I remain optimistic that I will receive my money back by Tuesday and will update this thread as soon as the entire amount has been refunded.

However, it is disheartening to know that the criminal responsible for this theft may get away with it. Sadly, this is the unfortunate reality of living in California. Nonetheless, I appreciate the effort and attention given to this matter by Apple's leadership team.

To the Apple subreddit community, I would like to express my gratitude for the valuable comments, feedback, and advice provided. Your input has been immensely helpful, and I sincerely appreciate your time and effort. Thank you all for your contributions.

**\*Update 02/22/2023\***

As of this morning, my bank account has been credited with the total refund amount as per the commitment made by Apple's leadership team.

I also wanted to highlight that despite the promise of two separate representatives asserting that the team responsible for handling loss/theft of items would be reaching out to me within 24-48 hours on the 16th (6 days ago), UberEats **never** made any attempt to contact me regarding this matter.",1676517563.0

Optimized Battery Charging,0,114y5a6,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/114y5a6/optimized_battery_charging/,41,"I'm considering taking the free iPhone my company offers - which I previously always declined.

Right now im looking into it again and am checking for the features and apps/ workflows that apparently don't ""just work"" with iOS.

One example is the smart charging. There seems to be a feature for determining how one uses his phone and then charging it till 80% and only completing the charge once the used algorithm deems it the right time. Right not I only charge my android for a few minute a day so that i reaches about 80% and have hard capped it there. Due to the slow charging speed iPhones I would charge it overnight and therefore need this feature to work properly.

From what I found online this system doesn't seem to work that well and on my girlfriends XR it deems 3AM the perfect time to be fully charged... 

So why is there no setting to set a specific time for the phone to be fully charged or even better, have it depend on the set alarm time of the next day? Is there a way to set these obviously needed settings and I just didn't find them?

Are there other ways to fix this?",1676669324.0

Whats the point of 2FA if you can just change your password on your iPhone without it?

They made her write down her Apple password.  Then of course they changed the password on her Apple account.  Apple is of no help recovering her Account and of course the phone is gone, etc.

After being glad the girl is OK, I thought for sure that I was protected from something like this because I have 2FA.

Nope!  When you head to settings, it says, ""Because you are logged into iCloud, you can change your password.""  No 2FA!  Then it says ""you want to log out of all your other devices?""

Every other little thing I log into, for instance the New York Times that I signed up for using Apple's anonymous email service, requires me to use 2FA.  

So why when changing the password am I not required to do any 2FA?  Is it because if you lose your password they could just send it to your email which is on your phone anyway?  

Is there a way to truly theft-proof your phone?   Because when a gun is pointed at you, its a good idea to fork everything over including passwords.",1676570375.0

Notes, reminders (more on that later), unlock your devices with the watch, airDrop etc. It would be really hard to switch back to PC/Android as it doesn't really have any of that. However...

Apple watch can unlock my iPhone and MacBooks but not my iPad. One of my laptops is 7-8 years and my iPad is the latest pro with m2.

The Books app knows my position in ebooks across devices but for audio books (bought in the apple store) it doesn't sync. Also, if I'm listening to an audio book on my iPhone there is no indication of this in ""playing now"" on my Apple watch.

If I leave my computer somewhere that isn't my home and then leave I will get a notification on my apple watch that I left it behind. If I leave it at home I don't get that notification. So far so good. But even if I go out for a walk with the dog I will always get a notification that my iPad is left behind.

If I listen to a song on Apple music on my phone and pause it then tell Siri on my watch to continue playing music it will play whatever I played on my watch before.

"There is something wrong with the Mouse, Cursor, and Magic Trackpad 2 in M1/M1*/M2 Macs.",543,110dozc,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/110dozc/there_is_something_wrong_with_the_mouse_cursor/,190,"This is gonna be quite a long post but **if you are also affected by the mouse cursor stuttering and jumping, either with the internal Trackpad or with the external Magic Trackpad 2 feel free to chime in and share your results, experiences, workarounds etc.** Anything that would help the community to overcome this issue.

&#x200B;

# Background

I bought my first arm-based Macbook Air 2 years ago as a backup device. My main workstation was still my Intel Mac. Whenever I used the M1, I noticed some cursor stutter after about 20 minutes of working or so. It's like the refresh rate for the cursor suddenly drops to like 24fps.

This is NOT the general slowdown that you experience when the CPU is busy or the memory is full. It can happen when doing nothing but clicking through items in the finder with nothing else ressource-hungry going on in the background,

What ""fixed"" it for a few minutes was to close the lid, open it again, maybe repeat that a few times and the cursor was back normal. This has already been discussed a lot in threads on Reddit and I'm surprised to find the exact same issues still being present after more than 2 years of arm Macs.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago I had to upgrade my main workstation (Intel MacBook) to an ARM-based Mac. I set up my Magic Trackpad on it. Of course, each new device can feel weird at first but after the first hour of using I noticed that I am still kind of unsuccessful at hitting buttons, marking text etc.

\- Everything felt imprecise,- the refresh rate would randomly drop like I know it from my 2020 backup mac,- additionally, the cursor would take random jumps of like 5cm/ 2 inches across the screen.

My productivity dropped as I had to second-guess and correct each cursor movement to get there where I wanted to get. My wrist started hurting on that very day (wrist joint issues were the reason I had to purchase a Magic Trackpad 2 a few years ago in first place and I absolutely loved the Trackpad ever since).

&#x200B;

# Radio?

I had somewhat similar issues when first moving to a USB-C Mac (the first Intel that required dongles for HDMI, USB etc.) when using a third-party dongle as this has disturbed the radio on the Mac. So back then I bought the original Apple dongle as well which solved these radio issues (also discussed in great extent across reddit).

This case here is not about radio tho, I also experience these issues when not being connected to an external screen, and not having the dongle plugged in.

&#x200B;

# Third party apps?

Some forum post said that third party apps cause this, so based on Apple Support's advice I went into safe mode and only used Safari for my work, no external screen, no other apps opened: Same results.

&#x200B;

# Comparison with Intel?

Thinking I'd go crazy I placed my old Intel mac at the exact same spot on my desk to see if this suffers the same problem. I was blown away at how smooth the Magic Trackpad cursor was on my Intel Mac. It felt like it had twice the refresh rate, twice the precision and none of the pain that comes with using the arm Mac. I need to mention that the Intel and the ARM Mac have the same apps installed because I transfered the whole installation from the Intel Mac to the ARM Mac.

&#x200B;

# Comparison with other Macs?

As I know the next step would be a replacement device, I was curious whether that would fix things. To cancel out any issues with apps on my ARM Mac, or with my ARM Mac's hardware even further, I've tried a few friends' ARM Macs (these friends also all know the cursor refresh rate issue on their ARM Mac but don't use a Magic Trackpad). Needless to say, the exact same issues started happening with my friends' computers as well. I attached my ""old"" arm backup Mac and the issue happened on that device as well. To give a short summary:

&#x200B;

\`\`\`

M1 Air 2020 on macOS 12.6: Problems

M2 Air 2022 on macOS 13.1: Problems

Intel Pro 2018 on macOS 12.6.2: NO Problems, smooth cursor

\`\`\`

(Tested with more devices too but this cancels out any macOS version issues)

&#x200B;

# Radio part 2 - connection via cable?

Then I found this thread:

[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363) (21 “Me too”)

For testing, I’ve connected the Trackpad via a lightning cable. It is way better that way. Is it possible that the radio in the MacBook Air M2 is much weaker or placed unfortunately? It really isn’t usable with the arm-based MacBooks.

However, the connection via cable isn't perfect either - While working, after a few days suddenly the cursor was unresponsive, the Trackpad couldn’t move or click for a few seconds. After that, it went back to being so wonky again, as if the cable wasn’t attached. Frame rate of the cursor also seemed lower and everything felt indirect. As if the mouse driver went into some kind of compatibility mode that doesn’t do any of the magic that cursor tracking usually involves. Like toggling mouse acceleration in Windows, it feels completely different and weird suddenly. As soon as that happened, I started mis-clicking buttons again because I constantly either overshoot cursor positions (like going past the button that I intended to click) or undershoot them (not reaching the desired cursor position in the first move). Temporarily moving to the Intel Mac, I hit everything as precise as I used to do. To cancel out any bias, I also did tests where I didn't know which device I was connected to and I could always tell the smoothness of the Intel vs the awful navigation in the ARM.

&#x200B;

# Internal Trackpad?

Apart from that, as mentioned in the beginning I also often see the cursor stuttering even with the inbuilt Trackpad. It’s like the refresh rate of the cursor drops:

[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253713321](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253713321) (221 ""Me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253395232](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253395232) (173 ""Me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252777347](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252777347)[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252957160](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252957160) (91 ""Me too"")[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253672108](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253672108) (64 ""Me too"")[https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/qj77mq/cursor\_lag\_continues\_on\_monterey\_m1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/qj77mq/cursor_lag_continues_on_monterey_m1/) (109 upvotes)[https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/u486mi/macbook\_pro\_13\_m1\_trackpad\_cursor\_lag\_issue\_no/](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/u486mi/macbook_pro_13_m1_trackpad_cursor_lag_issue_no/) (125 upvotes)

&#x200B;

# Trackpad / Radio / Cursor delay?

Additionally, I've taken slo mo recordings to measure the delay between my finger moving on the internal Trackpad + external Magic Trackpad and the cursor moving on screen with both processor architectures - I can't find any significant delays that way either. So it doesn't seem to be a latency issue.

&#x200B;

# Verdict

My best guess till now:

* ARM Macs have another set of mouse drivers, causing the refresh rate to drop
* ARM Macs have another set of mouse drivers that have different curves for interpolating and accelerating signals.
* ARM Macs have some additional radio issues, that don't cause all of the problems, but add to them

In any case, my wrist hurts. Doing the lightning cable thing already helps a lot but I still need to restart the computer every few days due to the above-mentioned issue of the cursor messing up even on lightning. Also, even with the cable attached, it still doesn't feel as direct and smooth as on the Intel Mac.

&#x200B;

# How to go from here?

I've spent way too much time on this problem already but I'm required to use a macOS device for work and right now it looks like I will have some bad time ahead in the next few years if there is no solution in sight. If you have any info to share, let's work together to be either to either find a workaround, or gather enough information so Apple can finally acknowledge the problem and address it.",1676201548.0

"Elephas - Personal AI Writing Assistant for Mac, iPhone, and iPad (Ver 5.3 released)",3,110gqi0,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/110gqi0/elephas_personal_ai_writing_assistant_for_mac/,25,"Hello [r/apple](/r/apple)

I am an independent developer from India.

I have built an app called [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-promo-sunday-1202-01), a personal AI Writing assistant that works seamlessly across all your Mac apps, as well as an AI-enabled keyboard for your iPhone and iPad.

Just released a new version of the app last week.

Update: Elephas and ChatGPT are not the same; they have slightly different use cases. Elephas applies an AI layer on top of your Mac while you continue to follow your workflow.

**Version 5.3 Updates:**

In the latest version, I have released features such as -

**Snippets -** Configure shortcuts to perform day-to-day tasks with the help of AI. It supports all popular languages. You can do tasks across your apps, including editors and spreadsheet tools.

**Tones** - To personalize text output and write in your own unique style.

**Preserve Formatting** - So that the generated text maintains the format and styling of the original text.

And many more tiny improvements and utilities.

# A brief overview of the tool -

First off, very pleased to share that now 500+ professional users use the app every day :)

Elephas helps business professionals use AI to save time on day-to-day tasks. Emails, documents, blogs, JIRA stories, social media posts, etc.

Our users praise it as a Swiss Army knife for their daily productivity.

**""An AI tool that they actually use in their daily workflow""**

It differs from other AI tools in that it works on top of your favorite apps, so there is no need to switch between windows or work in a browser window.

You can get the power of AI within your favorite Mac apps like Mail, Pages, Docs, and any other apps built for the Mac.

With Elephas,

*   You can rewrite your content, improve it or even generate new content on a topic.
    
*   You can use it to quickly reply to your emails, messages, and social media posts.
    
*   You can even use it for creating presentations and generating excel formulas.
    
*   And now you can even define your own tasks with the ""Snippets"" feature.
    

Based on our user requests, I introduced the AI assistant to iOS devices (beta).

It follows the same philosophy, wherein you can use the writing assistant without leaving the app you are writing on.

So you can use an AI keyboard within Whatsapp, Mail, iMessage, etc.

Here's the demo of how the AI keyboard works -

[https://youtu.be/Y5vrH3Clgyo](https://youtu.be/Y5vrH3Clgyo)

There is a wide range of utility features built into the app to make your daily workflow smooth and fast with the power of AI.

**One last point**

The app is privacy friendly. You can use your own OpenAI keys, and none of your data is stored on our servers.

You can check out the tool on the website here -  [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-sunday-promo-1202-02).

There are a whole lot of videos here in this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpv207Ven3s1Hmfcq9lqG74eRzJicbmoy).

**You can try the app for FREE for 30 days.**

I will appreciate your support and feedback.

Thanks.",1676211467.0

I hope/suspect Apple isn't letting another AI opportunity slip,60,10ywq5a,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10ywq5a/i_hopesuspect_apple_isnt_letting_another_ai/,179,"**Generative AI**  is here to stay and change our way of living once again. They’re in their infancy, but getting better very rapidly. Big tech companies understand this new AI as a massive part of all our futures. Staking a claim and building a leadership position is as important as dominating the web was in the 90s.

Microsoft announced a new conversational search feature you can start using right now in Bing AND the Edge browser. Google on the other hand just shot themselves in the food with panicking and rushing their Bard thing. 

**Where is apple in all of this?**

Apple has the tools to build its own generative AI with the Neural Engine built into iPhone and Mac chips that is capable of up to 15.8 trillion operations per second, along with Core ML and machine learning APIs. After all, apple spearheaded AI once with Siri....But we haven’t seen any movement jet

***Conclusion:*** Apple has positioned itself as a technology leader for years now. I don't think they are so badly lead, that apple will give that up! Of course, Apple is one of the most secretive companies in tech, especially when it comes to software. Apple could have big teams working hard to bring generative AI features soon. (They bought at least o ne generative AI company: AI Music) I hope we get a surprise at a coming WWDC: World-class generative AI all over Apple’s products! (I really hope that’s the case, because if they are late to the game on such a transformational technology, it’s going to doom its software to being years behind its competitors)

iPhone users - do you want RCS?,130,10yh4z1,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10yh4z1/iphone_users_do_you_want_rcs/,263,"If Apple were to adopt RCS would you find it beneficial? Do you text enough friends/family with Androids that it would excite you? 

Genuinely curious if iOS users have any desire for the feature. Clearly Tim Cook doesn’t think so.

Edit 1: Results:

So based on the feedback we have a pretty mixed bag. 

1) Majority of folks are open to it as long as it’s not overseen by Google (none of you use a Gmail already??). Which makes the most sense to me, Apple will always do it the Apple way and would find a way to have full control over it as they always do imo. 

2) lots of you (mainly Europeans) who could care less either way. I envy you, it would be nice if this didn’t even need to be a conversation. Please feel free to convince anyone in NA to download 1-2 messaging apps to accommodate android users… you’ll understand our pain. 

3) smaller portion of the crowd are in the hard no camp. Main reason seems to be Googles involvement or no reasoning given. 

Interesting spread of results. I sit in the camp of why not improve the experience for all users regardless of platform if there is a clear roadmap on how to do it? Not saying RCS in its current form is the final best option, but it’s a foundation that can be built on.",1676006523.0

Will Siri ever become more intelligent?,386,10x2b95,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10x2b95/will_siri_ever_become_more_intelligent/,257,"As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, one question that has been on many people's minds is whether or not Siri will ever become more intelligent. Apple has been quiet about their releases and advancements, but with Microsoft and Google both releasing advanced AI models for search, it begs the question: what could Apple be working on?

There are several probable scenarios in which Apple has a chance to take the lead in the AI race. For one, they have already made significant advancements in on-device processing, which could serve as a foundation for further improvements. They have also announced an AI Summit event later this year. Additionally, Apple has a reputation for keeping their cards close to their chest, so it's possible that they are silently working on something revolutionary.

The competition in the AI space is fierce, with Microsoft and Google both making giant steps forward in recent months. It's not just a battle between these two tech giants, though, and many people are hoping that Apple will soon join the fray. Bing's reawakening and Google Bard's offering coming up to everyone. 

The future of AI is uncertain, but one thing is for sure: the competition is heating up. Whether or not Apple will be able to go to the next level remains to be seen, but the advancements being made by other companies serve as a reminder of the gigantic steps that companies have to take in order to stay ahead of the game. It kind of feels like 10 years ago when we had a new smartphone release every week... we tried all kinds of new UI features, and the iOS vs Android war was full steam, I'm excited to see what's gonna happen!

What do you think? Will Siri ever become more intelligent? How do you see Apple fitting into the AI landscape in the future? Let's have a discussion!",1675872062.0

Heads up: New iPhone and Watch trade in boxes can cause confusion,66,10xd7br,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10xd7br/heads_up_new_iphone_and_watch_trade_in_boxes_can/,14,"I just wanted to share here a new issue that I dealt with this year, that I haven’t previously experienced, to hopefully save someone else the trouble.

Previously when I had traded in my iPhone and Watch, I recall the boxes being a bit different. This year I traded in both, and I received two boxes that to me were identical. They both had instructions for the phone and watch, I recall no clear marking to indicate which was which. I’ll tell you why this mattered.

I accepted a trade in of my phone for $550, and $155 for my watch. Apparently, I mixed up the boxes (still not knowing how I could have known the difference). This resulted in my phone being sent as trade in for the watch, and my watch being sent as trade in for the phone.

Now since I had sent a $550 device in place of a trade in for a $155 device, Apple sent me a gift card for the difference. Since I sent in a $155 device in place of a trade in for a $550 device, Apple had to charge me the difference.

So I ended up having to pay extra out of pocket than originally planned, and the only saving grace is that I now have an Apple gift card for the difference. Which isn’t really what I wanted, I wasn’t planning on spending any more money in their store for a few months.

I apologize if this is hard to follow, but the PSA here is this: If you trade in a phone and a watch at the same time, be VERY sure you know which box is for which, because if you get it wrong the whole process is super confusing and you’ll pay more than you intended to.",1675895918.0

What’s up with Apple’s design choices in recent years?,12,10vpg8q,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10vpg8q/whats_up_with_apples_design_choices_in_recent/,19,"They’re just all over the place it seems like, between being unsure of what color schemes to stick with (see Mac desktop models in primary pastel colors vs. iPhone/iPad/watch/Macbook colors remaining pretty much neutral/industrial) and the fact that Apple cannot decide on what screen bezel design they want to move towards, where is the consistency?
Like most of the industry at this point, they are trying to move away from notched phones and towards fullscreen-ish designs, but while introducing the dynamic island design to iPhones/just starting to move away from the notch, they’re now implementing the notch in previously-fullscreen Macbook models—all while the iPad has moved to a bezeled fullscreen design. Additionally, Apple is still pushing the square-edged iPhone/iPads while the watch line still retains the pill-shaped bodies of older iPhone models, seen from the iPhone 6 to 11 models.

Does this inconsistency seem apparent to anyone else or am I just nitpicking? How do you feel about the trends in Apple’s design choices of recent years?",1675735731.0

Apple Health & Fitness future?,19,10vh6ue,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10vh6ue/apple_health_fitness_future/,17,"Hey everyone,

As someone who recently switched to Apple ecosystem, I am trying to learn more about the products and how to build up my ecosystem with meaningful additions. The way I do it is that I search for the products and examine their current state / features and what is coming. In general I am really satisfied with my MBP and iPhone.

However, as a pervious Garmin Epix2 owner (now AWU), this is where I feel Apple lacks the most and thought it wouldn't be the case. I am not an extreme athlete, I don't need GPS tracking or outdoor stuff trackings - I am dude that goes to gym, doing strength training. So in terms of 'workout' support, I am not that interested in that.

What I find Garmin does way better is the features like: Stress Management, Body Battery, Readiness Score , Morning Report, Step counting, and ..  most interesting to me, Insights. 

At the moment, I have following Apps: Autosleep, HeartWatch and Athlytic (+ Centr for Fitness App). There is no Fitness+ in my country. I did pay for the premium, but I still find it lacklustre, compared to Garmin or even Fitbit (I tested Pixel Watch for a while). 

I do not like the idea of having soo many third party apps, but if they would provide me with data the way I imagine Apple would do (nice UI/UX, straight to the point, no need to be data scientist to understand insights, etc.), I'd be completely fine with that.

So I came here wondering, if any of you have any info on what is Apple's plan in regards to Health & Fitness features? I learned that they have a dedicated executive role for Apple Health, so I would assume they would make big leaps here - but couldn't find any info on roadmaps or future features.

Did I do my research poorly and the apps I chose are simply not the best for this? Then I would be happy to test some you would suggest for me. For me, I don't need lots of raw data, but rather explanation of data and what can I do about it or what does it tell me about me / my pattern.

  
Examples:

\- You had only 10min of deep sleep. It is advisable to have X amount for your age and goals. Try going to sleep at Y time and do \*this\* before going to bed.

\- You did only 100 steps so far. It is recommended to do at least XXXX steps per day. To target that goal  you need need to do 250 steps per hour. Get moving now! (And it would actually track steps, not the 'Stand Time' like Apple Watch does).

\- Your HRV was quite low during the night and your RHR was a bit increased. It seems you did not get enough rest during the night, so track your readiness score throughout the day. If you would like to exercise today, try having a nap in afternoon.

\- etc.

Now it could be AutoSleep  / Athlytic / HeartWatch does say that SOMEWHERE amidst tons of numbers and data, but I would like to have it as an 'Insight' section or a Push notification.",1675715316.0
Hello from /r/Android! Where do you see the industry going?,110,10uwz6b,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10uwz6b/hello_from_randroid_where_do_you_see_the_industry/,78,"As a Pixel owner, I'm seeing the subreddit on team green grow incredibly stagnant. Personally l use whatever gets the job done, and it feels like that is such a low bar now be it Windows vs Mac or Android vs iOS. Cheap and expensive devices alike are incredibly powerful, versatile, fast and efficient.

On the Android side all anyone seems to care about are foldables, and now each OEM is really trying to make their own ""thing"". Pixel wants AI, computational photography and automation to be its thing, and these are useful, but far from earth shattering. It all just doesn't feel as exciting as it once was, everything is plateauing. I'm so bored looking at benchmarks and tiny little tweaks to numbers.

I'm curious to see where you all think the industry is going? Are phones simply an upgrade every 2-3 years now thing or is the industry going to rock itself again? Has the industry matured and have we reached (or are near) peak smartphone?",1675655951.0

"What do YOU do with your MacBook, and what can you teach me?",1,10v9nw3,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10v9nw3/what_do_you_do_with_your_macbook_and_what_can_you/,125,"My M2 Max got delayed so I thought to make this post to help fill my void. I’m looking for a bunch of ideas and suggestions on what I can do with my new computer. For some context, it’s my first Mac. I had a PC like 10 years ago and finally needed to update and since everything else I have is in the ecosystem I went with a MacBook this time. 

I’d love to learn new things such as coding, whether it be in app development or in data science. I have friends that do both and it seems interesting and fun. I have started to get into photography as well, I have a 13 Pro and I love taking photos with it. I do a lot of cooking and frequently write down my recipes and take photos in case I ever want to create content. 

What do you guys use your MacBooks for? What programs do you recommend? Any specific courses for improving my skills or learning new ones? I’m in my mid-late 20’s, don’t even work in my degree, and might be looking to move to a new city, so if I get good at any of this stuff I’ll definitely switch it up haha. 

Thanks for your help everyone!

Edit: To everyone telling me to cancel the order, half the cost of this was covered so I’m paying 2 grand for a 4k machine. I’m not cancelling, I’d rather have an overpowered machine that I can learn to utilize in time rather than one that I’ll need to upgrade again later. I appreciate you guys looking after my wallet all the same.",1675698007.0
I created a Smart Diary that allows you to have your own AI. Called Moolight - Smart Diary,141,10ub8we,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10ub8we/i_created_a_smart_diary_that_allows_you_to_have/,45,"[Download Moolight - Smart Diary](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/moodlight-intelligent-note/id1631169735)

Instead of writing a long journal, I love taking short notes throughout the day, in a bullet point format. In this way, I could better record the thoughts that could otherwise be forgotten.

My girlfriend writes diary every day. The problem she had is that after writing for years, there is no good way to see the changes in yourself, even though all texts are there.

We tried very hard to search for an app that could fit our need. But failed. **As a result, we took a lot of time to learn and develop our first take on this idea. Of a smart note app.**

**Moolight** is our answer. It features an on-device AI that could help us organize the piece of ideas into 15 categories. And try to provide some insights and feedbacks from all the notes automatically.

We don't want to sacrifice any privacy, as a result, a decision is made to keep all data to yourself & your own iCloud. After tested out the idea, we found a way to make it even smarter and fit your own record style. As a result, you could train your absolutely unique AI on your device in Moolight.

The more you write and correct the category, the better your own AI gets. In our own test, with the default AI, the accuracy is about 70% correctness. If you write for about 20 days with 5 bullet points per day, and correct the category. Your could own a unique AI that do chores sorting out your notes 100% categories correctness for all your notes.

&#x200B;

**Why bother creating another note app?**

Complex tools makes it's easy to get lost. When using simple tools, the notes could easily scattered everywhere. Why can't software help? We live in an age when technology advances every day, yet the software for notes seem to become unchanged since long time ago.

That's why we spent long time, realizing this idea. And had great fun developing this product. The idea is about writing without being disturbed. Enjoy the ease of use brought by technological advances while having absolute privacy.

&#x200B;

**Design Thoughts**

My girlfriend is a data scientist, and I had background in software and design. We wanna to combine our experiences, and attempt to give this idea our best effort. Since day one, we discussed and settled on the following ground rules:

1. We believe everyone should be the sole owner of our data, especially in a case for note or diary. So data never leaves your device or iCloud. All data should be processed on-device with neural engine. It should be 100% functional when offline.
2. We wanna it to be smart, to make life easier. To do this, it should know how we feel when we write; It should know the realtime weather so my gf don't need to type in manually; It should know I'm writing about food, without specifying the category. It should be able to track anything that we ever want to know if we wrote about it.
3. We wanna it to be able to think. To write a short headline each day and help us recall. It should know the top content I'm constantly writing about, and use my data to give us some feedback. We wanna it know them all, yet do not ask for any information besides what I actually write.

&#x200B;

**Why there are three tabs?**

Today, Gallery and Insights.

The idea is that whenever you want to write something, it's in the Today tab, this is where you focus on the moment. When you want to have a look at the past. All the information is well organized and truthfully present to you in Gallery tab.

We can't predict the future. However, in some way, we could also get a glimpse of idea about future based on what we were doing in the past. This is what Insights tab do.

▶ Today ◀ • Bullet Based Input • Automatic added Weather & Location • Mood Lights to Know Your Feeling • Time Travel to Past and Future • Dynamic Background that Flows.

▶ Gallery ◀ • Refined Card with Mood Color • Daily Auto Headline • Auto Classification for Each Input • Powerful Search by Time and Types.

▶ Insights ◀• Cumulative Days, and Inputs Count • Weekly Glance to be Surprised • Keyword to Know What Mattered • Track Anything as Tags • Know What made you Happy with Mood Trend • Random Show to Recall Memories • Mapped Journey to Mark your Path • Liked/Web Records to Shortcut • Customize Modules on Your Preference.

• iCloud Sync and Backup for iPhone/iPad/Mac • Face ID for Additional Safety • Customize Color, Typography, etc • Recycled Bin for Accidental Delete • Automatic Light and Dark Mode.

&#x200B;

**What can it do?**

**• Intelligent Classification**

Declutter the life events. Work, Food, Study and so on. It just knows.

**• Understand Your Mood**

How’s your day? Moolight will do the best guess.

**• Multiple Organizers**

Event, Emotions, Keywords, Maps, etc. Multiple ways to visualize the data.

&#x200B;

Since it's unlike any existing note or diary product in the market. It takes time to get familiar with Moolight, and once you get familiar with it, hopefully you'll grow the love of it like we did. Moolight is released to the App Store on the first day of 2023. And we're still trying very hard to polish it.

Would love to hear your thoughts about it.",1675599818.0

PSA: Don’t let Apple deny your request to update Date of Purchase for a brand new previous-gen product.

I just bought a Series 6 from an online retailer just last week and set it up today. After set up, I noticed that it said “Coverage Expired”. Weird but no biggie, I’ll just call Apple and it’ll be sorted out soon. Or so I thought. 

First CSR asked me to provide proof of payment which I gladly did. I even screenshared my phone to show the receipt in my email. He asked me to upload my screenshots. No problemo. He then transfers me to another CSR.

I’m 20 minutes into what I thought would be 5 mins. The second CSR informs me that due to the fact that it’s a Series 6 they can’t update the Date of Purchase. Excuse me? I bought it brand new from a reputable retailer (Sportchek). It wasn’t open box or anything. The box was sealed. The CSR gives me this gem: because the AW was shipped to the retailer in 2020, they cannot update the Date of Purchase. 

This was shocking to hear. I told her that it doesn’t matter to me as the end consumer when a product was shipped to the retailer. I bought it new and they have to honour the manufacturer’s warranty. She transfers me to her manager. 

I’m now 45 minutes into this call. Manager gets on the phone and asks me what the issue was. I explained how I’m being told that Apple does not cover its own new products just because of when they were shipped to a retailer. She apologizes and agrees with me and goes ahead and approves the update to the Date of Purchase. Finally!! 

Took me almost an hour on the phone to get done what should have never been an issue in the first place. So DO NOT let Apple reject your request to update the Date of Purchase if you bought a NEW Apple product. Consumer laws exist to protect the end users from this sort of bs.",1675450578.0

Discussion: The friction between using an iPhone and Windows Computer,14,10rwgvj,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10rwgvj/discussion_the_friction_between_using_an_iphone/,9,"I have an iPhone. I also have a Windows PC at home and use a Windows PC at work. I use the Windows PC at work because I must, and I use the Windows PC at home because it’s a requirement for my online Business Administration Degree. Additionally, I've always liked Windows because it's what I'm used to. 

Most of my personal life is on my iPhone. The native calendar, reminder, and notes app all seamlessly connect to help me manage my life and be productive. I have notes integrated with the reminders app and reminders set out way into the future. This runs my life.

I’m really loving using Windows more and more every day. Whether it’s for school, work, or for personal use. The programs I’ve used are so feature rich. They’re a pleasure to use and find out all the possible capabilities that can help me be productive. Lately, I’ve been learning more and more about Excel and OneNote. It’s honestly been fun and I’m enjoying myself quite a bit.

This leads me to a point of friction. I love using Windows App’s on my PC, but my whole life is wrapped up on an iPhone which I also enjoy. The webpages for iPhone apps are quite garbage (looking at you Apple Notes). I’m considering making the switch from Apple to Windows and migrating all my notes and reminders to Windows apps. 

My question is this: Is it worth it? For those with an iPhone and Windows PC, which apps do you use to manage your personal life? Are you frustrated with the limitations? More generally, what is your workflow?",1675361443.0

Recently I was using the Air 2 again, and realised it had such a better battery life vs the Pro. Despite being several years older (battery deterioration), it has crazy good standby time and lasts longer whole browsing or watching videos.

If you travel often using public transit you might find Glarm useful.

With Glarm you can set alarm to ring, let’s say 5 kilometres from your destination and in the meantime, take a nap, or watch a movie without worrying about missing the stop.

"I've just released Pestle 1.4 with Smart Folders, PDF Import, Image Import and more!",147,10o90rl,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10o90rl/ive_just_released_pestle_14_with_smart_folders/,44,"Hey r/Apple! 

I'm Will, a 20-year-old developer from Adelaide, Australia. I build [Pestle, an intelligent recipe manager for iPhone & iPad](https://apple.co/3sWeyWl) (The Mac version is coming along well, and it will be worth the wait!).

If you're not already familiar with Pestle, [checkout the launch post from 6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/sgctww/ive_just_released_pestle_transform_any_recipe/). But in short, Pestle is a Recipe Organiser that lets you save recipes from any website.

# Smart Folders

This is one is really cool! Pestle now has 'Smart Folders', which fill themselves up based on the criteria you set. Want to filter your 400 recipes down to just 4-star or higher desserts that aren't alcoholic beverages? Easy! As you save new recipes to Pestle, they'll automatically be added to your Smart Folders.

# PDF Import

This one is for those of you with Cookbooks as PDFs. Pestle can now show you your PDF Cookbook and will guide you through adding your favourites to Pestle. Once saved, Pestle will use its smarts to enable you to scale recipes, convert them, and more. 

# Image Import

Much like PDF Importing, Pestle can now handle photos you've taken of recipe cards and the like, with Live Text on iOS 16, scanning photos into Pestle is a breeze.

### Search Improvements

This is a smaller one, but worth a mention. Sometimes when searching across your large collection, exactly _why_ a recipe shows up might not be clear. You may search for ""Italian"", and a recipe with ""Italian Herbs"" will show up. Now search results will show in the top right exactly _why_ they're there, like ""Matches Ingredient"" or ""Main Course"".

# Privacy First

Frankly, it's none of my business what you cook with Pestle, where you share it to, etc etc. That's why the [Privacy Policy](https://pestlechef.app/privacy) is so short, there's very little for me to say. First and foremost, **Pestle does not collection identifiable information** (with the only exception of your email, if you even consider that identifiable, and also only **if you use email signup**, if you use Sign In with Apple/Google, then this doesn’t apply. For analytical purposes, I do track daily active users, version breakdowns and such. **But none of this information is tracked back to you, it is 100% anonymous**. I use [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com), a privacy-focused platform use by many other popular apps, such as Apollo for Reddit.


That sums up this update, it's my biggest update since releasing Live Activities (among other things), so I hope you like it :)

I would love for you to give it a try, so go get [Pestle on the App Store](https://apple.co/3sWeyWl)!",1675002888.0
"I just released Oolong v2, a ""future forward"" budget app that can help you control the ""shape"" of your money!",72,10o7g9n,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10o7g9n/i_just_released_oolong_v2_a_future_forward_budget/,28,"Hey /r/apple, 

Just launched Oolong *v2* after two years of doing other... stuff 🙈

#### [GET IT HERE](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1549289924)

---

**TL;DR:** 

Oolong is a ""future forward"" budget app that helps users control the ""shape"" of their money. Whereas other apps like Mint, YNAB, and [Envy](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/q5dd4a/i_created_a_budgeting_app_that_doesnt_collect_any/) are great at helping users understand ""what happened"", Oolong is all about predicting ""what *will* happen"" so that you can make smarter financial decisions **today**.

---

**What's New?**

Oolong is the reason I picked up iOS development 3 years ago. The [original app](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/) was, admittedly pretty basic, but it got the job done! This latest version is everything that I've learned a lot about building enterprise apps over these last couple years along with: 

- Completely new design (as requested by [/u/Darpyface](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glj008n/))
- Balance Sheets and Income Statements
- Multiple Accounts (as requested by [/u/John-McAfee](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glicfor/))
- Decimals! (as requested by [/u/lizadting](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/gli07qb/))

---

**Use cases**

I've been using the Oolong methodology for over a decade (then just an Excel spreadsheet). It's the singular tool that I use to manage my money. Hearing from several v1 users, many have used Oolong to: 

- Figure out how much to allocate to savings/investments
- Plan major one-time purchases
- Figure out ""how much apartment"" to rent/buy

---

**Freemium**

Oolong is free for the first 3 accounts (assets/liabilities) and 7 plan items (incomes/transfers/expenses). An ""In App Upgrade"" can be purchased to unlock unlimited accounts and plan items, as well as remove ads.

I really think that Oolong can help users escape the ""paycheck-to-paycheck"" trap. So, if you use and love Oolong, but can't afford the upgrade right now, please send me a quick email at oolong@bracket.ltd with a little explanation about how you hope to use Oolong to improve finances and I'll endeavour to send you a code!

"Is this the Mandela effect, or did Apple announce wireless Bluetooth or NCF tags for retailers around 2015?",596,10nvn0a,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10nvn0a/is_this_the_mandela_effect_or_did_apple_announce/,156," I've tried looking into this for a little while and I can find no trace of it on the internet.

I swear I have a memory from probably around 2015 of a WWDC video where Tim Cook was advertising NFC/Bluetooth/similar devices to brick and mortar retailers. I cant remember what their value proposition was, but it provided some digital services to customers.  Maybe you download apps, order online, or similar - basically a glorified QR code. Sorry, my memory is very patchy.

Outside of the mention at the WWDC, I have no other memory of it (never saw it on their website, in person, etc). That, plus me being unable to figure out an actual use case for this product, plus not being able to find anything about it on the internet is making me thinking I've just made this up!

Does anyone else remember anything like this, or have I lost the plot!?

What is the purpose of making a service appointment?,20,10nld96,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10nld96/what_is_the_purpose_of_making_a_service/,12,"A week ago I made an appointment to get my battery changed. The price is being hiked in March, and my phone is a few years old still on the original battery. May as well change it before the price hike as it is noticeably weaker. (On my 6s I'd change the battery myself, but honestly I cba to replace iphone batteries myself now). 

So I made an appointment online, where I input that I was coming in for a battery replacement, the day I wanted, the store I would be at, and the type of phone I have. I even got the email & text reminder about my appointment this morning, so I drive to the Apple store, get checked in, wait for a staff member to be available, start the initial info gathering part of the process.......just to be told the store doesnt have my battery in stock, and they would have to order it and wait 3-5 business days.

What was the point of the appointment?!? They knew when I was coming in, they knew what store I was going to, they knew what type of battery I needed. Seriously, instead of a reminder email & text why couldn't I have gotten a message saying we don't have the battery yet, don't bother coming in. Why is the battery only being ordered now...AFTER I came in, not when I booked the appointment (Ya know, more than 3-5 business days ago).

The ""most innovative tech company"" can't even link their appointment schedule with the Apple stores? Not even like I was at a third party repair center, it was an official Apple store...

Never ever ever get AppleCare through Best Buy Total Tech,554,10mzzht,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10mzzht/never_ever_ever_get_applecare_through_best_buy/,170,"AppleCare + Best Buy=weeks of waiting

Do NOT get Best Buy Total Tech for your iPhone or, probably any apple product. These two companies need to acknowledge that the relationship isn’t working and it is at the customer’s expense. Honestly, Best Buy, he or she is not that into you, move on. And customers- neither is interested in you, you’re just in a custody battle.

On 1/3 I brought my beyond repairable iPhone into Best Buy for repair. I have Total Tech with Apple Care so it was fully covered. That all sounds good but what happens after is the most maddening b.s. 

1) The person I talked to at the Geeksquad counter looked at my phone, could see it is well beyond repair and said they could not take the phone in because I would need to make a Geeksquad appointment because they need to “run diagnostics to see if it is covered by Total Tech AppleCare”. It is. Is this something I can look up online on my account myself? He says, “Yes, you can do that.” This makes no sense then why an appointment is needed to determine that because if I can look it up (and I already had), why can’t the Geek Squad dude standing in Best Buy who has my account pulled up in his Best Buy computer not find this information himself? But I don’t want to make his life difficult because whatever they have going on for an inefficient system isn’t his fault. I ask if I can get in for that appointment that day or evening. No. It will be 3 days. Wait three days for them to look up my Apple Care. WTF. Ok, corporate bullshit has me waiting a few days.

2) 3 days later I make the time to drive back over there again with the same issue-need the phone replaced. The person at the counter this time is more helpful to the degree they can be. She is like, “I don’t know why they made you wait and make an appointment we can just do this right here.” She says she worked in the phone section but that they don’t cross train which leads to that stuff—As in being required to make an appointment to verify AppleCare coverage. And my Geeks Squad appointment says customer want to verify Apple Care coverage as my reason for the appointment. Um. NO, I DON’T, I want to move the repairs forward. I let her know that I appreciated her help and thought it seemed excessive to have to go in twice, 3 days apart just for that. She processed the phone, could see it is unrepairable and charged me for a replacement. She says it may be up to THREE WEEKS for them to replace. The phone but it does get overnight shipped both ways. Ok. So I have to use an old phone that does not get texts from almost numbers, that does not get data because my SIM is 5G and the phone is 4g. But, it’s temporary, it’ll be fine. It is, however, my work phone so I have to tell everybody that I do not get texts nor do I have data.

3) Days pass. Weeks pass. I go to AppleCare to find out what is going on. There is no record of a repair for my phone with them because they run it all through Best Buy and cut the customer out. You cannot talk to ANYONE at Apple because they have no record of your repairin their system. This leaves tracking a repair through Best Buy. When that happens it simply says, “We are moving forward with your repair’ or some unhelpful sentence like. No timeline, no deadline, no contact info. 

4) I am now 25 days in from the start of this. I decide to call the store to speak to a human. Instead it’s AI that tells me the phone attached to my number is currently in repair. OMG I KNOW THIS.  I say I want to talk to a person and AI tells me it “understands” I want to talk to someone and the wait will be 7 minutes. 5 minutes in someone answers. BUT it is clear I have been forwarded to a call center.  I explain what I want to know, they tell me they will see what is going on.  Hold. They return to tell me that my phone is being repaired.  That is so inadequate. I KNOW THIS. I want more accountability on that end- what is going on, give me a date, etc. He tells me I should call the store and would I like the number.. No- because that is where I called and got sent out to them.  

5) Today I go in to Best Buy again. They apologize and say they are unable to talk to any human being there and are only able to escalate the order and they say they have been doing it every other day and, will now, on day 24, start doing it daily. And they tell me this is typical of Apple with them.

DO NOT GET TOTALTECH for your Apple device. Pretty sure Apple deprioritizes their Best Buy work, Best Buy gets your Total Tech money so they don’t care as it is still profitable for them and you are out your device for weeks on end, with zero accountability on either company’s end.

Two things to know about me: 

1. I have been wanting 3 screens. Was really frustrated about the M2 MBA not supporting 2 externals. 
2. I have been trying to keep work / personal stuff separate 

Now I have a set up where the two laptops are mounted on either side of my monitor. I have 3 screens!! I also can control both personal and work with one set of mouse/keyboard which is great. 

Of course I still can't share windows across the machines, but I haven't found that to be much of an issue. I usually keep slack/spotify on one screen and do my work on the other two. 

I was pretty skeptical about universal control but I'm actually a pretty big fan of it. It works so much better than I thought it would.",1674847306.0
"Security keys, 2FA, account recovery testing",135,10mgr5l,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10mgr5l/security_keys_2fa_account_recovery_testing/,50,"I did some testing with and without security keys…

**Scenario**: 2FA enabled, Advanced Data Protection Enabled, Recovery Key set, 2 Recovery Contacts set  
   
Apple ID password reset - there are 3 options:  
1.	 You must HAVE unlocked trusted device AND must KNOW device passcode and then you can change password in settings (can be secured more by blocking Account changes with different pin) 
  

2.	You must KNOW a trusted phone number AND must HAVE unlocked trusted device to get pushed 6 digit code to reset remotely


3.	You must KNOW a trusted phone number AND must HAVE it to receive SMS verification code/call AND must KNOW your icloud recovery key
 

Logging in - there are two options:  
1.	Must KNOW password ; must HAVE unlocked trusted device
2.	Must KNOW password ; must HAVE working trusted phone number for SMS/Call
               


!!! Note I couldn't see a way to use Recovery Contacts.  Apple says having a Recovery Key set means Account Recovery is disabled, originally I thought this would just disable the manual Account Recovery that happens when you phone apple up about it - but it doesn't make it clear this means Recovery Contacts don't work. [edit] However the Recovery Key or Recovery Contacts are still very likely important for recovering end to end encryption keys for iCloud. 


___

 
**New scenario**: As above but with 2 Security Keys set as well  
 
  
Apple ID password reset - there is maybe 1 actual option:  
  
1.	You must HAVE an unlocked trusted device AND must KNOW device passcode to use settings menu to change password

2.	iforgot.apple.com - pushes a notification to your trusted devices which takes you to do #1 above...  or you can alternatively get instructions for #3. It does not apply 6 digit code etc. 

3.	Tells you to use Apple Support app etc.  When I try this currently it asks to confirm my phone number, and then takes me to a ""Security Key Verification - To reset your password, verify one of your security keys."" screen.  But this is immediately popped over with a ""Cannot verify identity - Your action could not be completed because of a server error. Try again."" message before I even have time to try to scan a key.  Maybe its suspicious because of all the fooling around I've been doing. This is where IMO it should allow you to HAVE the security key and KNOW the recovery key. 

4.	With the SAME factors as #1 you can also remove all the security keys from your account and remove the restrictions in place but this isn't really a separate option as its the same factors…
  
!!! So in this configuration, if correct, your account is GONE if a) you can't unlock a trusted device AND b) you forgot your icloud password. As above I don't feel this is correct - you should be able to HAVE a Security Key + KNOW the Recovery Key.  That said, this scenerio should be very rare?  And anybody who loses all their devices and forgets their icloud password is pretty unlikely to know their recovery key :P
  
!!!Your account is NOT lost if you lose all your security keys - see #4 above you can just delete them if you have the factors for #1  

The Recovery Key or Recovery contacts can’t seem to help you reset the password in this scenario, however they are still important to recover end to end encryption keys for iCloud data. 

  
Logging in there is only one option:  
                Must KNOW password ; must HAVE one of your security keys (or see #4 above)  
                (that said, I only tested this on icloud.com, didn't try logging in to a new device because pain but I suspect its the same...)
 
  
Google will let you have security keys plus other forms of two factor. However if you turn Google advanced protection on, then it also reverts to only allowing security keys as the second factor. But you can set a recovery contact that they warn will take several days to process.",1674811319.0

Anyone Else Very Disappointed with Freeform?,175,10m54zm,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10m54zm/anyone_else_very_disappointed_with_freeform/,82,"I was so incredibly excited for Freeform to launch because I love collaborating on projects with people for all types of things. It felt clunky to always be using different apps for different things, and I thought Freeform would be a great combination of other Apple apps (with functionality from Notes, Keynote, Numbers, etc.). 

BUT after spending this week tying to collaborate with my partner on a house we're building (layouts, floor plan, dimensions, lists, etc.) in Freeform, I find myself disappointed over how much is lacking. 

I'm hoping Apple adds a lot more power and functionality in the future. 

Primarily, I would love 

* the ability to change the dimensions of shapes (like one can do in Numbers, Keynote, Pages)
* change background color, grid, grid type, etc. 
* hold down hand-drawn lines / shapes and have them snap into the shape 
* snap hand drawn lines or shapes to the grid 
* be able to select more than just hand drawn lines 
* be able to select / move / scale / rotate / duplicate groups of objects 
* be able to lock objects 
* have an object tree sidebar 
* have settings or preferences

Heads up RE: Apple Studio Display,0,10l5n0z,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10l5n0z/heads_up_re_apple_studio_display/,10,"I just bought two Apple Studio displays. I ordered them with a Mac Studio Max and an M2 Air but the computers will arrive in a few weeks and the Studio Displays are here now. I am currently using an iMac 27"" from 2017. My iMac is connected to an OWC Thunderbay4 which holds four 6TB drives. That is chained to another Thunderbay4 with 4 backup  drives. The second Thunderbay is chained to an OWC dock to which I have two fast NVME ssd's for video editing. I connected my new Apple Studio Display to the iMac's second Thunderbolt port and booted it. It was a no go for the display. Studio Displays must be connected directly to the Mac and they have only one Tbolt port (and four USB-C Gen 2 ports).  It can't be chained. Previously my iMac had a different display connected to my OWC dock but the Apple display can't do that, nor could it boot if my other port on the imac was so heavily used. It turns out (an hour and a half with Apple techs that have sent the issue to the engineers) that - apparently - the Apple Display is power intensive (in spite of it's own power cord) and can't deal with the iMac's Thunderbolt setup. The iMac shares a single controller between the two Tbolt ports. I have learned if I boot my iMac with  the display connected to one thunderbolt on my iMac and then add just one Thunderbay and after that add the other Thunderbay with the attached dock, then it's all good and stable but the display will not turn on if I boot with everything attached.  My 16"" M1 Macbook Pro Max will deal with all of this attached at the same time so I am assuming the Mac Studio Max will also since the 4 Tbolts on the Studio  are independent.    Thought I'd clue folks in so since I mistakenly assumed my Studio displays could be easily connected like my previous Eizo display was. BTW...the complaints about the Studio Display's web cam were warranted. I'll be buying a decent web cam. Just horrible. Worse than my old iMac.",1674671124.0

I have some questions now that iOS 16.3 is out.

Is the Home architecture fixed? I can’t find any information that it is fixed, but I’m not good at finding all the information about iOS updates. Siri is still having problems with some questions and sometimes it’s quite laggy with the HomePod Mini. 

Is 16.2 the latest update on HomePod Mini? My HomePod Mini is on 16.2, and I can’t see any new updates on it. 
I heard that they would enable the humidity and temperature sensors in this update. Should I force update via my Mac?

I know there's probably a reason why they don't do that but I also find it odd whenever they release a product in a press release and not in one of there events. Or whenever certain products, like iPads, can either be released in either the first half or second half of the year instead of sticking to a specific release window.

Rap songs, low quality recordings, multi language conversations, everything seemed to work really well! Unfortunately the setup process required you to install a bunch of dependencies to then have to use Terminal for transcribing audio. Last week I made a very easy to use Mac app to solve this, MacWhisper!

Quickly and easily transcribe audio files into text with OpenAI's state-of-the-art transcription technology Whisper. Whether you're recording a meeting, lecture, or other important audio, MacWhisper quickly and accurately transcribes your audio files into text.

**Features**

* Easily record and transcribe audio files
* Just drag and drop audio files to get a transcription
* Get accurate text transcriptions in seconds (\~15x realtime)
* Search the entire transcript and highlight words
* Supports multiple languages (fastest model is English only)
* Copy the entire transcript or individual sections
* Supports Tiny (English only), Base and Large models
* Reader Mode
* Edit and delete segments from the transcript
* Select transcription language (or use auto detect)
* Supported formats: mp3, wav, m4a and mp4 videos.
* .srt & .vtt export

**Which version do you need?**

You can download MacWhisper or MacWhisper Pro. MacWhisper Pro includes the Large model which offers the best transcription available right now and has industry leading accuracy but takes a lot longer to generate. The regular version of MacWhisper uses the Tiny (English only) and Base models, which are still very accurate and fast. Depending on your usecase you might want to use the Pro version. You can always change what version you want later.

Gumroad has a 250MB file size limit for apps that are listed for free so I had to make that part paid. Select **MacWhisper Pro** from the sidebar and pay 6 or more to get it.

A lesson learned. Avoid buying any secondhand Airpods.,4,10jzjxq,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10jzjxq/a_lesson_learned_avoid_buying_any_secondhand/,86,"To start, I will say I'm very tech savvy. Today I went to buy some Airpods pro gen 2 that i found listed on offer up BNIB. I stressed to the seller that I wanted to verify the authenticity before I handed over the money. Trust me when I say, these are the best fakes I have ever seen. I checked the serial number on the apple coverage website and it was all green. I connected them to my phone and all the settings that should pop up were there. Every single serial number matched; the box, the case, the individual airpods, and even in the settings app. They even had applecare+ until 2025. These things had me fooled for a solid 4 hours, until I turned on transparency mode. I could tell something was off. I went to the apple store and 3 techs were stumped with the authenticity since it even registered on their diagnostics tools and showed a valid SN. The main tell was the font was ever so slightly off on the inside of the lid and the weight of the counterfeit pods were slightly lighter than authentic. Moral of the story, do not buy airpods on third party marketplaces unless the seller is willing you meet you at apple and let a tech or two take a look at them.

TLDR: Fake Airpods are getting almost indistinguishable from the real thing. If buying secondhand or from a third party marketplace, do not trust anyone not willing to meet you at an apple store.


EDIT: I remember why I unsubscribed from this god awful high and mighty sub. Acting like y’all never made a mistake, awful people. I can also guarantee I’m more tech literate than any of you negative commenters. I 3d modeled and constructed a dual pc system inside a custom built desk. I’ve built my own 3d printer. I install all my own tech, including a wireless CarPlay unit. I’ve wired and built my own digital soldering iron. I run my own home media plex server that also doubles as a ubiquiti home security server. Fuck all y’all “I guess the bar for tech savvy is low these days”

Netflix is missing quite a few features on Apple TV,69,10j31ga,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10j31ga/netflix_is_missing_quite_a_few_features_on_apple/,54,"Title, I'm sure I can't be the only one who's noticed this.

\- No way to remove from Continue Watching

\- A way to remote control? This is possible across every other TV device I use and isn't limited to Google Cast, as Xbox & Playstation both show in the ""Casting"" menu (Likely using Netflix Remote Control)

I understand these may be minor features, but the fact that even the UI looks super dated compared to the other platforms just raises so many questions for me. You're paying the same price as everyone else, and being punished for choosing to use the service on the Apple TV.

"Dropbox forcing ""Files On-Demand"" cloud storage instead of local storage",108,10hujl3,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10hujl3/dropbox_forcing_files_ondemand_cloud_storage/,54,"I use Dropbox to sync my files between a few devices. Notably, I want all of the files to remain on all of the devices.

This weekend, I was presented with a message from my Dropbox client that it wants to move all of my locally stored files from ~/Dropbox to ~/Library/CloudStorage. This is a huge pain in the ass, as it will require updating about a hundred configuration files to point to the new path.

Much more disturbing, the new Dropbox client indicates that all files will be marked as ""On-Demand,"" *i.e.*, potentially not living on my devices but only in Dropbox. This is alarming, since many of my workflows expect files to be available locally and to be immediately available, rather than waiting to be downloaded from Dropbox. It also raises the ugly prospect of discovering that needed files are inaccessible when I'm offline, and being unable to access them (or, at least, without a lengthy delay).

Some research revealed [this article from Microsoft last year](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-disk-space-with-onedrive-files-on-demand-for-mac-529f6d53-e572-4922-a585-e7a318c135f0#:~:text=OneDrive%20Files%20On%2DDemand%20helps,new%20information%20about%20each%20file.) regarding similar changes in OneDrive, and, further, that these changes appear to have been prompted by Apple deprecating some kexts that OneDrive had used for syncing cloud storage files. I also found [this MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/01/onedrive-mac-users-unhappy-files-on-demand/) suggesting that OneDrive users hate this change and find it to be buggy.

I'm extremely irritated by this change, as **I never have and never will rely on on-demand cloud storage for these files**. These files are core to my daily digital life and I expect them to be available all the time on every device and kept fully in sync. I have plenty of local storage space for these files and I am accustomed to managing all of it. So these changes, which not only break current workflows but might introduce new and persistent headaches, are motivated by features that aren't even relevant to me.

I am so deeply irritated by this bullshit that I am now looking at other cloud storage providers that won't engage in this kind of behavior. If I have to blow an entire weekend reconfiguring my machines due to the ghoulish demands of Dropbox, I may as well switch to a provider that is actually sensitive to users' needs.

Recommendations are welcome.",1674317114.0

Let’s take Siri for example. People have been sharing their experiences and feedback for years yet the product is generally not much better than it was on release. Sure it received a more fluid voice. But as far as its functionality it’s highly inaccurate. 

Having to tell Siri to go away every time it’s used is simply unintuitive. The phrases it uses are immature at best. For example it will say “Uhh hu?” if you don’t speak fast enough. What in the California!?

Siri is has become the substandard of Virtual Assistants. Even pop culture continually rags on it.

Apple seems to care so little that it’s not even listed on the Product Feedback page.

A couple days ago my phone (iPhone 12 mini) stopped being able to connect with Wi-Fi. Add to that cell towers in my area going down, my phone had no way to connect with the outside world. Using my partners phone, I called Apple Care to try and diagnose the issue. The rep’s first suggestion was to reset and reinstall the iOS. I asked multiple times if this would wipe my phone. I would have to back it up properly first if so, as I can’t lose valuable information on there. 

She emphatically said multiple times it would not. Lo and behold, it did. As soon as I mentioned this, and was quite unhappy as we had directly discussed this, she stopped speaking. The line was open, I could hear ambient noise for about 3 minutes, then she hung up. I later found out she made no notes on the case either. 

Just today, I had to call again about an issue with some Apple software on my computer. It’s my primary work software, and the issue I was dealing with is very complex. After spending about 30 minutes on the phone with support, realizing we were going in circles and he wasn’t going to be able to help, I asked to speak with a supervisor or someone who might have more knowledge on such a niche (but very important) issue. 

Similar to the first call, he went silent for a couple minutes, then hung up. I again found out in a subsequent call he didn’t take any notes about the call.

Siri on Apple TV vs iOS,1,10i6zz8,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10i6zz8/siri_on_apple_tv_vs_ios/,2,"I’ve been seeing so many “is Siri getting dumber” posts. I agree that this is a concern, a big time one as many use digital assistants for the day to day. I am wondering if, at least partially, it’s because Apple tries to keep a large amount of its operations on the phone itself as opposed to using the cloud exclusively, as well as not getting as much analytical data from users to improve the system. 

I know Apple was caught a while back listening and keeping peoples audio without their consent, and I’m wondering if they were trying to get more data to improve Siri, much like maybe Alexa and Google do/did?

Has anyone else realized that Siri on Apple TV is faster and much better than on the iPhone, at least for me? It’s actually a pleasure to use the Siri Remote compared to Siri on the iPhone. I wonder if the Apple TV actually uses customer data to improve Siri (at least for Apple TV). I can’t speak to the HomePod because I have not yet used one.

Anyone agree with this at some level? Or do you have any other things to add to this topic?",1674349504.0

Then I get the ""revised value"" and it's $55 not $160.  No way I'm taking that, but they will send the phone back to me no charge.

Here's where it gets ""dark"" though.  I *accidentally* clicked the ""Accept"" button instead of ""Reject"".  There is no ""are you sure?"" confirmation.  Just ""Thank you, you've accepted the offer"".   No recourse, nothing.

I *immediately* went to Support.  Online customer service can't help, but they take all my information and suggest I try the phone support line.  The phone support person is very nice, but even they CANNOT REVERSE THE PROCESS.

I brought the defective MagSafe Duo with me to exchange, having checked to confirm the store had stock. I did not mean to give the impression that I drove there *only* to exchange the MagSafe Duo. I did not do my homework. No excuses for that. In my weak defence, I've never had to do homework on Apple's processes before because they are typically so slick and seamless. I was just surprised I could not simply exchange the defective item for in-store stock, something that I would take for granted at Best Buy, Home Depot, or in a purely online environment, Amazon.

Edit 2: Sounds like there may have been a break down in the process at the Apple store. Other people have reported different experiences in similar circumstances. E.g., they should have agreed to mail the device to me.

Mini-rant. Drove the \~2 hours to my nearest Apple store to exchange my MagSafe Duo charger, the phone-side charger of which stopped working a couple weeks ago. The unit was still under warranty. Despite a dozen or so MagSafe chargers SITTING RIGHT THERE ON THE SHELF they could not give me one.

Apple ID Issues,20,10g74bh,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10g74bh/apple_id_issues/,27,"Hi all, very long post, TL;DR at bottom. 

On November 24th of 2022 I was sitting down with my family to watch the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving Special on AppleTV. I logged into Apple TV in browser on my windows machine (which is hooked up to the “TV”). It said I’d receive a prompt to authenticate with my iPhone. 

On my iPhone I received a prompt that someone in <a major city within a (long) days drive of me> was trying to access my account. Now, I know these things don’t always tell you the city you actually live in, especially when it’s actually pretty rural, so I assumed this was myself and hit Accept. It then gave me a 6 digit pin to put in on Apple TV website, which I did, and we watched the show. 

Later that evening I found out while checking my email that my Apple ID password had been reset. I realized I may have accidentally authenticated someone that wasn’t supposed to have access to the account, so I quickly attempted to reset my password thru the Settings app on my iPhone. I was told my Apple ID was locked for security reasons, and to visit iForgot.Apple.com to reset the password. 

On this website it asked for my Apple ID email and associated phone number, which I provided. Fortunately, it seems the phone number hadn’t yet been changed because it seemed to work. I was told I’d receive a text in 24 hours to reset my password.  I was like “ok that’s not ideal, but I can work with that. I’d rather not loose my account.”

Now, for background reference, I am a student right now. I do have a part time job that pays ok, but the economy has been real shitty lately, so I have taken up DoorDash and Uber to try to keep putting money into savings for my future. 

Aside from the aforementioned windows machine, my only other devices are an old MacBook Pro, and an iPad Mini (I believe 2nd generation but I don’t know for sure, it was a gift). I require both of these devices to do my schoolwork. 

Anyways, back to iForgot, after the 24 hour waiting period, I didn’t receive any text or email or anything, but I went back to the website and they told me I’d need to wait something like 2 weeks (13 days or so) to reset my password. At this point I was miffed. My income and my grades were dependent on having my devices functioning, but given the point in the semester I sucked it up and said “ok, fine. Small price to pay for not loosing my accounts right? I’ll just not by any more Christmas presents, and work out some plea deals with my professors.” 

A couple days into this two week period, I log into IForgot to check the status, and it says I can reset my password on my Mac. I’m thinking this is great, way faster than the 2 weeks I was expecting. I open up my MacBook and wait for the notification to pop up. It never does. I try running the iForgot steps again (account email, phone number, etc) and still nothing on my Mac. The iForgot website says I should be receiving a notification, but it never arrives. 

I tried again to tell it I needed to reset my password and it threw me into another 24 hour waiting period. I waited thru this period, where I was told I’d receive a message after 24 hours to reset my password. No such message arrived, and logging into iForgot again, it told me I needed to wait another two weeks.  I should also add that on this screen it says that “Apple Support cannot shorten the wait time.” So now I’m pretty frustrated, but I don’t see what else I can do but wait. 

Guess what? A couple days later iForgot has the same message about resetting my password on my Mac, and repeats the above, I log in, receive no notifications, and the iForgot countdown timer is gone again. 

So I call up Apple Support at this point because clearly something is going wrong. The first tech I speak with tells me that I need to shut down and leave powered down any devices except the one I want to reset the password with. Now I will note, NOWHERE on the iForgot website does it tell you this, but according to the tech support guy, if the system sees my other devices logged in, it’ll kick me out of the reset process. 

He has me try a couple other methods of reset on each of my devices, none of them working or course. At the end he tells me I’m just gonna have to wait for the password reset program on iForgot to run its course. He closes my ticket and, a couple days later (after finals and stuff) I attempt, again, to reset my password. 

This time I turned off all my Apple Devices, save my phone, which the Apple Support Tech *assured* me was allowed to stay on. 

At this point I think you can guess how this went. 24 hour waiting period with the promise of a text or email. No such text or email. 2 week waiting period, which after a couple days, tells me to use my Mac to reset the password, I try, but never receive any notification on my Mac. 

At this point I’m into Christmas break, and have had no access to my account for nearly a month. I called Apple Support again, and was asked to try basically all of the above again. Then they passed me up the chain to a “Senior Support Tech” or something like that. This woman, I forget her name, was very kind and understanding, but not at all helpful. She asked me to walk her through everything we tried, and had me try a couple other things (like resetting thru a friends iPhone using the Apple Support App) all to no avail. After several hours on the phone, she tells me it could be an issue with the iForgot security system, but to figure out what it could be we’d need to run another attempt at password reset with the iForgot system. She tells me that I may not receive anything at 24 hours, even tho I should, but to check it every day, and to use an emailed hyperlink to get in touch with her as soon as I notice the iForgot system has kicked me out of the reset process. 

So we start the process again, and low and behold, 24 hours, no notifications, two weeks hold, and a couple days in it tells me to use my Mac to reset (the Mac that has been powered off for nearly two weeks at this point, along with my iPad).  As soon as this happens, I open up my email to get in touch with the senior support lady, and lo and behold, the hyperlink she gave me to get in contact requires me to log in with my Apple ID to function. The Apple ID that is currently locked for security reasons. 

So seeing no other option, I called back apple support *again* and was put thru all the above paces again, was handed off to a new senior support guy named something like Dave or David or something, and he tells me all the same things, has me try all the same things as Nice Support Staff Lady, although he’s very grouchy the entire time. 

I think you can guess at this point. 24 Hours. Two Weeks. A couple days later I’m booted from the reset. Dave only provided the email link that requires Apple ID to get in touch. I call Apple Support again, walk the first guy through it again, and am passed up the chain again, this time to a guy named Ralph or something like that. 

I should also interject here, that during this entire time I have not been able to do most of the work I normally do to bring in my income, because DoorDash and Uber have had app updates that are required, but I cannot update, because my Apple ID is locked. So not only am I out my account, and all of its purchases, I’m also out one of my primary income streams now too, and at this point it’s after Christmas. I have been locked out for over a month and unable to do anything about it. 

Ralph tells me that it’s possible there is some other problem going on that is unforeseen. He asks me to try the iForgot process again, and to let him know when it kicks me out again. And THANK GOD when I bring up that the hyperlink apple support thing won’t work because my Apple ID is locked, he says, “Oh good point, I’ll give you an email you can respond to via email, as well as my office hours.” 

Over New Year’s Eve weekend, we try again, 24 hours, two weeks, kicked out, I send him an email, wait a couple days and get a call. He tells me that it’s possible there’s some other devices out there that are logged in with my Apple ID that are booting me from the process. I think about it for a while and am fairly certain that I’ve done my due diligence and that none of my friends or family had my Apple ID logged in. 

He says it can even be things I wouldn’t think about like a watch or Apple TV. I hadn’t thought of the Apple TV before, but my parents (who live two times zones away) have an Apple TV. Ralph says he’s going to escalate my case to the Apple Engineers to hopefully get this sorted out. 

I call my mom, she double checks the Apple TV, and I am not logged in on it. Haven’t been for “months or years” according to her. My dad verifies as well a few days later. I let Ralph know this by email, he says thanks and that he’s still waiting to hear from the engineers. A couple days go by and what I get back from Ralph and the engineers is basically, “Oh yeah it looks like one of your devices was still active and is getting you kicked out, but for security reasons we can’t tell you which one. Better double check them all and try again.” 

At this point by the tone of, and increasing time between, Ralph’s emails I can tell he is getting exasperated by me and or my case. I am also pretty much hopeless at this point. I have had my iPad and MacBook powered off all year, all my friends and family have confirmed not a single device is logged in with my Apple ID, which should leave just my 3: iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro. The last two of which *have been off all year*. 

Ralph has me try the iForgot system again (resetting thru the Settings app on my phone), and as I am sure you know to expect at this point: 24 hours. Two weeks. Use your Mac. No notifications. Booted out of the system again. 

At some point in the last 2 ish weeks I asked Ralph what would happen if someone had compromised the account and actually gotten a device logged in and set up with my ID. He said, in a nutshell, “well that would suck, you’d have to wait for them to stop using your Apple ID. Cuz any time you try the reset process, If anyone is using or even has powered on a device with your Apple ID logged in on it, it’s going to kick you out of the reset process. Which is unfortunate, but there is nothing I can do about that.” 

The last I heard from Ralph at this point is the message about my devices “not all being logged off and I should please double check” (they have all been off since before new years). That email was a week ago and I’m beginning to wonder if there’s nothing that can be done for my account. 

I am nearing the 2 month mark since this whole ordeal began, and I’m pretty hopeless. I have had to take extra shifts at work to make up some of the lost income from not being able to Dash and Uber, and I haven’t had access to any of my music or movies that I had spent years accumulating. Apple Support has been completely unhelpful. I don’t know what to do at this point. 

Is there anyone who’s experienced similar issues? Is there any way for me to ever get my account back? I’d take any and all suggestions at this point. 

Thanks for your time. 

TL;DR, Apple ID was probably compromised back in November and the password reset has been failing for 2 months straight. Apple Support has been completely useless and not helped anything.",1674148230.0

Are there any actual uses for Neural Engine on the desktop,9,10fiyx5,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10fiyx5/are_there_any_actual_uses_for_neural_engine_on/,2,"Apple first designed their own silicon for their phones. Now they are putting these chips in all their devices.

They promote their “Neural Engine” in every product launch but… is that part of the CPU ACTUALLY USED for anything on the desktop?

There was a thread on this topic a year ago. It was basically a list of things it COULD BE used for, mentions of Photoshop/FinalCut and references to faceID on phones.

As a desktop user, this feature seems like potential more than product. A larger GPU seems more useful for me personally but Im curious if I am missing something that has actually been implemented.

If there are no uses, I wish they would stop talking about it. If they are going to promote it so much, they ought to better explain what it actually does.

Ive seen some comments on using these cores for ML projects but Ive heard that the ML libraries for MacOS are way behind other platforms which use GPU’s or dedicated AI hardware. This is probably a different discussion. Normal consumers are not running ML models on their iMac.",1674077687.0

Connecting while in call is a nightmare. I thought perhaps I was a bit unlucky, as googling this problem didn't provide much valuable information.

But my friend moved from Android to iOS one month ago and he complained about bluetooth connectivity constantly failing on him. 

I feel this is particularly bad given that the airpods should be seamlessly integrated with the Apple devices, yet these too fail in rapidly connecting to it's host device.

There are other ways to make playlists too:

**Images** \- Upload a picture of a music festival poster (or other image with artist names on it) and it uses Apple's image recognition to create a playlist of the artists in the image

**Videos** \- Upload a video, like a TikTok, that has multiple songs in it and it uses Shazam to collect the songs into a playlist.

In the future I plan on making more ways to create playlists and refining the AI. This is a 1.0 release of the AI, it isn't perfect, but it generally does pretty well.

It also actually looks good on my wrist. Recently i learned that the Apple Watch Edition was discontinued in favor of the Apple Watch ultra. I was actually pretty pissed considering that I don’t need everything that the ultra has to offer, but yet if i want to upgrade in the future I actually will have to chose between the ultra or the stainless steel. Better yet it appears too big for my wrist.

For those who owned/owns an Apple Watch Edition. What would be your plan should time come that you would be due for a upgrade? 

Go back to traditional watches? Get the ultra? Downgrade to Stainless Steel version? Or go watch less?

PDFgear for Mac - An Easy and Free PDF Program,54,10cy7aq,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10cy7aq/pdfgear_for_mac_an_easy_and_free_pdf_program/,35,"Hi everyone. I’m Gordon, the developer of [PDFgear](https://www.pdfgear.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post20230116), which could handle PDFs with easier operations on Mac for free. I’ve tried most of the popular PDF programs on the market and found that either the prices are too high, the interfaces are too complicated to use, or converters not supported. So I started to create my own project to process PDF documents, and here PDFgear comes. 

PDFgear is an easy and free program, and most of the functions needed in PDFs are included:

* View PDFs for sure
* Annotate PDFs with highlight, underline, and strikethrough with customized color
* Write or draw on PDFs freely
* Insert shapes at the place you want
* Add notes and text boxes
* Fill out forms with complete tools, including text insert, checkmark, cross mark, radio button
* Sign and stamp PDFs easily
* Insert, extract, delete, crop, and rotate pages in easy steps
* Convert PDF to Word, Excel, PNG, JPEG, RTF, TXT HTML, and XML with OCR! for totally free!
* Convert Word, Excel, PPT, Image, RTF, and TXT to PDF in seconds! Also for totally free!
* Merge, split, and compress PDFs, batch supported!

You could download [PDFgear](https://www.pdfgear.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post20230116) here.

As a free program, some users might be interested in how to make money with PDFgear. Intending to bring PDFgear to more users and help handle PDFs easier, monetization is off the table for now. As for the future, some of the advanced features might be charged. But that’s just a hypothetical consideration, and I’m focusing on developing PDFgear as a better solution for PDF processing at the current stage. So I wish to get your feedback no matter it is a suggestion or a compliment!

Thanks in advance!",1673824590.0
"Refurb Mac Studio ""lost"" in transit to Apple Store - Where/how do I escalate this?",60,10cpe5r,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10cpe5r/refurb_mac_studio_lost_in_transit_to_apple_store/,49,"TL;DR - UPS has a proof of delivery of a refurb Mac Studio to an Apple Store, Apple Store says they don't have it. I'm feeling stuck between the finger-pointing (Apple says file a claim with UPS), and need suggestions on how to escalate as I simply want the Mac Studio I ordered. What should I do now?

**Update**
* First thank you to everyone who replied! Today the unit was found somewhere in/about/near the retail store. 
* I had escalated on both fronts including a claim with UPS that rejected it with ""contact sender first and create a SEM case"" + Apple Number
* The retail store implied the problem occurred because I ""changed my ship-to address to that the retail store"" which was certainly not the case - I just selected the ship-to-store option/process. That said, my name appeared above ""Apple Pacific Centre"" in the shipping address, but I have no idea why they fumbled/lost it. 
* I suspect the fact this unit was a refurbishment and shipped from Elk Grove California it may have gotten some manual attention. Through this journey I've learned more of the process than I cared for, but do want to send my appreciation to Ryan at the Vancouver retail store for being kind/professional and helpful throughout.

----------
Details:
I ordered a Mac Studio refurb G14K6LL and chose “in-store pickup” to be safe. A day later I received an invoice/shipped notice and my CC was charged - all seemed well. 

Late the day of supposed pick-up (Friday 13th), I called Apple and was told ""it's at the store"" and noted that I've not received a pickup notice. They transferred me to the store and was told ""no we don't have it in the POS, but call back tomorrow after 10am"". 

I followed-up late the following day via the same process, and this time the call centre shared the UPS tracking # and proof of delivery to the store. Was transferred to the store again who with the S/N ""went line-by-line"" by their delivery manifest"" to confirm the didn't have it. 

The Apple Store suggested ""I file a claim with UPS"", but is it really my responsibility to do so? I just want my Mac Studio. I see where this headed - a long investigation and dispute; and I wondered if someone could share further ideas that may help.

"Apple, it's time to make sync smarter.",25,10cv7y9,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10cv7y9/apple_its_time_to_make_sync_smarter/,6,"There have been many attempts over the years to reduce network load, from MacOS Server caching updates for iOS devices, through to iTunes Sync over Wifi. But now with many iCloud Sync, Apple don't appear to have made any attempts at making this ""smarter"".

Depending on your sync goals, there's one glaring flaw with using a portable device on battery to record content that is cloud synced, it inevitably pauses sync until the device is plugged in, whether you're out on the street, or at home, it won't matter. And it's during this time that if something goes wrong with the device the content is lost.

Isn't it about time that Sync was introduced as a service on all devices/OS' so that when a device is on battery, but on the same network as another device (which is configured to sync the same content), it will then regardless of corded state, sync that new content to the other device via Bluetooth/Wifi (as appropriate). This serves to ensure that content is securely recorded in at least two locations, it reduces internet bandwidth/load, and is much more timely than double hopping all the devices up to the cloud and back down. The development logistics would be somewhat less complicated than developing an entirely new system beyond introducing ""receive"" sync capabilities on OS' ... from there they can either use network discovery, or a cloud based public/private IP matching system (that is, when a device contacts the sync server, it records the public IP, and if the private IP subnet matches with another device, then Sync is directed to the local device and not the internet).

The ultimate goal is to make sync more timely and more reliable using the local network where possible to ensure content is in multiple locations, especially if one of those locations is a corded device (e.g. iMac, etc).

Now, if this is meant to be already implemented and working, then I have absolutely no idea of determining if it's working or not because I have many gigs worth of video on my phone sitting on the desk next to my iMac with sync paused because ""reasons"" ...",1673817391.0
🌪️ Introducing Tornado S3 Sync,57,10cnxl1,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10cnxl1/introducing_tornado_s3_sync/,20,"👋 Howdy, folks! I hope everyone is having an excellent Sunday. Recently, I released [Tornado S3 Sync](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344) for MacOS Ventura.

[You can download it here!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344)

A couple of months ago I faced a problem:

**I needed a way to reliably sync the local files on my MacBook to my personal Amazon S3 Bucket.**

I tried other solutions but they were all either too bloated with other file transfer protocols (SFTP, SCP, etc.), had ambiguous at best data collection policies, or had such a gnarly configuration UI that the thought of ever having to go back into those settings menus sent me running for the hills. All I wanted was an easy to use and configure menubar app to sync my files.

This was the genesis for my first ever MacOS app, [**Tornado S3 Sync**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tornado-s3-sync/id6444950344).

Built entirely in SwiftUI, Tornado S3 Sync offers users a simple way to reliably backup your Mac's files to your personal Amazon S3 Bucket. Below are some of the features that Tornado S3 Sync offers:

* **Secure syncs** - Tornado S3 Sync makes secure API calls to Amazon's published S3 REST APIs
* **Observability** - Tornado S3 Sync can notify you of in progress, successful, or failed S3 sync actions
* **Set and forget** - Once you've configured Tornado S3 Sync to your liking, you can have peace of mind knowing that your files are syncing on the interval of your choosing
* **Absolutely zero data collection** - Tornado S3 Sync **does not** collect any data about you, your local client, or anything that you send to Amazon.
* **No in-app purchases or subscriptions** - I hate subscriptions as much as anyone, which is why Tornado S3 Sync is a one-time purchase with no in-app purchases or subscriptions.

And that's it! Tornado S3 Sync is exceptionally uncomplicated, and is, in my very biased opinion, the easiest way to get your files backed up from your Mac to your Amazon S3 Bucket.

As an added bonus, I have 10 promo codes to give away to the first 10 users that DM me!

Thank you all, and happy syncing!",1673800087.0

Clipboard changes all of this. I designed it to have a user experience light years ahead of `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` so that any user could get started right away. Additionally, you can actually copy real, honest-to-goodness files now instead of just text! Best of all, the Clipboard app is free and open-source.

Getting rid of the AirPort line seems pretty dumb in retrospect,189,10bw7g2,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10bw7g2/getting_rid_of_the_airport_line_seems_pretty_dumb/,44,"I was never really an AirPort superfan, but I did like it. When it was discontinued I moved on. Looking back on it though, I really think this was a dumb discontinuation on Apple's part. There are a lot of examples of beloved and discontinued products whose fans continue to miss them long after they're gone (think Google Reader). In a lot of these cases, the product in question had a really strong use case for a certain set, but was not economically viable for the business to maintain or make money off of.

But for Apple, and their set of Home devices (not to mention HomeKit), just seems like a big misstep to lose this critical part of people's home networks.

\- AirPort could easily tie into Apple's messaging about privacy and include privacy features that are easy to activate and use.

\- AirPort could act as a Home Hub for people who don't have an Apple TV, or other product. 

\- AirPort could act as a ""HomeKit Router"" instead of having to rely exclusively on third party products.

\- AirPort brand and/or technology could be (if Apple wanted), integrated into other products. I.e., maybe you can have a HomePod that also has an AirPort router built in, or MacMini with router capabilities. (Not saying they should have done this, but they could have had the option).

\- Apple could have done this with an existing product line, that they wouldn't have had to build from scratch. It was already there, people already liked it. Maybe it wouldn't be a huge profit driver but certainly supports the ecosystem at home. 

\- Ongoing support for features like Time Machine backup.

While I'm not saying that any one of these ideas would have been a great use case (I'm not an Apple Engineer), I am saying that there would be plenty of opportunities for innovation with an Apple router in people's homes.

At the time AirPort was discontinued, it was kind of at the nadir of Apple's hardware development (in my opinion). Butterfly keyboards, limited ports, etc. But Apple has largely been able to recover/adjust course on those missteps. 

The AirPort line seems like another story entirely. Just a huge mistake and missed opportunity for Apple to support a key component of people's home internet. Not a great move, and I think their home strategy is suffering as a result.",1673722553.0

Ulti-Planner Calendar for iOS is now released. We think we have a best-in-class contender for your scheduling needs.,13,10ccmh9,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10ccmh9/ultiplanner_calendar_for_ios_is_now_released_we/,23," 

Hey [r/apple](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/)

Just wanted to let people know about our new app. With over 1200 new development hours and over 3 years in beta, we have taken our older best selling app's code base and completely rewritten it to be faster, cleaner, lightweight and more reliable to create a new experience on iPhone and iPad. This may be one of the most mature and full featured version 1.0 apps you will ever find.

The app features 8 calendar views with a ton of customizations and a new card based UI. Other features include calendar text, drag-n-drop, advanced reminders, weather, custom view filters, icons, hashtags, and embedded event lists ... And a few more are cut-n-paste, templates, meeting handling, natural language, and widgets. And...

I think you'll love just how customizable the app is. No more living with a 'red' calendar with a bunch of dots. You can customize the app in a bunch of colors in both light and dark mode, or change to a completely different solid color. And the month view alone has 8 different formats to choose from including text, icons, time bars, or dots.

So please give it a try and see if it can replace your calendar. The basic free version is what a lot of people want, a simple month calendar with calendar text and widgets. And then premium adds all of the advanced views including a new timeline day view along with reminders, weather, icons, hashtags, and quick entry options. You can try that out for 14 days before deciding and our price point is way below similar apps.

Thank you!

I've spent the last couple of years making my first app called Who Said That?. It is a mobile game to play with your friends where you ask each other questions, receive the answers anonymously then try to figure out whose answer is whose. 

It's a game of double bluffs and second-guessing as you trick your friends into thinking your answer is someone else's. There are also bonus points for the best answer so you want to write something good!

In addition, you can add Alan BOT to your games, an AI player that uses the latest ChatGPT API to answer your questions and give an answer. Will Alan fool you into thinking he's one of your friends or even swipe the bonus points for the best answer? 

Finally, there's also a single-player mode where you can choose an answer to ask Alan and see if you can guess which answer is his and which is from a real human. 

It's free to play so hopefully you'll love to try it and give any feedback at all.

Expense - app for tracking expenses,20,11item9,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11item9/expense_app_for_tracking_expenses/,21,"App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expense-control-your-budget/id1669548999?platform=iphone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expense-control-your-budget/id1669548999?platform=iphone)  
Hi, recently I released my new app - Expense, it is a simply designed app that helps to track your expenses and remain within your budget boundaries.

The basic idea is that you create a budget and set a specific amount of money you want to spend per month. As you add expenses, the total amount will decrease, and you will be able to track three main values: your monthly budget, the amount you've spent, and the remaining balance for the current month. The values reset at the beginning of each new month (week/day, based on the selected time range), but the history of the previous time ranges is available.

The app also allows you to switch between different time ranges, such as week or day, by dividing your monthly budget by the number of weeks or days in that period. This feature allows you to see the same data, but for a shorter time frame, helping you understand if you're staying within your weekly or daily budget, which in turn helps you avoid exceeding your monthly budget in the future.

To make things more visual, the app provides charts that make it easier to identify trends and patterns in your spending habits and helps you make more informed decisions about your budget going forward.

Also, a few main advantages over other similar apps:  
\- easy to use / simple UI- data is synchronized on all your devices  
\- the ability to share and manage your budget with other people  
\- recurring expenses, you can add repeating payments  


Would like to hear your feedback, thank you :)",1678010447.0

After an in-app purchase didn't work, the vendor recommended that I'd get in touch with Apple for a refund.

You’re not getting a reason as to why they refuse the refund. You also don’t get to state your case. It’s complete bs.

I contacted my bank, who had their legal department review the case. They concluded that I was entitled to a chargeback. They then contacted my card provider, who again had their legal department review the case and conclude that Apple was wrong in withholding the refund. 

Apple then blocked my app store account without telling me, resulting in me not being able to update apps and close security vulnerabilities. After I got in touch with Apple support, they re-enabled my account.

My card, however, remains blocked; I can’t use it anymore in the App Store or with Apple Pay. Apple support isn't interested in the case. When I raise this issue in the community the posts get removed.


My learnings from this case:

1.	Avoid Apple in-app purchases wherever possible because Apple doesn't like accountability
2.	Use a throw-away card that I don't use anywhere else on Apple so that it quickly can be replaced.",1677816751.0

"Stolen MacBook delivery, filed a police report but Apples says I’m on my own",262,11g7ryb,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11g7ryb/stolen_macbook_delivery_filed_a_police_report_but/,283,"**”Good” news: see bottom**

I ordered a MacBook Pro this Monday and I expected the delivery to arrive on Wednesday. Indeed the MacBook was _listed_ as delivered by both Apple and FedEx (the courier) but it never arrived at my apartment. Looking at the FedEx proof of delivery, it turned out that **it was signed for by a complete stranger** with no affiliation with myself or the apartment!

So I contacted both Apple and FedEx, and at Apple’s recommendation I filed a police report with the Baltimore Police Department. I called Apple again this morning in order to update them that I filed the report, and I was prepared them to give them the case number, but they said it was BPD that had to inform Apple, not me.

So then I called BPD asking if they’d inform Apple, and they said no, and I will have to forward the police report to Apple myself. I then called Apple _again_ and this time they said it was completely out of their hands, and that it was now the responsibility of local law enforcement to resolve the case. But knowing BPD…yeah good luck with that.

So now I'm $2000 in the hole and at this point the only thing I can think of that'll get me back that money is to call my credit card company to do a chargeback (or at least call Apple again to threaten one). I've seen that that's a way to get your Apple ID locked, but if that's the way a trillion-dollar corporation is willing to do with regards to their deliveries, perhaps it is worth it to be excommunicated from the walled garden.

I hope that this post highlights these sorts of issues with Apple, given that I am not the only person who has faced them (just search up ""stolen deliveries"" on this sub or on other Apple forums).

**Update (3/3/2023)**

The leasing office updated me about what they saw on the surveillance footage. At the time of the supposed delivery, there was no delivery personnel (FedEx or otherwise) going through the entrance.

I called FedEx in order to update my case with this information, as well as provide them with my leasing offices’ contact information. I also called BPD in order to let the office submit the footage as evidence in the police report.

**Update 2 (3/3/2023)**

The leasing office contacted me again a few hours after the previous update saying that a shipment to my name had arrived. And indeed, it was my MacBook - the tracking number and the serial number matched up, and the laptop had arrived in working condition. ~~I’ll still have to update FedEx and BPD about this resolution.~~ Updated both of them to close their cases.

That said, **this whole experience remains completely unacceptable.** Most egregiously, FedEx should not have let a complete rando sign on my behalf, then mark the package as delivered when it wouldn’t actually arrive for another two days. And Apple should not have been so hostile to the customer when the delivery of their item has failed.

Ultimately I expected a far better experience from a company that markets itself as a premium brand, and I had to waste two and a half days dealing with and worrying about delivery shenanigans and potentially having to initiate  chargebacks or legal action. Plus it’s not my own time that was wasted - I’m sure the leasing office, the BPD officers working on my case, and my friends who were helping me all had better things to do.

For present and future Apple customers, unless you have no other options (e.g. you live in a remote area), **do not consider Apple delivery.** Other Redditors have stated this advice in the comments below, and now I will join them in repeating it.",1677776390.0

Apple Should Support iCloud Drive Backups to Time Machine,295,11g2dsu,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11g2dsu/apple_should_support_icloud_drive_backups_to_time/,68,"BLUF/TLDR: Apple should make Time Machine capable of keeping local backups of data that has been offloaded from your device due to iCloud Drive's Optimize Storage option.

Apple has Time Machine to support local backups.

Apple offers Optimize Storage with iCloud Drive for those who have limited local hard drive space.

Unfortunately, any files MacOS decides to not keep locally due to Optimize Storage will also not get backed up to Time Machine nor other backup solutions that I'm aware of thus reducing those files offloaded to iCloud in a ""one copy state"" and at risk of data loss that can be caused by a multitude of things including user error.  Also changes made to those files on other devices will never make it to Time Machine unless you access that file on the Mac connected to Time Machine causing MacOS to download the file again.

I understand there are folks who have data caps and can not spare the possible excessive data movement which could be caused by such a system but I'd love to see Apple offer an option to get around this.

Just give us an option, along with a warning that the feature could cause excessive data usage, where Time Machine can temporarily download a file from iCloud Drive to back it up then remove the temp file.  It would only need to do this once for the most part as any files you are actively changing after that point would be downloaded anyway.  For files modified on other devices iCloud could use a Modified tag just like local incremental backups use so Time Machine could grab the most recent update for backup.

I dunno, I know this is full on TLDR material for a lot of folks but I'd love if I could get more people to think about this and maybe the community can start giving some pressure that Apple could eventually respond to.  I'm going to submit my suggestions to Apple but one dude ain't going to change the flow of Apples development.",1677762560.0

Dont trust iCloud with your Data! (lost many files),150,11ex473,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11ex473/dont_trust_icloud_with_your_data_lost_many_files/,284,"First of all I know that its kinda my fault for storing all of my documents only in iCloud but I somehow trusted Apple to keep my data safe after an old harddrive broke and I didn't wanna get my own nas system.

Two days ago I realized that almost 900Gigabytes of my Data in iCloud was just gone.   
All Folders were still there, only the files in the folders were missing.

I immediately  looked into my ""recently deleted"" folder in iCloud but there were no file in there.

Since I didn't know when or how my files were removed from my iCloud (which only I have access to) I contacted Apples support.

The Apple support told me to go to [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) and try the ""Data Recovery"" thing on the bottom of the site.

The ""Restore Files"" thing on [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) found 5000 deleted files that were to be permanently deleted in 2 days. So i instantly got to restoring those files. The website wasnt made to restore many files at once tho, so i had to restore them in packs of around 100files.   
Every time I reloaded the website the counter went back up to 5000 since there were much more than 5000 deleted files on my account.

After 2 days of almost continuous file restoration i was finally done...  
But most of my files, especially the important ones were still missing...

The (very nice) person from the apple support created a high priority ticket for the technicians in America to look at my case and get my files back.

Sadly the support rep called me a few minutes ago with the information that the techs finished the restoration... which by itself would be great news if not almost all of my files were still missing.

&#x200B;

So to sum it all up, I was stupid and trusted Apple that iCloud is a safe place to keep my data and now have lost more than 900gigs of photos, memories, documents and have no way of recovering them. (state registration card, purchase contract of my car,  rental contract of my flat, childhood photos, photos/memories of deceased relatives, all of my programming work from school, and so on)

So please always save your important files in multiple places and don't trust big companies to keep your data safe.

&#x200B;

What could Apple do differently for iCloud password resets,2,11dydtq,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11dydtq/what_could_apple_do_differently_for_icloud/,83,"There's been many recent conversations about the impact of a thief taking your phone and knowing your unlock passcode (either through shoulder surfing or forcing you to divulge it).  Apple needs to find a very difficult balance between: 
1.	Your data being kept safe from other people 
2.	You being able to get your data back even if you stuff up by forgetting or losing something 
3.	Respecting privacy and trust expectations, particularly with end to end encrypted data 
4.	Doing the above for the majority of the population that is technically incompetant, forgetful, often doesn’t read or follow basic instructions, and doesn’t plan ahead... 
  
Even with Apple’s current implementation we see many more people losing access due to forgotten passwords or broken/lost devices or out of date recovery info etc, vs the kind of theft being addressed here.  Forcing users to know the current password before changing it can’t be implemented without also removing the other password reset methods that trust the same device (eg. pushed 6 digit 2FA codes).  The net impact would be to significantly increase the number of people losing their data or at least being very unhappy at the delays of Account Recovery. 
  
While the obvious best move is for users to use longer alphanumeric passcodes and/or be careful who is looking when entering the passcode, most people won’t do this and the real world is messy (see #4 above).  I know, I know, personal responsibility and all that but it is what it is. 
  
Some PROACTIVE steps Apple COULD take, however are:
1.	More user education & warnings (eg. a “Security checkup” notification in Settings every 12 months - remind user about the passcode’s critical importance, check&update trusted numbers, recommend using Recovery Contacts, re-enter the Recovery Key to see if you’ve lost it etc) 
2.	When resetting the iCloud password or changing 2FA settings - *IF* a 28 digit Recovery Key is already set, require EITHER the current icloud password OR the Recovery Key to be supplied.  This enhances security for users who have decided to enable the recovery key, but some other people are going to lose their accounts by accident because they lost their recovery key and password... 
3.	[terrible idea] Add an optional separate passcode for the keychain.  This will lead to some people losing their keychains the same way people lose password protected notes and complain about it despite the warnings they’re given.  The extra passcode can also be extracted from you at gunpoint.  I hate this idea a lot - IMO its better to let people choose to add a separate password manager if they want, and remember this information can still be extracted from you by force - there is no way to avoid this. 
4.	[terrible idea] Add a “This device is trusted” setting. Disabling this blocks the device from changing iCloud security settings and receiving pushed 6 digit 2FA codes, or iCloud SMS 2FA codes being sent to it.  It can only be re-enabled via a different device logged into the same account, or with the Recovery Key.  I hate this idea too, its a nightmare. 
  
And some REACTIVE (post-theft) steps Apple COULD take are:  

5.	 Allow the Account Recovery process even if a Recovery Key is set, IF the recovery key was created in the last 1-2 weeks  
6.	Allow old (reset) Recovery Keys to be used for 1-2 weeks  
7.	Allow password resets via deleted Recovery Contacts, IF they were deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
8.	Allow use of an old trusted phone number for password reset or Account Recovery, IF it was deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  
9.	For arbitration of 6/7/8, successful use of an old item invalidates newer items of the same type",1677563629.0

Live photos are amazing.,801,11d8mjc,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11d8mjc/live_photos_are_amazing/,138,"My girlfriend and I have been going through a rough patch recently and I was looking back at old photos of us. I noticed that they were taken with live on and so I played them and in one she was laughing at the start of it and it made me break down crying, but not really in a bad way. I remember shortly after we took those photos she had told me she didn't like the live feature and I remember myself responding with something along the lines of ""I like to keep it on cause it might capture something special that I'd like to look back on later you know?""

It was honestly a nice reminder to never take anything or anyone for granted, and to cherish both the little and big things in life because they could easily disappear in the blink of an eye.

Just wanted to share that lol. Good luck to y'all and I hope you've created some memories through the feature as well :)",1677493732.0

I'm a doctor and just released my first app – a responsive mindful breathing app for stress & anxiety,94,11c8xf6,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11c8xf6/im_a_doctor_and_just_released_my_first_app_a/,31,"Website: https://www.lungy.app

Hey guys!

Lungy is an iOS app that responds to breathing in real time, transforming your breath into a playful, interactive experience. I started working on it in 2020 during the first UK lockdown as a way to make breathing exercises much more fun and engaging. It's initially a wellness app, but hopefully at some point it can be developed into a platform for people with breathing problems (asthma, COPD and long COVID). I think it really makes the most of iPhone hardware (it should run on iPhone 6S+), with real-time cloth, fluid and rigid body sims all running on the GPU. You can also even create your own music using a synth and sequencer (go to Settings/Create Music).

There are obviously lots of breathing and meditation apps out there, I wanted Lungy to be different - it's about tuning into your surroundings and noticing the world around you, so all the visuals are nature-inspired or have some reference to the physical world. I didn’t like other apps required large downloads and/or a wifi connection, so Lungy’s download size is very small (<50MB), with no geometry, video or audio files.

Ecosystem question from an oblivious ex-user,0,11bxoml,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11bxoml/ecosystem_question_from_an_oblivious_exuser/,49,"Hi,
I see so many YouTubers that just keep on saying the same thing over and over, that ""Apple devices just communicate well with each other"". I used to have some Apple devices back then, but I definitely did not see any ecosystem magic happening. My parents have the latest iPhones, Apple watches, Apple TVs but they apparently don't see anything either. But that may be because they aren't searching for it.
These days I myself am a Pixel user. The Pixel also has an ecosystem and I would like to find out how the Apple one is to compare, since I heard it's better.

So I decided to go here to ask for some nice examples of Apple devices working well together.

Update:
Thanks for educating me. Just to summarize what I learned, I decided to create a sort of ""Venn Diagram"" in text.

Apple only: using iPad as second screen, handoff (clipboard, files), stats from watch on AppleTV screen, using phone as webcam (although this is coming in Android 14), AirDrop with PC, signing phone documents on PC

Both: Headphone audio-switching, controlling TV, Find My, Synced texts between PC, phone and watch, ""AirDrop"" (in quotes because it's called Nearby Share on Android), Cloud sync, Password manager integrated into OS, Photos app syncing between devices, unlocking device with another device, AirPlay (Chromecast on Android), home devices automation (turning off TV when you're not home for example) - this last one requires set-up, continuing websites from computer on phone or vice versa, scanning documents to PC, transferring calls to other devices easily, starting maps on watch when phone navigation starts and vice versa

Google only: Headphone audio-switching on Windows, Synced texts on Windows, Touching 2 devices to wirelessly transfer files, being able to open Android apps on Windows and them syncing with your phone apps, USB tethering (extremely underrated, low-key amazing)

I think I put everything you guys mentioned in here. Thanks for clarifying, from what it seems, the gap isn't really big.

Thank you for providing the previous version of the iCloud terms and conditions. I have compared it to the current version and here are the key changes that I have identified:

* Section 1 (Terms and Conditions) has been updated to clarify that the agreement governs your use of iCloud and any related Apple services, products, and software.
* The previous version of Section 2 (Your Account) included a subsection on the use of Touch ID and Face ID to access iCloud. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your Apple ID.
* Section 3 (Use of iCloud) has been updated to include a subsection on iCloud Backup, which allows you to backup and restore data from your iOS or iPadOS devices.
* The previous version of Section 4 (iCloud Services) included a subsection on iCloud Keychain. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead includes a subsection on ""iCloud Private Relay,"" a new feature designed to enhance the privacy and security of your internet activity.
* Section 6 (User Content) has been updated to include a subsection on Live Photos, which allows you to share animated photos with others through iCloud.
* Section 10 (Apple's Intellectual Property) has been updated to clarify that Apple may use feedback you provide about iCloud to improve the service.
* The previous version of Section 11 (Indemnification) included a subsection on the use of Touch ID and Face ID to access iCloud. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using ""biometric authentication"" to access your Apple ID.
* Section 12 (Dispute Resolution) has been updated to include a subsection on class action waivers, which prohibit you from bringing claims against Apple as part of a class action or consolidated action.

These are the key changes that I have identified between the previous version and the current version of the iCloud terms and conditions. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other changes that I did not identify or that are less significant.**

Later Edit:  **As embarassing as this is, I'm going to leave this up instead of deleting it. But I've learned a valuable lesson in AI being ""confidently incorrect"" or better more accurately, bullshit it pulled out of its ass.    I would have expected this to be a start to understand the terms better but in manually comparing them, there's not even the words ""biometric"" anywhere in the new terms nor ""face id"" and ""touch id"" in the old terms, to pick a simple but glaring example.**",1677246322.0
My hate-love relationship with the HomePod as a music enthusiast,37,11ar6ro,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11ar6ro/my_hatelove_relationship_with_the_homepod_as_a/,26,"I hadn’t paid much attention to the HomePod since the initial release because it was limited to be an Apple Music streaming box. I started looking into it when I heard about the new release. But more importantly, the possibility of using a pair as a stereo AirPlay device in macOS.

It had been a while since I was looking for the perfect transportable audio setup, as I am always on the go. I like neutral sound; at home, I have KEF LS50 speakers with a NuPrime amp and the go Campfire Ara IEMs with a Dragonfly DAC/amp. Finding a good comprise that would allow good sound and the possibility of being transported in a suitcase by plane was challenging. I had been thinking of going with an Apollo Twin and small bookshelves from either PreSonus or Neumann. But it was still a lot of weight, and the setup would not go very low.

I went to the Apple Store for a listening session, but unfortunately, laying HomePods on a table 50 cm below the ears with ambient noise does not do the trick. I ended up coming back home with two.

After setting them up as pair and selecting the output in macOS, I opened the Audio Midi Setup to check the bitrate and depth. I was pretty sure I heard AirPlay2 was bringing lossless, but there are some nuances ([Apple AirPlay 2 supports 24-bit lossless audio, but you can’t use it | digitaltrends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/apple-homepod-24-bit-lossless-audio-airplay-2/)), and we are stuck at 16bit 44.1kHz. Figure out the logic behind being in the ecosystem (streaming from a MacBook or an iPhone) but still being software lock to the lowest quality. Cherry on the cake is bye-bye streaming the ALAC library, their own lossless codec.

Sound-wise, I admit it’s impressive! They sound way bigger than they are,  the soundstage is excellent. The high feels pretty bright, and the mids are clear. But when it comes to the base, although they are well-defined, they are way too pushed. I check the setting in the Home app to discover that there is an option to reduce bass. It sounds way better; it leaves room for the rest, but it feels like a straight cut below 70Hz. So we are stuck between choosing overkilled lows or no bass; it feels incomprehensible, given the potential of the hardware.

Even with these unpleasant surprises, I will keep the pair of HomePod because it corresponds best to my use case. It’s an unbeatable form factor for the sound, the DSP is great, and the setup is frictionless. It would not take that much to make the HomePod appealing to a broader audience with a software update that:

* Allow lossless streaming via AirPlay from any Apple device
* Add an EQ setting for the HomePod in Home app",1677244676.0

Does Apple notify if if a pair of 2nd Generation AirPods Pro’s has been following you?,16,11ahpgh,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11ahpgh/does_apple_notify_if_if_a_pair_of_2nd_generation/,12,"
Like, if someone’s trying to steal a car that costs tens of thousands of dollars or something, a pair of AirPods Pro’s seems like a small investment, which they’d also get back if the car was stolen, or, if someone is obsessed enough with a person, they could just use AirPods to track them. Yes, it’s not nearly as discrete as an AirTag, but it’s still not that difficult to hide if you try, especially in a car. The battery won’t last that long, but I’d still be creepy.

I haven’t lost my pair yet, so I can’t say if this is how they work, but Apple claims that they can be precisely tracked.",1677210586.0

Announcing Notifications,19,11ack7m,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11ack7m/announcing_notifications/,6,"Has anyone had any success getting their iPad or Apple Watch to announce notifications out loud?

I’ve been experimenting with this Announce Notifications. On my iPhone 14, I successfully got it to start announcing notifications from some of my most important applications. I went through the process of toggling on Announce Notifications, selecting those apps that I want it to announce notifications from, and then toggling on Announce Notifications on Speaker.

I followed the same process on my iPad Mini 5. Yet despite me toggling on the same buttons, etc. that I did on my iPhone, my iPad Mini doesn’t announce the notifications. Again, this is weird because I did the same thing on my iPad Mini, that I did on my iPhone, which now successfully announces the notifications I want it to.

Also, I toggled on the Announce Notifications button on my Apple Watch, and selected the apps I wanted it to do so for. But yet, my Apple Watch is not announcing the notifications.

Am I missing something here? Some steps? Any insight into why my iPhone successfully announces notifications but my iPad and Apple Watch won’t?

One of the rare times where a product leaves you amazed,36,119ri2l,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/119ri2l/one_of_the_rare_times_where_a_product_leaves_you/,8,"I have owned the AirPods Pro for a while and upgraded to the 2nd Gen when they were released. I haven't had any issues losing any gadgets in a long while (knock on wood!), so in early January when I was traveling for work and staying in a friend's apartment while he was away it was disappointing when I couldn't find my AirPods. ""Find My"" had listed them at my location a mere 45 minutes earlier, but they were nowhere to be seen. I figured my streak had come to an end and I went out a few days later to replace them (they never popped back up on the map and I had them okay a sound and never heard anything).

Skip ahead to 6-7 weeks later and I had just arrived back at my friend's apartment for another work trip. I always pay for a professional cleaning after I stay there and I walked in to find two earbuds sitting on the counter near the washing machine... ! I felt a pit in my stomach and searched the washing machine for the case and eventually found it in the dryer, sticking to the ceiling. *The AirPods had been washed and dried. * 

I reached in and, trying to look on the bright side (they weren't lost, after all), collected the case. I opened it up to take a look and was shocked to see the light go on... And then my phone vibrated and let me know that my AirPods had been located! Could it be, could they be functional? I put the earbuds into the case and plugged it in to charge. 

Thirty minutes later came the moment of truth--I unplugged them and put them into my ears. The familiar tone sounded and my phone connected to them! And then, I went to Apple Music and ... They sounded perfectly normal! After having been lost for over a month, during which time they were fully laundered, it was as if nothing ever happened!

Maybe I shouldn't be impressed... But I am. To go through that sort of ordeal and still work perfectly well could easily be luck (and it probably is!), but it still shows a level of quality and reliability that I don't readily associate with other brands or products.

Anyway, I don't know why anyone should care about this trivial story, but I thought I'd share so my positive experience is noted and in case it helps anyone to hear it.",1677136620.0

Nothing has changed with my voice, though I did buy an upgraded iPhone.  But what has coincided with updates over the last two years is that its voice to text got a lot worse - then, very recently, it became garbage tier.

It's little wonder why I see so many drivers texting now - we can't rely on the phone to not make the other party pissed off.  But it isn't merely while commuting - it's also in the calm work environment.

And what's with it constantly trying to leave a space between the period at the end of sentences?  What's with commas placed in nonsensical places?  I'd much rather it skip trying to punctuate my voice than punctuating it badly.",1677158811.0

Iphone 8/plus is peak design,0,118dih1,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/118dih1/iphone_8plus_is_peak_design/,35,"Hear me out. 

Even though I'm usually an android user, I always tried out some apple products, including iPhones (I'm a tech fan, I do not stick to only one company) 

But the early iPhones always kissed my eyes tbh. 

I'm currently rocking an iPhone SE (22) next to a P6P, and I may stick to the iPhone for a longer period. 

I LOVE the Design with homebutton. It feels and looks so timeless and elegant. 

My biggest wish would be that apple keeps doing the SE lineup in this design or even add one in the Plus-Size like the 8 plus. Maybe put an OLED in it, but I'm fine with the IPS retina as well. 

I love that you can hold this phone without being on the screen instantly, I don't know what it is, but I prefer this sleek look with a square display over the modern, almost bezel-less designs. 

I can't be alone with this",1677009510.0

Apple's Standard Warranty Surprise,0,118hp08,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/118hp08/apples_standard_warranty_surprise/,8,"I purchased a 5th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro in November. Apple's standard warranty expires in August '23 for this unit. It was sold to me as excellent condition, which it was when I received it. It was much brighter than the 4th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro that I also have. I purchased a 6th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro recently. All purchased used, 'Open Box' on eBay. 

As I was synchronizing the settings of the 6th GEN side-by-side with the 4th and 5th GEN units, I noticed that the 5th GEN was much brighter than the other two. Now I realized that on the 5th GEN *True Tone,* a feature of these iPads, wasn't activated yet. But it was! That's when I realized it wasn't functioning! I called Apple and the result was that it needed a repair that was covered under the standard 12 month hardware warranty. So I sent it in to Apple.

I was just informed by Apple that the repair could not be made because there was another problem with the device. The USB plug receptacle was damaged and that it needed to be replaced. That type of damage is not covered under the standard warranty. My choices were to not have the repairs done, or to let Apple keep and recycle the unit or, cough, pay $799 for the repair.🤮

I used that unit daily since November. I experienced no problem with the USB plug receptacle. Yet here I am. This is not a complaint. My days of complaining are over. I will accept the unit back of course. I'm curious to see what, if any, difference there is with the USB plug receptacle when I receive it back! If it is returned as I sent it in, I can do without *True Tone.* When the 7th GEN iPad 12.9 is released, I'll get that one too.

I always get AppleCare+ but the unit needs to be within the time frame that one would qualify to purchase AppleCare+. This unit was beyond that time period.

Warranties of any kind, from any company, are not black or white. They are gray. In this matter, for me, it is insignificant. But for a hard-working young person who struggles to get along in life, I believe this would be a big disappointment.

iOS 16.3 can delete data on your iPhone/iPad without asking - I've lost 2500+ books,35,116lmfa,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/116lmfa/ios_163_can_delete_data_on_your_iphoneipad/,8,"Hello,

In Feb iOS 16.3 has deleted all my 2500+ books from Apple Books on iPad. ePubs and articles in PDFs, which were sorted in many categories.

Probably, it has happened because my iPad's storage was full and iOS had decided to delete books instead of caches, offloading apps or deleting iCloud photos (which can be re-downloaded from the cloud).

Without informing the user, of course. iCloud wasn't enabled for Apple Books. No JB.

Here is the story:

I was browsing in the evening, when my iPad has turned off - the battery was empty. I've connected the charger and left it till the morning. In the morning iPad was up and running, I was using it as usual. Few hours later I've opened Apple Books and it was empty: no books, no covers, just empty collections. Checked iPad Storage tab - 50Gb free space (this space was occupied by Books) and Apple Books with 0MB for Documents.

Ok, going to logs - nothing unusual. Silence. Ok, I have a full iTunes backup, not the freshest one - 6 months old, but better than no backup at all.

I was able to get into my iPad to make as low-level examination as possible.

What I've checked:

    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases - empty, all books were deleted
    BKLibrary - empty, only categories
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases/Purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases/Backup-Purchases.plist - empty
    /var/mobile/Media/Books/Sync/Books.plist - some titles and filenames, but not all

I've identified when books were deleted - at 03:52:

    BKLibrary (recovered records):
    Table ZBKCOLLECTIONMEMBER
    xx/02/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;

Bingo! Time is the same as in BKLibrary when records (and books!) were deleted.

So, iOS has silently deleted all books.

Later I have written a custom parser, which examined 2 600 000+ rows of raw data of some internal indexes, which iOS uses and it helped me to recover some info: titles and file names.

Still a long way to combine all findings for recovery.

Findings:

* iOS 16.3 can delete all books without asking
* iTunes Full Backup is not backing up sideloaded PDFs & ePubs in Apple Books
* When Apple Books app is backed up via iTunes, BKLibrary database is vacuumed, so no deleted data inside.
* No info is logged about deletion - but I'm checking for extra evidences
* Logs are clean: no suspicious activity
* There are no single place with metadata for Apple Books - I'm assembling info piece by piece from many places in iOS: databases, logs, activity data, thumbnails etc. 90% manual work.

I'll make a new post later, including all details related to my Apple Books forensics and recovery.

&#x200B;

P.S. Keep in mind that iOS can delete any data anytime - do manual backups. iCloud can fail as well - imagine losing years of private photos...",1676834931.0

Apple's $3000 Laptop: A Heater or a MacBook Pro i9?,0,1164y1v,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1164y1v/apples_3000_laptop_a_heater_or_a_macbook_pro_i9/,24," Hello everyone,

If you're a MacBook Pro user, you may be familiar with the issues that have plagued the 2018 i9 models. Despite the significant price tag, these laptops suffer from severe overheating and throttling issues that can make the computer nearly unusable.

Many users have reported that their MacBook Pro i9s will overheat and then slow down or shut down to prevent damage to the system. This problem can occur even when the laptop is not under heavy load, making it difficult to use for even basic tasks.

What's even more frustrating is that Apple has remained largely silent on the issue. Despite numerous complaints and even a petition signed by over 11,000 people, the company has not taken any significant action to address the problem or compensate affected customers.

It's not right that users have to spend so much money on a product that fails to live up to its promises. It's even worse that Apple hasn't faced any consequences for this issue, leaving users feeling frustrated and unheard.

So I'm asking you, fellow MacBook Pro i9 users, do you think it's right that Apple hasn't faced any consequences for these issues? What steps should the company take to address the problem and make things right for affected customers?

Let's raise our voices and demand action from Apple on this issue. Our hard-earned money deserves a laptop that works properly. Thank you for your time and attention.",1676793595.0
"Just released a major update to Dime, a beautiful and intuitive personal finance tracker and budgeting tool. Now with income tracking, overall budgets, UI redesigns and more!",283,1166geu,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1166geu/just_released_a_major_update_to_dime_a_beautiful/,68,"Hey r/apple! Hope you’re having a great weekend.

TLDR: [Dime 2.0](https://apple.co/3ANcqCN) is here with income tracking, overall budgets, a UI makeover and more! It is a beautiful, intuitive expense tracker built with iOS design guidelines in mind. And, it's 100% free with no ads or paywalls.

Nearly half a year ago, I launched Dime 1.0 as a project to kickstart my programming journey, and was taken aback by the response. I am immensely grateful for all the comments, reviews, and feedback I have gotten ever since, majority of them being from this subreddit!

The most requested feature by far had got to be income tracking. I was initially rather reluctant to add this in as it would essentially require a complete overhaul and migration of existing data models and the UI built around them. Additionally, I felt it would diminish the simplicity of the app that many users had grown to love. Nonetheless, with the help of the 300 beta testers on TestFlight, I was able to experiment with different integrations of this new feature, and eventually landed on one I was really satisfied with.

Today, I’m proud to present Dime 2.0, its biggest update thus far. And of course, no changes to the pricing model - still a 100% free with no ads, paywalls, or data collection.

💥 What's New in V2.0!

-	The feature requested in almost every support email - income tracking.
-	Redesigned input interface that minimises excessive swiping if you have many categories.
-	Redesigned category list with category suggestions and the ability to reorder categories.
-	Rebuilt the Insights page to minimise lag and crashes.
-	Lock screen widgets for iOS 16.
-	Overall category-less budgets!.
-	Added interactive line graph to the Home page (turned off by default, can be accessed via Feature Lab in Settings).
-	Insight filtering configuration now persists between sessions i.e. if you configure your Insights page to show monthly statistics, it will stay that way from then on (and not revert to the default, which is weekly insights).
-	Added triangular indicators to the budget bar graphs which show the optimal spending percentage.
-	Option to have a more compact Budgets page by swapping the grid for rows.
-	Custom time frames (e.g. 3 days, 5 weeks, 7 months) for recurring transactions.
-	Swipe to delete transactions.

🥰 Why You’ll Love Dime

-	100% free forever, with no paywall or ads.
-	Beautifully iOS-centric design, with simplicity at its core.
-	Insightful expenditure breakdowns over various time periods.
-	Create budgets based on expense categories and stick to them.
-	Create recurring expenses with custom time frames.
-	Sync your expenses, categories and budgets with other devices via iCloud.
-	Custom reminders to input your expenses.
-	Biometric authentication to protect your data.
-	Home screen quick actions make capturing new expenses a breeze.
-	A gorgeous night theme for dark mode fanatics.
-	Informative home and lock screen widgets keep you updated at a glance.

I genuinely hope Dime will be able to help you cultivate prudent expenditure habits. Any feedback or thoughts is welcomed, and appreciated. Moreover, if you have found Dime to be useful, it would be incredibly helpful if you could give it a great review on the App Store. Am unable to afford marketing for a free app, so ratings and reviews are my best bet at spreading the word about it.

A special thanks to all those who have generously tipped the app, all proceeds will go towards my upcoming Apple Developer subscription cycle payment 😊

Have a great week ahead!

beware ordering same day delivery,515,11655bs,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/11655bs/beware_ordering_same_day_delivery/,133,"I ordered a new macbook pro for my company. It was to be delivered to my house by postmates/uber within a few hours. I received a text saying get ready for your delivery. Then a text saying your delivery is arriving. A guy came to my door w/ an apple bag, showing my name and address and order #, and my new computer was taped into the bag. He asked me if my name was ? I said yes. He had me sign for the delivery. I took the bag and shut my door. I received a text saying my order was delivered. A few minutes later, he rang my door again. I don’t know why I answered. But I answered, and he said he had delivered to the wrong address and he must take my computer back from me, please hand it over. WTF? I said no, this is my computer, I paid for it, I signed for it, I have all the payment and delivery receipts. He kept insisting and implying that I was a thief. I got my husband involved. My husband tried showing the guy the bag proving this is the correct address and he needs to leave. The guy kept threatening saying he’s going to ask one more time then he will call the cops. I told him to call the cops then, and shut the door. 

He called the cops, I called the cops, they came, were super bored w/ the whole thing, it was clear the delivery guy was in the wrong, they showed him the actual bag he gave me that the computer was in, that listed my name and address and order#, proving he was at the right address. The cops said the guy then apologized to them and drove away. 

But I was left shaking and nerves a mess. So I called apple to let them know what happened w/ their delivery. The lady on the phone was horrified and apologetic, said that should never have happened, told me I did everything right disengaging and contacting police, that the guy handled it wrong. She said he is not law enforcement so if he thought he made a mistake he had no authority to go demand my computer back from me, he should have contacted apple and they would have easily and quickly confirmed that he delivered to the correct address. 

So going forward I am going to just pick up my orders myself rather than trust Uber drivers, and highly recommend for others whenever you can.",1676794325.0
[Promo Codes] Jester is a new iOS app that writes photo captions for you,75,1163dw4,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1163dw4/promo_codes_jester_is_a_new_ios_app_that_writes/,37,"[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1661372840)

Hi all, I thought it would be cool to use AI for something fun, so I made an [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jester-ai-caption-writer/id1661372840) that writes **Instagram captions for you using just an image**—including puns, jokes, and hashtags. It usually gets the captions right and I’ve been pretty astonished by how funny some of them can be.

How it works is you pick any photo (no sign-in required) Jester generates four unique captions. From there, you can choose your favorite and edit it as you wish. If you're not happy with any of the captions, click the retry button to generate four more. You can also add context, use the photo location, or generate more variants of any caption. When you're happy, you can copy the caption, share it, or post to Instagram.

Captioning 5 photos is free every day and there's a paid subscription for Unlimited captions (because running AI models is expensive), but I will share a promo code for a **free year with the first 5 people who comment** with a caption written by Jester! If you're not one of the first 5, don't worry because you can have 1 free month using the code [SUNDAY](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY) which can be redeemed at [https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=1661372840&code=SUNDAY) (on iPhone or iPad)

Apple Store Repair and Service is Really Dissapointing,0,1160ok3,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1160ok3/apple_store_repair_and_service_is_really/,22,"This is a bit of a rant, 

I spent a large part of today driving to and from the Apple Store to get my companies older 2015 15” MBP looked at. Random shutdowns on battery have been happening for a number of years but it hasn’t been a priority since it has been plugged in most of the time. We’ve recently brought someone new on and wanted to give them this Mac to use - but they need something reliable while being away from power. 

I was pretty sure the battery was the issue, but I did not want to get it replaced only for it to be something more serious like the logic board. We’re a small company and need to be smart about our expenses. The battery cycles are 280-300 for a 7 year old computer. I spent 30 minutes on Apple Chat last week and they recommended going in-store to get it looked at where they can do more in depth diagnostics. It’s a 40 min drive each way, but if it helps illuminate the issue then its worth it. 

First off, everyone at the Conestoga (Canada) Apple Store was very nice. My complaints are not about their direct service but the corporate policies they have to follow. 

They ran a diagnostic on the laptop and it came back with 80% battery health. They ran the diagnostic plugged in. I had it unplugged a couple of times at the Apple Store and it would shutdown as it usually does when the battery is sub 60%. In the rare cases where it does not shut down the battery drops really fast. 

I am more than willing to pay for the battery to be replaced. But, in order to replace the battery on the 2015 models they need to replace the top case (keyboard, trackpad). **Because the battery health is at 80% (and not 79% or lower) - they can’t replace the battery without charging me for a top case replacement! **The battery fee as quoted on their website is $250 (all prices in Canadian dollars), but with the mandatory top case replacement it jumps to around $700. Not worth it for a 7-8 year old computer. 

What frustrates me is, the Apple Tech in-store had no agency in the matter. It was clear as day the battery was failing and leading to restarts. Yet his own system would not let him order the battery replacement without the top case charge being applied because it was 1% over the required number for it to be eligible. His best solution was to use the laptop on battery as much as possible until it hits 79% and then to come back to get it fixed. Driving 40 mins each way again in the hope that they will replace the battery seems like a bit of a fools errand.

Over the last couple of years I have had other repair needs (Apple Watch battery, AirPods Connection issues) and the experience always ends up being the same. The people at the store can see the issue, but have no agency to get it fixed. 

This laptop in particular, was purchased at the Apple Store for $2500+ CAD, plus Apple Care +. We never used Apple Care before it expired and now we’re being denied a battery replacement (without paying the extra fee) because the health is 1% off replacement level according to their diagnostics. Yet the real world performance is clearly failing at a basic level. 

I am a little late to the game in getting Apple Devices, but my impression was that Apple had the best service and while they charge a lot for their tech - the support is top notch. That simply has not been my experience in any interaction I have had with them in the last 3-5 years. I don’t know if this is a Canada issue, or all Apple Stores. But I am just do disappointed in the entire process. I don’t have a lot of free time and to waste it on something like this is really frustrating.",1676778263.0
iCloud backup overrides whatsapp in app backup so what’s the point in of people backing up both?,14,115zt3u,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/115zt3u/icloud_backup_overrides_whatsapp_in_app_backup_so/,28,"By making a iCloud backup your saving everything on the iPhone - a copy 

If you were to make a WhatsApp in app backup a couple of days AFTER your latest iCloud backup, then have to reset or transfer your device and install from that said iCloud backup it would load the iCloud WhatsApp backup that’s 3 days old ? Not the newest in app backup that was made in WhatsApp that was made 3 days later ? Because it’s saved on the drive itself ? 

So essentially iOS will always load the iCloud backup before the WhatsApp in app backup ?

In early January, my M1 iPad Pro 12.9"" stopped charging about 16 months after purchasing. Now I am an electronics hobbyist and I know a thing or two about troubleshooting and I did all I could without opening the iPad. When I contacted apple support they told me I needed to make a Genius Bar appointment and the only ones available in a reasonable timeframe were during the work day. So I took a couple hours off to drive out the the apple store only to have to wait an extra 30m after my appointment time for the ""Genius"" to check the USB port for dust and verify it wasn't charging (Something I already did before) before telling me I was screwed and a replacement would be $800. I ended up taking it to a third party repair shop and they replaced the USB C port for $200.

Recently I noticed my AirPod Pro 2 case battery was draining about 20-25% per day without even using the earbuds. Apparently this is a common problem that multiple people report having. I called Apple and they guided me through resetting the device and told me to call them again if the problem persisted, so I did. When I called them again after testing, they told me I could schedule a Genius Bar appointment and get a replacement. So I repeat the process and drive out for the appointment and the ""Genius"" takes my AirPods to the back to run some tests. When he comes back out after 20m he tells me he could not find anything wrong with them and that my options were to live with the problem or send it in to an Apple repair center. I opted to send them in. We'll see if Apple lives up to their warranty or not...

Either way, each of these appointments took about 1h30m of my time only to have Apple's Genius representative to tell me to pound sand. In both of my experiences, the in-person representatives I met were unhelpful, uncompassionate, and slightly rude. Apple products cost way too much to have this poor of a support experience

""if you stop paying for your icloud storage, you will receive a pop-up on your phone telling you to pay. if you refuse, you will have 30 days to get your data from the cloud before it's erased permanently. if in those 30 days you decide to keep paying, all your stuff will remain there.""  
i have questions about this:  
there are 2 routes that are in question:  
1. the route where you simply do not pay for icloud storage and do not downgrade (which has already been specified that one will have 30 days to download all of the data before it gets wiped)   
2. the route where you downgrade your icloud storage to the default 5gb (which it is unknown to me what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb) to not have to pay monthly anymore  
for the second route, i wish to know what will happen to the data that exceeds 5gb once i downgrade my icloud storage; what will happen to my backups? will my photos still be read from icloud storage (for full resolution)?  
tl;dr: i have very valuable data on my icloud storage that, due to financial reasons, cannot be kept paid monthly, so i plan to downgrade my icloud storage, and i can't download all of my icloud storage to any of my devices because they don't have enough storage either, so i ask 3 questions:  
1. what will happen to the data that exceeds the default 5gb?  
2. what will happen to my data backups?  
3. will my photos still be read from icloud storage (meaning that will the optimized saved photos on my iphone still read the full resolution videos and images placed on icloud)?",1676687912.0

Right now im looking into it again and am checking for the features and apps/ workflows that apparently don't ""just work"" with iOS.

One example is the smart charging. There seems to be a feature for determining how one uses his phone and then charging it till 80% and only completing the charge once the used algorithm deems it the right time. Right not I only charge my android for a few minute a day so that i reaches about 80% and have hard capped it there. Due to the slow charging speed iPhones I would charge it overnight and therefore need this feature to work properly.

From what I found online this system doesn't seem to work that well and on my girlfriends XR it deems 3AM the perfect time to be fully charged... 

So why is there no setting to set a specific time for the phone to be fully charged or even better, have it depend on the set alarm time of the next day? Is there a way to set these obviously needed settings and I just didn't find them?

Are there other ways to fix this?",1676669324.0

Recommendations to improve Apple Health's Medications feature,34,114al8g,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/114al8g/recommendations_to_improve_apple_healths/,12,"# *TL;DR - Let's create a singular master thread of requests, to send to Apple, for Apple Health's Medication functionality.*

I was so excited by the new Medications offering in Apple Health. As a chronically ill person who has more than 12 medications to track (and often change) every day, I was relieved that Apple would finally offer us something that I wasn't getting from 3rd party apps, as well as the bonus of smooth integration across my Apple devices (really important for my physical disabilities). 

The initial offering is ok, but it has HUGE potential. I've no doubt Apple already has a long list of features and changes they plan to make with the functionality but I know from a product development standpoint, it's really important that they hear from the consumers which requests are most vital. I'm not entirely sure if they have, or plan to, consult with people who have chronic or complex health issues, but I do feel it's important we let them know they could really help improve our lives with a few tweaks. 

This realisation led me to start submitting through their [Health feedback form](https://www.apple.com/feedback/health/). Unfortunately there is a character limit and I know that most people will not submit a form for every single suggestion. I personally gave up after the first 5. So I've come to the conclusion of creating a master thread that can be shared with them directly. That's what I'm hoping to achieve here. 

If you use the Medications feature, or even just tried it but didn't continue, please have your say. If someone has already made a suggestion you agree with, upvote it! Please also include your country, as functionality currently varies and will be helpful to give context to your feedback/suggestion.

Thank you in advance 😊",1676608143.0

Whats the point of 2FA if you can just change your password on your iPhone without it? (Medellin gunpoint robbery),0,113wqdl,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/113wqdl/whats_the_point_of_2fa_if_you_can_just_change/,50,"Just read a terrible story in Medellin Reddit of a girl in a city park getting tossed down a hill and robbed.  They made her write down her Apple password.  Then of course they changed the password on her Apple account.  Apple is of no help recovering her Account and of course the phone is gone, etc.

After being glad the girl is OK, I thought for sure that I was protected from something like this because I have 2FA.

Nope!  When you head to settings, it says, ""Because you are logged into iCloud, you can change your password.""  No 2FA!  Then it says ""you want to log out of all your other devices?""

Every other little thing I log into, for instance the New York Times that I signed up for using Apple's anonymous email service, requires me to use 2FA.  

So why when changing the password am I not required to do any 2FA?  Is it because if you lose your password they could just send it to your email which is on your phone anyway?  

Is there a way to truly theft-proof your phone?   Because when a gun is pointed at you, its a good idea to fork everything over including passwords.",1676570375.0

"Apple and Uber have left me empty-handed and out of pocket - $2,098.04 dollars worth of apple products stolen from an Uber Eats driver",1720,113gn1g,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/113gn1g/apple_and_uber_have_left_me_emptyhanded_and_out/,958,"I recently had a terrible experience with Apple and Uber that I wanted to share with you. I ordered an iPhone 14 Pro Max and an Apple Watch Ultra GPS watch through Apple's website, which were supposed to be delivered to me by UberEats. I paid extra for the items to be picked up from a local Apple store and hand-delivered to my address. The Uber driver assigned to the delivery falsely marked it as delivered and never showed up, despite my clear instructions and follow-up text messages. I waited outside the entire time and the delivery wasn't ever made.

I contacted Apple Support, and although they initially agreed to replace one of the items, the watch they later decided to cancel the replacement order, and denied me the replacement for the phone. The result of this has left me with a $2,098.04 hole in my pocket and leaving me with no other recourse. To add insult to injury, unfortunately, the police department is unable to file a report for civil matters.

I am deeply disappointed by the lack of assistance and resolution from both Uber and Apple. I have evidence of the conversations with the driver and video footage of me waiting for the delivery outside my building. My question to the community is, has anyone else ever experienced anything like this with Apple, and if so, do you have any recommendations on how to best address this matter?

I hope that my experience will serve as a cautionary tale and that both companies will take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. I realize that this is an unofficial community site for Apple and while I have no expectations of this message being seen by them, I wanted to raise awareness to everyone making purchases directly from the Apple store, especially via the use of third-party delivery services such as uber-eats and postmates.

**\*Update 02/16/2023\***

Today, I spent several hours speaking with various Apple representatives from the escalations team. Eventually, I was connected to a ""Senior Manager of the Online Store"" who informed me that the investigation into the matter has been closed and that Apple will not be pursuing any further investigations. According to Apple, a delivery was made, and they will not be compensating me for my losses. I requested evidence that the delivery was made to me personally, but the representative stated that information regarding the internal investigation could not be disclosed to me.

After my attempts to contact Apple and resolve this amicably, I feel like I have hit a dead end, and unfortunately, the criminal who stole my $2,098.04 worth of Apple products appears to be getting away with the theft. I am utterly speechless.

I made contact with a second police department in my area who was willing to make a police report and filed this under ""Grand theft"". I now have this along with the other evidence I've collected.

**\*Update 02/17/2023\***

I am pleased to inform you that a member of Apple's leadership team contacted me and has agreed to issue a full refund for the total cost of the stolen items.  I am thankful for the opportunity provided by Apple to resolve my issue. However, the refund process to my original payment method is still pending, which might take a few days considering the holiday on Monday in the US. I remain optimistic that I will receive my money back by Tuesday and will update this thread as soon as the entire amount has been refunded.

However, it is disheartening to know that the criminal responsible for this theft may get away with it. Sadly, this is the unfortunate reality of living in California. Nonetheless, I appreciate the effort and attention given to this matter by Apple's leadership team.

To the Apple subreddit community, I would like to express my gratitude for the valuable comments, feedback, and advice provided. Your input has been immensely helpful, and I sincerely appreciate your time and effort. Thank you all for your contributions.

**\*Update 02/22/2023\***

As of this morning, my bank account has been credited with the total refund amount as per the commitment made by Apple's leadership team.

I also wanted to highlight that despite the promise of two separate representatives asserting that the team responsible for handling loss/theft of items would be reaching out to me within 24-48 hours on the 16th (6 days ago), UberEats **never** made any attempt to contact me regarding this matter.",1676517563.0

After alternative stores come to iOS… - Discussion,0,112s1uz,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/112s1uz/after_alternative_stores_come_to_ios_discussion/,55,"Hi just wanted to pick your heads. IMO alt stores are going to cause a clusterfu*k environment, I fear that you will have to have 7 app stores installed just to get 7 apps. Epic will be one, google, microsoft, meta and many more will i think push for their own stores. And if you have your app on one store there is no need to be on another. 

Also I fear the amount of unveted apps that will flood the market and inevitable wreck all the good apple has done with their tracking policies.

Notes, reminders (more on that later), unlock your devices with the watch, airDrop etc. It would be really hard to switch back to PC/Android as it doesn't really have any of that. However...

Apple watch can unlock my iPhone and MacBooks but not my iPad. One of my laptops is 7-8 years and my iPad is the latest pro with m2.

The Books app knows my position in ebooks across devices but for audio books (bought in the apple store) it doesn't sync. Also, if I'm listening to an audio book on my iPhone there is no indication of this in ""playing now"" on my Apple watch.

If I leave my computer somewhere that isn't my home and then leave I will get a notification on my apple watch that I left it behind. If I leave it at home I don't get that notification. So far so good. But even if I go out for a walk with the dog I will always get a notification that my iPad is left behind.

If I listen to a song on Apple music on my phone and pause it then tell Siri on my watch to continue playing music it will play whatever I played on my watch before.

Alarms set on my phone will sound on my watch. Alarms set on my watch will not sound on my phone. This one I actually kind of like but it would be nice if there was an option to only have the alarm ring on certain devices depending on focus model. I probably shouldn't get started on Siri since she really suck, but a small thing like ""set an alarm on my iPhone"" get the response ""set the alarm for when?"" ""1 minute"" ... alarm is only set on your watch, not your phone. 

I never get any reminders on my iPad. iPhone, Apple watch and macbooks all do.

Is this intended behaviour and I'm just not ""getting"" it? Are there any workarounds for any of my niggles? I'm open to third-party apps, especially for audio books since I really dislike the Apple audio book interface in general.",1676393130.0

I am an independent developer from India.

I have built an app called [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-promo-sunday-1202-01), a personal AI Writing assistant that works seamlessly across all your Mac apps, as well as an AI-enabled keyboard for your iPhone and iPad.

Just released a new version of the app last week.

Update: Elephas and ChatGPT are not the same; they have slightly different use cases. Elephas applies an AI layer on top of your Mac while you continue to follow your workflow.

**Version 5.3 Updates:**

In the latest version, I have released features such as -

**Snippets -** Configure shortcuts to perform day-to-day tasks with the help of AI. It supports all popular languages. You can do tasks across your apps, including editors and spreadsheet tools.

**Tones** - To personalize text output and write in your own unique style.

**Preserve Formatting** - So that the generated text maintains the format and styling of the original text.

And many more tiny improvements and utilities.

# A brief overview of the tool -

First off, very pleased to share that now 500+ professional users use the app every day :)

Elephas helps business professionals use AI to save time on day-to-day tasks. Emails, documents, blogs, JIRA stories, social media posts, etc.

Our users praise it as a Swiss Army knife for their daily productivity.

**""An AI tool that they actually use in their daily workflow""**

It differs from other AI tools in that it works on top of your favorite apps, so there is no need to switch between windows or work in a browser window.

You can get the power of AI within your favorite Mac apps like Mail, Pages, Docs, and any other apps built for the Mac.

With Elephas,

*   You can rewrite your content, improve it or even generate new content on a topic.
    
*   You can use it to quickly reply to your emails, messages, and social media posts.
    
*   You can even use it for creating presentations and generating excel formulas.
    
*   And now you can even define your own tasks with the ""Snippets"" feature.
    

Based on our user requests, I introduced the AI assistant to iOS devices (beta).

It follows the same philosophy, wherein you can use the writing assistant without leaving the app you are writing on.

So you can use an AI keyboard within Whatsapp, Mail, iMessage, etc.

Here's the demo of how the AI keyboard works -

[https://youtu.be/Y5vrH3Clgyo](https://youtu.be/Y5vrH3Clgyo)

There is a wide range of utility features built into the app to make your daily workflow smooth and fast with the power of AI.

**One last point**

The app is privacy friendly. You can use your own OpenAI keys, and none of your data is stored on our servers.

You can check out the tool on the website here -  [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rapple-sunday-promo-1202-02).

There are a whole lot of videos here in this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpv207Ven3s1Hmfcq9lqG74eRzJicbmoy).

**You can try the app for FREE for 30 days.**

I will appreciate your support and feedback.

Thanks.",1676211467.0
"There is something wrong with the Mouse, Cursor, and Magic Trackpad 2 in M1/M1*/M2 Macs.",542,110dozc,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/110dozc/there_is_something_wrong_with_the_mouse_cursor/,190,"This is gonna be quite a long post but **if you are also affected by the mouse cursor stuttering and jumping, either with the internal Trackpad or with the external Magic Trackpad 2 feel free to chime in and share your results, experiences, workarounds etc.** Anything that would help the community to overcome this issue.

&#x200B;

# Background

I bought my first arm-based Macbook Air 2 years ago as a backup device. My main workstation was still my Intel Mac. Whenever I used the M1, I noticed some cursor stutter after about 20 minutes of working or so. It's like the refresh rate for the cursor suddenly drops to like 24fps.

This is NOT the general slowdown that you experience when the CPU is busy or the memory is full. It can happen when doing nothing but clicking through items in the finder with nothing else ressource-hungry going on in the background,

What ""fixed"" it for a few minutes was to close the lid, open it again, maybe repeat that a few times and the cursor was back normal. This has already been discussed a lot in threads on Reddit and I'm surprised to find the exact same issues still being present after more than 2 years of arm Macs.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago I had to upgrade my main workstation (Intel MacBook) to an ARM-based Mac. I set up my Magic Trackpad on it. Of course, each new device can feel weird at first but after the first hour of using I noticed that I am still kind of unsuccessful at hitting buttons, marking text etc.

\- Everything felt imprecise,- the refresh rate would randomly drop like I know it from my 2020 backup mac,- additionally, the cursor would take random jumps of like 5cm/ 2 inches across the screen.

My productivity dropped as I had to second-guess and correct each cursor movement to get there where I wanted to get. My wrist started hurting on that very day (wrist joint issues were the reason I had to purchase a Magic Trackpad 2 a few years ago in first place and I absolutely loved the Trackpad ever since).

&#x200B;

# Radio?

I had somewhat similar issues when first moving to a USB-C Mac (the first Intel that required dongles for HDMI, USB etc.) when using a third-party dongle as this has disturbed the radio on the Mac. So back then I bought the original Apple dongle as well which solved these radio issues (also discussed in great extent across reddit).

This case here is not about radio tho, I also experience these issues when not being connected to an external screen, and not having the dongle plugged in.

&#x200B;

# Third party apps?

Some forum post said that third party apps cause this, so based on Apple Support's advice I went into safe mode and only used Safari for my work, no external screen, no other apps opened: Same results.

&#x200B;

# Comparison with Intel?

Thinking I'd go crazy I placed my old Intel mac at the exact same spot on my desk to see if this suffers the same problem. I was blown away at how smooth the Magic Trackpad cursor was on my Intel Mac. It felt like it had twice the refresh rate, twice the precision and none of the pain that comes with using the arm Mac. I need to mention that the Intel and the ARM Mac have the same apps installed because I transfered the whole installation from the Intel Mac to the ARM Mac.

&#x200B;

# Comparison with other Macs?

As I know the next step would be a replacement device, I was curious whether that would fix things. To cancel out any issues with apps on my ARM Mac, or with my ARM Mac's hardware even further, I've tried a few friends' ARM Macs (these friends also all know the cursor refresh rate issue on their ARM Mac but don't use a Magic Trackpad). Needless to say, the exact same issues started happening with my friends' computers as well. I attached my ""old"" arm backup Mac and the issue happened on that device as well. To give a short summary:

&#x200B;

\`\`\`

M1 Air 2020 on macOS 12.6: Problems

M2 Air 2022 on macOS 13.1: Problems

Intel Pro 2018 on macOS 12.6.2: NO Problems, smooth cursor

\`\`\`

(Tested with more devices too but this cancels out any macOS version issues)

&#x200B;

# Radio part 2 - connection via cable?

Then I found this thread:

[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253527363) (21 “Me too”)

For testing, I’ve connected the Trackpad via a lightning cable. It is way better that way. Is it possible that the radio in the MacBook Air M2 is much weaker or placed unfortunately? It really isn’t usable with the arm-based MacBooks.

However, the connection via cable isn't perfect either - While working, after a few days suddenly the cursor was unresponsive, the Trackpad couldn’t move or click for a few seconds. After that, it went back to being so wonky again, as if the cable wasn’t attached. Frame rate of the cursor also seemed lower and everything felt indirect. As if the mouse driver went into some kind of compatibility mode that doesn’t do any of the magic that cursor tracking usually involves. Like toggling mouse acceleration in Windows, it feels completely different and weird suddenly. As soon as that happened, I started mis-clicking buttons again because I constantly either overshoot cursor positions (like going past the button that I intended to click) or undershoot them (not reaching the desired cursor position in the first move). Temporarily moving to the Intel Mac, I hit everything as precise as I used to do. To cancel out any bias, I also did tests where I didn't know which device I was connected to and I could always tell the smoothness of the Intel vs the awful navigation in the ARM.

&#x200B;

# Internal Trackpad?

Apart from that, as mentioned in the beginning I also often see the cursor stuttering even with the inbuilt Trackpad. It’s like the refresh rate of the cursor drops:

# Trackpad / Radio / Cursor delay?

Additionally, I've taken slo mo recordings to measure the delay between my finger moving on the internal Trackpad + external Magic Trackpad and the cursor moving on screen with both processor architectures - I can't find any significant delays that way either. So it doesn't seem to be a latency issue.

&#x200B;

# Verdict

My best guess till now:

* ARM Macs have another set of mouse drivers, causing the refresh rate to drop
* ARM Macs have another set of mouse drivers that have different curves for interpolating and accelerating signals.
* ARM Macs have some additional radio issues, that don't cause all of the problems, but add to them

In any case, my wrist hurts. Doing the lightning cable thing already helps a lot but I still need to restart the computer every few days due to the above-mentioned issue of the cursor messing up even on lightning. Also, even with the cable attached, it still doesn't feel as direct and smooth as on the Intel Mac.

&#x200B;

# How to go from here?

I've spent way too much time on this problem already but I'm required to use a macOS device for work and right now it looks like I will have some bad time ahead in the next few years if there is no solution in sight. If you have any info to share, let's work together to be either to either find a workaround, or gather enough information so Apple can finally acknowledge the problem and address it.",1676201548.0

I hope/suspect Apple isn't letting another AI opportunity slip,63,10ywq5a,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10ywq5a/i_hopesuspect_apple_isnt_letting_another_ai/,179,"**Generative AI**  is here to stay and change our way of living once again. They’re in their infancy, but getting better very rapidly. Big tech companies understand this new AI as a massive part of all our futures. Staking a claim and building a leadership position is as important as dominating the web was in the 90s.

Microsoft announced a new conversational search feature you can start using right now in Bing AND the Edge browser. Google on the other hand just shot themselves in the food with panicking and rushing their Bard thing. 

**Where is apple in all of this?**

Apple has the tools to build its own generative AI with the Neural Engine built into iPhone and Mac chips that is capable of up to 15.8 trillion operations per second, along with Core ML and machine learning APIs. After all, apple spearheaded AI once with Siri....But we haven’t seen any movement jet

***Conclusion:*** Apple has positioned itself as a technology leader for years now. I don't think they are so badly lead, that apple will give that up! Of course, Apple is one of the most secretive companies in tech, especially when it comes to software. Apple could have big teams working hard to bring generative AI features soon. (They bought at least o ne generative AI company: AI Music) I hope we get a surprise at a coming WWDC: World-class generative AI all over Apple’s products! (I really hope that’s the case, because if they are late to the game on such a transformational technology, it’s going to doom its software to being years behind its competitors)

iPhone users - do you want RCS?,132,10yh4z1,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10yh4z1/iphone_users_do_you_want_rcs/,263,"If Apple were to adopt RCS would you find it beneficial? Do you text enough friends/family with Androids that it would excite you? 

Genuinely curious if iOS users have any desire for the feature. Clearly Tim Cook doesn’t think so.

Edit 1: Results:

So based on the feedback we have a pretty mixed bag. 

1) Majority of folks are open to it as long as it’s not overseen by Google (none of you use a Gmail already??). Which makes the most sense to me, Apple will always do it the Apple way and would find a way to have full control over it as they always do imo. 

2) lots of you (mainly Europeans) who could care less either way. I envy you, it would be nice if this didn’t even need to be a conversation. Please feel free to convince anyone in NA to download 1-2 messaging apps to accommodate android users… you’ll understand our pain. 

3) smaller portion of the crowd are in the hard no camp. Main reason seems to be Googles involvement or no reasoning given. 

Interesting spread of results. I sit in the camp of why not improve the experience for all users regardless of platform if there is a clear roadmap on how to do it? Not saying RCS in its current form is the final best option, but it’s a foundation that can be built on.",1676006523.0

Heads up: New iPhone and Watch trade in boxes can cause confusion,66,10xd7br,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10xd7br/heads_up_new_iphone_and_watch_trade_in_boxes_can/,14,"I just wanted to share here a new issue that I dealt with this year, that I haven’t previously experienced, to hopefully save someone else the trouble.

Previously when I had traded in my iPhone and Watch, I recall the boxes being a bit different. This year I traded in both, and I received two boxes that to me were identical. They both had instructions for the phone and watch, I recall no clear marking to indicate which was which. I’ll tell you why this mattered.

I accepted a trade in of my phone for $550, and $155 for my watch. Apparently, I mixed up the boxes (still not knowing how I could have known the difference). This resulted in my phone being sent as trade in for the watch, and my watch being sent as trade in for the phone.

Now since I had sent a $550 device in place of a trade in for a $155 device, Apple sent me a gift card for the difference. Since I sent in a $155 device in place of a trade in for a $550 device, Apple had to charge me the difference.

So I ended up having to pay extra out of pocket than originally planned, and the only saving grace is that I now have an Apple gift card for the difference. Which isn’t really what I wanted, I wasn’t planning on spending any more money in their store for a few months.

I apologize if this is hard to follow, but the PSA here is this: If you trade in a phone and a watch at the same time, be VERY sure you know which box is for which, because if you get it wrong the whole process is super confusing and you’ll pay more than you intended to.",1675895918.0

Will Siri ever become more intelligent?,386,10x2b95,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10x2b95/will_siri_ever_become_more_intelligent/,257,"As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, one question that has been on many people's minds is whether or not Siri will ever become more intelligent. Apple has been quiet about their releases and advancements, but with Microsoft and Google both releasing advanced AI models for search, it begs the question: what could Apple be working on?

There are several probable scenarios in which Apple has a chance to take the lead in the AI race. For one, they have already made significant advancements in on-device processing, which could serve as a foundation for further improvements. They have also announced an AI Summit event later this year. Additionally, Apple has a reputation for keeping their cards close to their chest, so it's possible that they are silently working on something revolutionary.

The competition in the AI space is fierce, with Microsoft and Google both making giant steps forward in recent months. It's not just a battle between these two tech giants, though, and many people are hoping that Apple will soon join the fray. Bing's reawakening and Google Bard's offering coming up to everyone. 

The future of AI is uncertain, but one thing is for sure: the competition is heating up. Whether or not Apple will be able to go to the next level remains to be seen, but the advancements being made by other companies serve as a reminder of the gigantic steps that companies have to take in order to stay ahead of the game. It kind of feels like 10 years ago when we had a new smartphone release every week... we tried all kinds of new UI features, and the iOS vs Android war was full steam, I'm excited to see what's gonna happen!

What do you think? Will Siri ever become more intelligent? How do you see Apple fitting into the AI landscape in the future? Let's have a discussion!",1675872062.0

Apple Health & Fitness future?,17,10vh6ue,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10vh6ue/apple_health_fitness_future/,17,"Hey everyone,

As someone who recently switched to Apple ecosystem, I am trying to learn more about the products and how to build up my ecosystem with meaningful additions. The way I do it is that I search for the products and examine their current state / features and what is coming. In general I am really satisfied with my MBP and iPhone.

However, as a pervious Garmin Epix2 owner (now AWU), this is where I feel Apple lacks the most and thought it wouldn't be the case. I am not an extreme athlete, I don't need GPS tracking or outdoor stuff trackings - I am dude that goes to gym, doing strength training. So in terms of 'workout' support, I am not that interested in that.

What I find Garmin does way better is the features like: Stress Management, Body Battery, Readiness Score , Morning Report, Step counting, and ..  most interesting to me, Insights. 

At the moment, I have following Apps: Autosleep, HeartWatch and Athlytic (+ Centr for Fitness App). There is no Fitness+ in my country. I did pay for the premium, but I still find it lacklustre, compared to Garmin or even Fitbit (I tested Pixel Watch for a while). 

I do not like the idea of having soo many third party apps, but if they would provide me with data the way I imagine Apple would do (nice UI/UX, straight to the point, no need to be data scientist to understand insights, etc.), I'd be completely fine with that.

So I came here wondering, if any of you have any info on what is Apple's plan in regards to Health & Fitness features? I learned that they have a dedicated executive role for Apple Health, so I would assume they would make big leaps here - but couldn't find any info on roadmaps or future features.

Did I do my research poorly and the apps I chose are simply not the best for this? Then I would be happy to test some you would suggest for me. For me, I don't need lots of raw data, but rather explanation of data and what can I do about it or what does it tell me about me / my pattern.

  
Examples:

\- You had only 10min of deep sleep. It is advisable to have X amount for your age and goals. Try going to sleep at Y time and do \*this\* before going to bed.

\- You did only 100 steps so far. It is recommended to do at least XXXX steps per day. To target that goal  you need need to do 250 steps per hour. Get moving now! (And it would actually track steps, not the 'Stand Time' like Apple Watch does).

\- Your HRV was quite low during the night and your RHR was a bit increased. It seems you did not get enough rest during the night, so track your readiness score throughout the day. If you would like to exercise today, try having a nap in afternoon.

\- etc.

Now it could be AutoSleep  / Athlytic / HeartWatch does say that SOMEWHERE amidst tons of numbers and data, but I would like to have it as an 'Insight' section or a Push notification.",1675715316.0

What’s up with Apple’s design choices in recent years?,9,10vpg8q,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10vpg8q/whats_up_with_apples_design_choices_in_recent/,19,"They’re just all over the place it seems like, between being unsure of what color schemes to stick with (see Mac desktop models in primary pastel colors vs. iPhone/iPad/watch/Macbook colors remaining pretty much neutral/industrial) and the fact that Apple cannot decide on what screen bezel design they want to move towards, where is the consistency?
Like most of the industry at this point, they are trying to move away from notched phones and towards fullscreen-ish designs, but while introducing the dynamic island design to iPhones/just starting to move away from the notch, they’re now implementing the notch in previously-fullscreen Macbook models—all while the iPad has moved to a bezeled fullscreen design. Additionally, Apple is still pushing the square-edged iPhone/iPads while the watch line still retains the pill-shaped bodies of older iPhone models, seen from the iPhone 6 to 11 models.

Does this inconsistency seem apparent to anyone else or am I just nitpicking? How do you feel about the trends in Apple’s design choices of recent years?",1675735731.0

I’m looking for a bunch of ideas and suggestions on what I can do with my new computer. For some context, it’s my first Mac. I had a PC like 10 years ago and finally needed to update and since everything else I have is in the ecosystem I went with a MacBook this time. 

I’d love to learn new things such as coding, whether it be in app development or in data science. I have friends that do both and it seems interesting and fun. I have started to get into photography as well, I have a 13 Pro and I love taking photos with it. I do a lot of cooking and frequently write down my recipes and take photos in case I ever want to create content. 

What do you guys use your MacBooks for? What programs do you recommend? Any specific courses for improving my skills or learning new ones? I’m in my mid-late 20’s, don’t even work in my degree, and might be looking to move to a new city, so if I get good at any of this stuff I’ll definitely switch it up haha. 

Thanks for your help everyone!

Edit: To everyone telling me to cancel the order, half the cost of this was covered so I’m paying 2 grand for a 4k machine. I’m not cancelling, I’d rather have an overpowered machine that I can learn to utilize in time rather than one that I’ll need to upgrade again later.

On the Android side all anyone seems to care about are foldables, and now each OEM is really trying to make their own ""thing"". Pixel wants AI, computational photography and automation to be its thing, and these are useful, but far from earth shattering. It all just doesn't feel as exciting as it once was, everything is plateauing. I'm so bored looking at benchmarks and tiny little tweaks to numbers.

I'm curious to see where you all think the industry is going? Are phones simply an upgrade every 2-3 years now thing or is the industry going to rock itself again? Has the industry matured and have we reached (or are near) peak smartphone?",1675655951.0

I created a Smart Diary that allows you to have your own AI. Called Moolight - Smart Diary,143,10ub8we,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10ub8we/i_created_a_smart_diary_that_allows_you_to_have/,45,"[Download Moolight - Smart Diary](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/moodlight-intelligent-note/id1631169735)

Instead of writing a long journal, I love taking short notes throughout the day, in a bullet point format. In this way, I could better record the thoughts that could otherwise be forgotten.

My girlfriend writes diary every day. The problem she had is that after writing for years, there is no good way to see the changes in yourself, even though all texts are there.

We tried very hard to search for an app that could fit our need. But failed. **As a result, we took a lot of time to learn and develop our first take on this idea. Of a smart note app.**

**Moolight** is our answer. It features an on-device AI that could help us organize the piece of ideas into 15 categories. And try to provide some insights and feedbacks from all the notes automatically.

We don't want to sacrifice any privacy, as a result, a decision is made to keep all data to yourself & your own iCloud. After tested out the idea, we found a way to make it even smarter and fit your own record style. As a result, you could train your absolutely unique AI on your device in Moolight.

The more you write and correct the category, the better your own AI gets. In our own test, with the default AI, the accuracy is about 70% correctness. If you write for about 20 days with 5 bullet points per day, and correct the category. Your could own a unique AI that do chores sorting out your notes 100% categories correctness for all your notes.

&#x200B;

**Why bother creating another note app?**

Complex tools makes it's easy to get lost. When using simple tools, the notes could easily scattered everywhere. Why can't software help? We live in an age when technology advances every day, yet the software for notes seem to become unchanged since long time ago.

That's why we spent long time, realizing this idea. And had great fun developing this product. The idea is about writing without being disturbed. Enjoy the ease of use brought by technological advances while having absolute privacy.

&#x200B;

**Design Thoughts**

My girlfriend is a data scientist, and I had background in software and design. We wanna to combine our experiences, and attempt to give this idea our best effort. Since day one, we discussed and settled on the following ground rules:

1. We believe everyone should be the sole owner of our data, especially in a case for note or diary. So data never leaves your device or iCloud. All data should be processed on-device with neural engine. It should be 100% functional when offline.
2. We wanna it to be smart, to make life easier. To do this, it should know how we feel when we write; It should know the realtime weather so my gf don't need to type in manually; It should know I'm writing about food, without specifying the category. It should be able to track anything that we ever want to know if we wrote about it.
3. We wanna it to be able to think. To write a short headline each day and help us recall. It should know the top content I'm constantly writing about, and use my data to give us some feedback. We wanna it know them all, yet do not ask for any information besides what I actually write.

&#x200B;

**Why there are three tabs?**

Today, Gallery and Insights.

The idea is that whenever you want to write something, it's in the Today tab, this is where you focus on the moment. When you want to have a look at the past. All the information is well organized and truthfully present to you in Gallery tab.

We can't predict the future. However, in some way, we could also get a glimpse of idea about future based on what we were doing in the past. This is what Insights tab do.

▶ Today ◀ • Bullet Based Input • Automatic added Weather & Location • Mood Lights to Know Your Feeling • Time Travel to Past and Future • Dynamic Background that Flows.

▶ Gallery ◀ • Refined Card with Mood Color • Daily Auto Headline • Auto Classification for Each Input • Powerful Search by Time and Types.

▶ Insights ◀• Cumulative Days, and Inputs Count • Weekly Glance to be Surprised • Keyword to Know What Mattered • Track Anything as Tags • Know What made you Happy with Mood Trend • Random Show to Recall Memories • Mapped Journey to Mark your Path • Liked/Web Records to Shortcut • Customize Modules on Your Preference.

• iCloud Sync and Backup for iPhone/iPad/Mac • Face ID for Additional Safety • Customize Color, Typography, etc • Recycled Bin for Accidental Delete • Automatic Light and Dark Mode.

&#x200B;

**What can it do?**

**• Intelligent Classification**

Declutter the life events. Work, Food, Study and so on. It just knows.

**• Understand Your Mood**

How’s your day? Moolight will do the best guess.

**• Multiple Organizers**

Event, Emotions, Keywords, Maps, etc. Multiple ways to visualize the data.

&#x200B;

Since it's unlike any existing note or diary product in the market. It takes time to get familiar with Moolight, and once you get familiar with it, hopefully you'll grow the love of it like we did. Moolight is released to the App Store on the first day of 2023. And we're still trying very hard to polish it.

Would love to hear your thoughts about it.",1675599818.0

PSA: Don’t let Apple deny your request to update Date of Purchase for a brand new previous-gen product. Had to escalate to manager level to get them to do it.,293,10ss2fb,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10ss2fb/psa_dont_let_apple_deny_your_request_to_update/,45,"Just got off the phone with Apple in what was an super frustrating experience from a company that brags about its consumer-friendly policy. 

I just bought a Series 6 from an online retailer just last week and set it up today. After set up, I noticed that it said “Coverage Expired”. Weird but no biggie, I’ll just call Apple and it’ll be sorted out soon. Or so I thought. 

First CSR asked me to provide proof of payment which I gladly did. I even screenshared my phone to show the receipt in my email. He asked me to upload my screenshots. No problemo. He then transfers me to another CSR.

I’m 20 minutes into what I thought would be 5 mins. The second CSR informs me that due to the fact that it’s a Series 6 they can’t update the Date of Purchase. Excuse me? I bought it brand new from a reputable retailer (Sportchek). It wasn’t open box or anything. The box was sealed. The CSR gives me this gem: because the AW was shipped to the retailer in 2020, they cannot update the Date of Purchase. 

This was shocking to hear. I told her that it doesn’t matter to me as the end consumer when a product was shipped to the retailer. I bought it new and they have to honour the manufacturer’s warranty. She transfers me to her manager. 

I’m now 45 minutes into this call. Manager gets on the phone and asks me what the issue was. I explained how I’m being told that Apple does not cover its own new products just because of when they were shipped to a retailer. She apologizes and agrees with me and goes ahead and approves the update to the Date of Purchase. Finally!! 

Took me almost an hour on the phone to get done what should have never been an issue in the first place. So DO NOT let Apple reject your request to update the Date of Purchase if you bought a NEW Apple product. Consumer laws exist to protect the end users from this sort of bs.",1675450578.0

Discussion: The friction between using an iPhone and Windows Computer,13,10rwgvj,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10rwgvj/discussion_the_friction_between_using_an_iphone/,9,"I have an iPhone. I also have a Windows PC at home and use a Windows PC at work. I use the Windows PC at work because I must, and I use the Windows PC at home because it’s a requirement for my online Business Administration Degree. Additionally, I've always liked Windows because it's what I'm used to. 

Most of my personal life is on my iPhone. The native calendar, reminder, and notes app all seamlessly connect to help me manage my life and be productive. I have notes integrated with the reminders app and reminders set out way into the future. This runs my life.

I’m really loving using Windows more and more every day. Whether it’s for school, work, or for personal use. The programs I’ve used are so feature rich. They’re a pleasure to use and find out all the possible capabilities that can help me be productive. Lately, I’ve been learning more and more about Excel and OneNote. It’s honestly been fun and I’m enjoying myself quite a bit.

This leads me to a point of friction. I love using Windows App’s on my PC, but my whole life is wrapped up on an iPhone which I also enjoy. The webpages for iPhone apps are quite garbage (looking at you Apple Notes). I’m considering making the switch from Apple to Windows and migrating all my notes and reminders to Windows apps. 

My question is this: Is it worth it? For those with an iPhone and Windows PC, which apps do you use to manage your personal life? Are you frustrated with the limitations? More generally, what is your workflow?",1675361443.0

**Video description:** Some are arguing that the new 2nd Gen HomePod could be a tough sell for Apple, but I've always wondered if a stereo pair of HomePods could make a formidable system. Is a pair of new Apple HomePods good enough to best soundbars and other powered speakers as a full home entertainment or home theater system?

The next version of AirPods Max need to be substantially better.,15,10q4nbj,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10q4nbj/the_next_version_of_airpods_max_need_to_be/,42,"I've been using my wired headphone setup and APP2's for a while and decided to put on my dusty APM's to see how it sounds. The noise cancelling is significantly better on the APP2's. Also, the APP2's are lighter, have more battery life, have a case that makes sense, and they sound better. The Max has a more distant-sounding soundstage, but not wider than the AirPod Pro's. Apple has their work cut out for them for the next version of the Max. I don't think I would recommend the current version if it was sold for $200. They can't be selling many units as the product stands in the market right now.",1675185389.0

I just made the switch to Apple silicon with an M2 Max MBP and holy moly am I not disappointed! On the contrary. I can do Android builds, iOS builds, typescript builds, you name it, and this freaking machine doesn’t even get warm!

I also use a high resolution ultra wide screen and that alone was heating up my previous MBP due to the strain on the GPU.

Before, even video calls would have the fans blow like crazy. Now I have yet to find a task that makes the M2 sweat even a little bit. 

I know I’m late to the party but this has been the best buy machine-wise in a long while.

"I've just released Pestle 1.4 with Smart Folders, PDF Import, Image Import and more!",142,10o90rl,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10o90rl/ive_just_released_pestle_14_with_smart_folders/,44,"Hey r/Apple! 

I'm Will, a 20-year-old developer from Adelaide, Australia. I build [Pestle, an intelligent recipe manager for iPhone & iPad](https://apple.co/3sWeyWl) (The Mac version is coming along well, and it will be worth the wait!).

If you're not already familiar with Pestle, [checkout the launch post from 6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/sgctww/ive_just_released_pestle_transform_any_recipe/). But in short, Pestle is a Recipe Organiser that lets you save recipes from any website.

# Smart Folders

This is one is really cool! Pestle now has 'Smart Folders', which fill themselves up based on the criteria you set. Want to filter your 400 recipes down to just 4-star or higher desserts that aren't alcoholic beverages? Easy! As you save new recipes to Pestle, they'll automatically be added to your Smart Folders.

# PDF Import

This one is for those of you with Cookbooks as PDFs. Pestle can now show you your PDF Cookbook and will guide you through adding your favourites to Pestle. Once saved, Pestle will use its smarts to enable you to scale recipes, convert them, and more. 

# Image Import

Much like PDF Importing, Pestle can now handle photos you've taken of recipe cards and the like, with Live Text on iOS 16, scanning photos into Pestle is a breeze.

### Search Improvements

This is a smaller one, but worth a mention. Sometimes when searching across your large collection, exactly _why_ a recipe shows up might not be clear. You may search for ""Italian"", and a recipe with ""Italian Herbs"" will show up. Now search results will show in the top right exactly _why_ they're there, like ""Matches Ingredient"" or ""Main Course"".

# Privacy First

Frankly, it's none of my business what you cook with Pestle, where you share it to, etc etc. That's why the [Privacy Policy](https://pestlechef.app/privacy) is so short, there's very little for me to say. First and foremost, **Pestle does not collection identifiable information** (with the only exception of your email, if you even consider that identifiable, and also only **if you use email signup**, if you use Sign In with Apple/Google, then this doesn’t apply. For analytical purposes, I do track daily active users, version breakdowns and such. **But none of this information is tracked back to you, it is 100% anonymous**. I use [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com), a privacy-focused platform use by many other popular apps, such as Apollo for Reddit.


That sums up this update, it's my biggest update since releasing Live Activities (among other things), so I hope you like it :)

I would love for you to give it a try, so go get [Pestle on the App Store](https://apple.co/3sWeyWl)!",1675002888.0
If you travel often using public transit you might find Glarm useful.

If you’re like me and you travel a lot by train, or bus you might not always recognize railway stations or tell quickly how far is your stop, so you start nervously checking the time and position on the map.

With Glarm you can set alarm to ring, let’s say 5 kilometres from your destination and in the meantime, take a nap, or watch a movie without worrying about missing the stop.

**It was recently updated with support for Live Activities on iOS 16** so now you can track the distance from the destination on your lock screen.

"I just released Oolong v2, a ""future forward"" budget app that can help you control the ""shape"" of your money!",70,10o7g9n,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10o7g9n/i_just_released_oolong_v2_a_future_forward_budget/,28,"Hey /r/apple, 

Just launched Oolong *v2* after two years of doing other... stuff 🙈

#### [GET IT HERE](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1549289924)

---

**TL;DR:** 

Oolong is a ""future forward"" budget app that helps users control the ""shape"" of their money. Whereas other apps like Mint, YNAB, and [Envy](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/q5dd4a/i_created_a_budgeting_app_that_doesnt_collect_any/) are great at helping users understand ""what happened"", Oolong is all about predicting ""what *will* happen"" so that you can make smarter financial decisions **today**.

---

**What's New?**

Oolong is the reason I picked up iOS development 3 years ago. The [original app](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/) was, admittedly pretty basic, but it got the job done! This latest version is everything that I've learned a lot about building enterprise apps over these last couple years along with: 

- Completely new design (as requested by [/u/Darpyface](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glj008n/))
- Balance Sheets and Income Statements
- Multiple Accounts (as requested by [/u/John-McAfee](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/glicfor/))
- Decimals! (as requested by [/u/lizadting](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/l9cx4o/just_released_my_second_indie_app_oolong_a_budget/gli07qb/))

---

**Use cases**

I've been using the Oolong methodology for over a decade (then just an Excel spreadsheet). It's the singular tool that I use to manage my money. Hearing from several v1 users, many have used Oolong to: 

- Figure out how much to allocate to savings/investments
- Plan major one-time purchases
- Figure out ""how much apartment"" to rent/buy

---

**Freemium**

Oolong is free for the first 3 accounts (assets/liabilities) and 7 plan items (incomes/transfers/expenses). An ""In App Upgrade"" can be purchased to unlock unlimited accounts and plan items, as well as remove ads.

I really think that Oolong can help users escape the ""paycheck-to-paycheck"" trap. So, if you use and love Oolong, but can't afford the upgrade right now, please send me a quick email at oolong@bracket.ltd with a little explanation about how you hope to use Oolong to improve finances and I'll endeavour to send you a code!

"Is this the Mandela effect, or did Apple announce wireless Bluetooth or NCF tags for retailers around 2015?",597,10nvn0a,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10nvn0a/is_this_the_mandela_effect_or_did_apple_announce/,156," I've tried looking into this for a little while and I can find no trace of it on the internet.

I swear I have a memory from probably around 2015 of a WWDC video where Tim Cook was advertising NFC/Bluetooth/similar devices to brick and mortar retailers. I cant remember what their value proposition was, but it provided some digital services to customers.  Maybe you download apps, order online, or similar - basically a glorified QR code. Sorry, my memory is very patchy.

Outside of the mention at the WWDC, I have no other memory of it (never saw it on their website, in person, etc). That, plus me being unable to figure out an actual use case for this product, plus not being able to find anything about it on the internet is making me thinking I've just made this up!

Does anyone else remember anything like this, or have I lost the plot!?

What is the purpose of making a service appointment?,17,10nld96,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10nld96/what_is_the_purpose_of_making_a_service/,12,"A week ago I made an appointment to get my battery changed. The price is being hiked in March, and my phone is a few years old still on the original battery. May as well change it before the price hike as it is noticeably weaker. (On my 6s I'd change the battery myself, but honestly I cba to replace iphone batteries myself now). 

So I made an appointment online, where I input that I was coming in for a battery replacement, the day I wanted, the store I would be at, and the type of phone I have. I even got the email & text reminder about my appointment this morning, so I drive to the Apple store, get checked in, wait for a staff member to be available, start the initial info gathering part of the process.......just to be told the store doesnt have my battery in stock, and they would have to order it and wait 3-5 business days.

What was the point of the appointment?!? They knew when I was coming in, they knew what store I was going to, they knew what type of battery I needed. Seriously, instead of a reminder email & text why couldn't I have gotten a message saying we don't have the battery yet, don't bother coming in. Why is the battery only being ordered now...AFTER I came in, not when I booked the appointment (Ya know, more than 3-5 business days ago).

The ""most innovative tech company"" can't even link their appointment schedule with the Apple stores? Not even like I was at a third party repair center, it was an official Apple store...

Universal control appreciation post,23,10mtglg,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10mtglg/universal_control_appreciation_post/,13,"So this is an upvote for universal control and a downvote for M2 MBA only supporting 1 external display.

Two things to know about me: 

1. I have been wanting 3 screens. Was really frustrated about the M2 MBA not supporting 2 externals. 
2. I have been trying to keep work / personal stuff separate 

Now I have a set up where the two laptops are mounted on either side of my monitor. I have 3 screens!! I also can control both personal and work with one set of mouse/keyboard which is great.

Never ever ever get AppleCare through Best Buy Total Tech,554,10mzzht,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10mzzht/never_ever_ever_get_applecare_through_best_buy/,170,"AppleCare + Best Buy=weeks of waiting

Do NOT get Best Buy Total Tech for your iPhone or, probably any apple product. These two companies need to acknowledge that the relationship isn’t working and it is at the customer’s expense. Honestly, Best Buy, he or she is not that into you, move on. And customers- neither is interested in you, you’re just in a custody battle.

On 1/3 I brought my beyond repairable iPhone into Best Buy for repair. I have Total Tech with Apple Care so it was fully covered. That all sounds good but what happens after is the most maddening b.s. 

1) The person I talked to at the Geeksquad counter looked at my phone, could see it is well beyond repair and said they could not take the phone in because I would need to make a Geeksquad appointment because they need to “run diagnostics to see if it is covered by Total Tech AppleCare”. It is. Is this something I can look up online on my account myself? He says, “Yes, you can do that.” This makes no sense then why an appointment is needed to determine that because if I can look it up (and I already had), why can’t the Geek Squad dude standing in Best Buy who has my account pulled up in his Best Buy computer not find this information himself? But I don’t want to make his life difficult because whatever they have going on for an inefficient system isn’t his fault. I ask if I can get in for that appointment that day or evening. No. It will be 3 days. Wait three days for them to look up my Apple Care. WTF. Ok, corporate bullshit has me waiting a few days.

2) 3 days later I make the time to drive back over there again with the same issue-need the phone replaced. The person at the counter this time is more helpful to the degree they can be. She is like, “I don’t know why they made you wait and make an appointment we can just do this right here.” She says she worked in the phone section but that they don’t cross train which leads to that stuff—As in being required to make an appointment to verify AppleCare coverage. And my Geeks Squad appointment says customer want to verify Apple Care coverage as my reason for the appointment. Um. NO, I DON’T, I want to move the repairs forward. I let her know that I appreciated her help and thought it seemed excessive to have to go in twice, 3 days apart just for that. She processed the phone, could see it is unrepairable and charged me for a replacement. She says it may be up to THREE WEEKS for them to replace. The phone but it does get overnight shipped both ways. Ok. So I have to use an old phone that does not get texts from almost numbers, that does not get data because my SIM is 5G and the phone is 4g. But, it’s temporary, it’ll be fine. It is, however, my work phone so I have to tell everybody that I do not get texts nor do I have data.

3) Days pass. Weeks pass. I go to AppleCare to find out what is going on. There is no record of a repair for my phone with them because they run it all through Best Buy and cut the customer out. You cannot talk to ANYONE at Apple because they have no record of your repairin their system. This leaves tracking a repair through Best Buy. When that happens it simply says, “We are moving forward with your repair’ or some unhelpful sentence like. No timeline, no deadline, no contact info. 

4) I am now 25 days in from the start of this. I decide to call the store to speak to a human. Instead it’s AI that tells me the phone attached to my number is currently in repair. OMG I KNOW THIS.  I say I want to talk to a person and AI tells me it “understands” I want to talk to someone and the wait will be 7 minutes. 5 minutes in someone answers. BUT it is clear I have been forwarded to a call center.  I explain what I want to know, they tell me they will see what is going on.  Hold. They return to tell me that my phone is being repaired.  That is so inadequate. I KNOW THIS. I want more accountability on that end- what is going on, give me a date, etc. He tells me I should call the store and would I like the number.. No- because that is where I called and got sent out to them.  

5) Today I go in to Best Buy again. They apologize and say they are unable to talk to any human being there and are only able to escalate the order and they say they have been doing it every other day and, will now, on day 24, start doing it daily. And they tell me this is typical of Apple with them.

DO NOT GET TOTALTECH for your Apple device. Pretty sure Apple deprioritizes their Best Buy work, Best Buy gets your Total Tech money so they don’t care as it is still profitable for them and you are out your device for weeks on end, with zero accountability on either company’s end.

Spouses sharing iCloud accounts,0,10m99ue,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10m99ue/spouses_sharing_icloud_accounts/,34,"Hello there reddappleiverse… My wife and I have been using the same iCloud account (my email) on all our Apple devices since 2009 mainly because that was the only way to share purchases (before family support) and share a single iCloud photo library (before iCloud Shared Photo Library). We keep our messages/FaceTime separate just by unchecking the other phone number unchecked in settings and never giving out the Apple ID email as a way to be messaged/called. We like that we can use “find my” to ding either of our devices which I do for her a few times a week. However, it has some annoyances like bugs where it shows missed calls to the other number, and messaging business chat shows up on both devices. Other than that, it generally works fine and we are used to it, but I have 2 questions for the hive mind:
1.	Does anyone else still do this? Are there some other benefits I might not be realizing?
2.	Splitting them seems like a good idea but a huge pain. Can someone talk me out of this? Anyone successfully completed a split like this?",1674785274.0
"Security keys, 2FA, account recovery testing",135,10mgr5l,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10mgr5l/security_keys_2fa_account_recovery_testing/,50,"I did some testing with and without security keys…

**Scenario**: 2FA enabled, Advanced Data Protection Enabled, Recovery Key set, 2 Recovery Contacts set  
   
Apple ID password reset - there are 3 options:  
1.	 You must HAVE unlocked trusted device AND must KNOW device passcode and then you can change password in settings (can be secured more by blocking Account changes with different pin) 
  

2.	You must KNOW a trusted phone number AND must HAVE unlocked trusted device to get pushed 6 digit code to reset remotely


3.	You must KNOW a trusted phone number AND must HAVE it to receive SMS verification code/call AND must KNOW your icloud recovery key
 

Logging in - there are two options:  
1.	Must KNOW password ; must HAVE unlocked trusted device
2.	Must KNOW password ; must HAVE working trusted phone number for SMS/Call
               


!!! Note I couldn't see a way to use Recovery Contacts.  Apple says having a Recovery Key set means Account Recovery is disabled, originally I thought this would just disable the manual Account Recovery that happens when you phone apple up about it - but it doesn't make it clear this means Recovery Contacts don't work. [edit] However the Recovery Key or Recovery Contacts are still very likely important for recovering end to end encryption keys for iCloud. 


___

 
**New scenario**: As above but with 2 Security Keys set as well  
 
  
Apple ID password reset - there is maybe 1 actual option:  
  
1.	You must HAVE an unlocked trusted device AND must KNOW device passcode to use settings menu to change password

2.	iforgot.apple.com - pushes a notification to your trusted devices which takes you to do #1 above...  or you can alternatively get instructions for #3. It does not apply 6 digit code etc. 

3.	Tells you to use Apple Support app etc.  When I try this currently it asks to confirm my phone number, and then takes me to a ""Security Key Verification - To reset your password, verify one of your security keys."" screen.  But this is immediately popped over with a ""Cannot verify identity - Your action could not be completed because of a server error. Try again."" message before I even have time to try to scan a key.  Maybe its suspicious because of all the fooling around I've been doing. This is where IMO it should allow you to HAVE the security key and KNOW the recovery key. 

4.	With the SAME factors as #1 you can also remove all the security keys from your account and remove the restrictions in place but this isn't really a separate option as its the same factors…
  
!!! So in this configuration, if correct, your account is GONE if a) you can't unlock a trusted device AND b) you forgot your icloud password. As above I don't feel this is correct - you should be able to HAVE a Security Key + KNOW the Recovery Key.  That said, this scenerio should be very rare?  And anybody who loses all their devices and forgets their icloud password is pretty unlikely to know their recovery key :P
  
!!!Your account is NOT lost if you lose all your security keys - see #4 above you can just delete them if you have the factors for #1  

The Recovery Key or Recovery contacts can’t seem to help you reset the password in this scenario, however they are still important to recover end to end encryption keys for iCloud data. 

  
Logging in there is only one option:  
                Must KNOW password ; must HAVE one of your security keys (or see #4 above)  
                (that said, I only tested this on icloud.com, didn't try logging in to a new device because pain but I suspect its the same...)
 
  
Google will let you have security keys plus other forms of two factor. However if you turn Google advanced protection on, then it also reverts to only allowing security keys as the second factor. But you can set a recovery contact that they warn will take several days to process.",1674811319.0

BUT after spending this week tying to collaborate with my partner on a house we're building (layouts, floor plan, dimensions, lists, etc.) in Freeform, I find myself disappointed over how much is lacking. 

I'm hoping Apple adds a lot more power and functionality in the future. 

Primarily, I would love 

* the ability to change the dimensions of shapes (like one can do in Numbers, Keynote, Pages)
* change background color, grid, grid type, etc. 
* hold down hand-drawn lines / shapes and have them snap into the shape 
* snap hand drawn lines or shapes to the grid 
* be able to select more than just hand drawn lines 
* be able to select / move / scale / rotate / duplicate groups of objects

Heads up RE: Apple Studio Display,0,10l5n0z,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10l5n0z/heads_up_re_apple_studio_display/,10,"I just bought two Apple Studio displays. I ordered them with a Mac Studio Max and an M2 Air but the computers will arrive in a few weeks and the Studio Displays are here now. I am currently using an iMac 27"" from 2017. My iMac is connected to an OWC Thunderbay4 which holds four 6TB drives. That is chained to another Thunderbay4 with 4 backup  drives. The second Thunderbay is chained to an OWC dock to which I have two fast NVME ssd's for video editing. I connected my new Apple Studio Display to the iMac's second Thunderbolt port and booted it. It was a no go for the display. Studio Displays must be connected directly to the Mac and they have only one Tbolt port (and four USB-C Gen 2 ports).  It can't be chained. Previously my iMac had a different display connected to my OWC dock but the Apple display can't do that, nor could it boot if my other port on the imac was so heavily used. It turns out (an hour and a half with Apple techs that have sent the issue to the engineers) that - apparently - the Apple Display is power intensive (in spite of it's own power cord) and can't deal with the iMac's Thunderbolt setup. The iMac shares a single controller between the two Tbolt ports. I have learned if I boot my iMac with  the display connected to one thunderbolt on my iMac and then add just one Thunderbay and after that add the other Thunderbay with the attached dock, then it's all good and stable but the display will not turn on if I boot with everything attached.  My 16"" M1 Macbook Pro Max will deal with all of this attached at the same time so I am assuming the Mac Studio Max will also since the 4 Tbolts on the Studio  are independent.    Thought I'd clue folks in so since I mistakenly assumed my Studio displays could be easily connected like my previous Eizo display was. BTW...the complaints about the Studio Display's web cam were warranted. I'll be buying a decent web cam. Just horrible. Worse than my old iMac.",1674671124.0

Apple should have an all Mac event,0,10kxo0w,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10kxo0w/apple_should_have_an_all_mac_event/,9,"To me it would seem obvious for Apple to have two stacked events a year (or every other year for Macs) with a 1st quarter event for all things Mac (Mac mini, Mac Studio, Mac Pro, iMac, MacBook, Air, Pro, and accessories like displays and other peripherals) and the 3rd quarter event for obviously everything else (iPhone, iPad, Watch, Airpods, TV, HomePod, etc.). I know there's probably a reason why they don't do that but I also find it odd whenever they release a product in a press release and not in one of there events. Or whenever certain products, like iPads, can either be released in either the first half or second half of the year instead of sticking to a specific release window.

Obviously this is just a quick rant and personal opinion but I'd like to know what everyone else thinks and if anyone knows why Apple doesn't do this.",1674650259.0

"People in the Apple ecosystem who got rid of their Apple Watch, why?",262,10kw4ke,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10kw4ke/people_in_the_apple_ecosystem_who_got_rid_of/,452,"e.g. you have an iphone, ipad  and MacBook but just don't get along with the watch

 \- you switched to another type of smart watch, if so how is it better for your circumstances?

 \- you realised you didn't need one or found it too annoying, what specifically: charging hassle, it broke too easily, didn't do what you'd hoped, another 'thing' to have to manage etc

&#x200B;

I am considering getting one, but unlike a phone/laptop/computer that I've used for decades, this is an entirely new type of device, so I am interested to know why people felt it fell short enough to ditch it entirely.

For people who still have an Apple Watch and love it, great! But this is not the thread for you to comment on :D


**EDIT**: thanks everyone for all your very detailed reponses and discussions, super informative I will read them all and then decide!

**EDIT 2**: the single biggest issue for most people seems to be the battery life, so for that reason, for now, I'm out. Once they get the battery-life up to a week, then I will reconsider. Regarding the 'distractions' it's really hard to gauge as I know you can configure it and for every person who says 'it's a nightmare' another says 'game changer' as they don't have to use their phone as often. Other reasons include longevity, as other people say, for the same money you can get a watch, though functionally poorer, will last decades.",1674644587.0

A lesson learned. Avoid buying any secondhand Airpods.,1,10jzjxq,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10jzjxq/a_lesson_learned_avoid_buying_any_secondhand/,86,"To start, I will say I'm very tech savvy. Today I went to buy some Airpods pro gen 2 that i found listed on offer up BNIB. I stressed to the seller that I wanted to verify the authenticity before I handed over the money. Trust me when I say, these are the best fakes I have ever seen. I checked the serial number on the apple coverage website and it was all green. I connected them to my phone and all the settings that should pop up were there. Every single serial number matched; the box, the case, the individual airpods, and even in the settings app. They even had applecare+ until 2025. These things had me fooled for a solid 4 hours, until I turned on transparency mode. I could tell something was off. I went to the apple store and 3 techs were stumped with the authenticity since it even registered on their diagnostics tools and showed a valid SN. The main tell was the font was ever so slightly off on the inside of the lid and the weight of the counterfeit pods were slightly lighter than authentic. Moral of the story, do not buy airpods on third party marketplaces unless the seller is willing you meet you at apple and let a tech or two take a look at them.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Fake Airpods are getting almost indistinguishable from the real thing. If buying secondhand or from a third party marketplace, do not trust anyone not willing to meet you at an apple store.

A work around is to download the iCloud desktop app and let it completely fill your local storage with your library.

This now means the videos download will be in 4k UHD and 60fps. However will lack HDR data from the file.

[Rant] Customer Service hung up on me when faced with a difficult issue - twice,0,10iskkm,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10iskkm/rant_customer_service_hung_up_on_me_when_faced/,23,"I’m curious if anyone has come across a similar situation recently, and if anyone has advice to not run into this issue moving forward. 

A couple days ago my phone (iPhone 12 mini) stopped being able to connect with Wi-Fi. Add to that cell towers in my area going down, my phone had no way to connect with the outside world. Using my partners phone, I called Apple Care to try and diagnose the issue. The rep’s first suggestion was to reset and reinstall the iOS. I asked multiple times if this would wipe my phone. I would have to back it up properly first if so, as I can’t lose valuable information on there. 

She emphatically said multiple times it would not. Lo and behold, it did. As soon as I mentioned this, and was quite unhappy as we had directly discussed this, she stopped speaking. The line was open, I could hear ambient noise for about 3 minutes, then she hung up. I later found out she made no notes on the case either. 

Just today, I had to call again about an issue with some Apple software on my computer. It’s my primary work software, and the issue I was dealing with is very complex. After spending about 30 minutes on the phone with support, realizing we were going in circles and he wasn’t going to be able to help, I asked to speak with a supervisor or someone who might have more knowledge on such a niche (but very important) issue. 

Similar to the first call, he went silent for a couple minutes, then hung up. I again found out in a subsequent call he didn’t take any notes about the call. 

Has this happened with anyone else? Very unhappy with this lack of professionalism and accountability.",1674417432.0
Netflix is missing quite a few features on Apple TV,72,10j31ga,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10j31ga/netflix_is_missing_quite_a_few_features_on_apple/,54,"Title, I'm sure I can't be the only one who's noticed this.

Not only are we stuck with the old landscape tile design, but we're missing:

\- No way to remove from Continue Watching

\- A way to remote control? This is possible across every other TV device I use and isn't limited to Google Cast, as Xbox & Playstation both show in the ""Casting"" menu (Likely using Netflix Remote Control)

&#x200B;

I understand these may be minor features, but the fact that even the UI looks super dated compared to the other platforms just raises so many questions for me. You're paying the same price as everyone else, and being punished for choosing to use the service on the Apple TV.

"I wanted to use OpenAI's Whisper speech-to-text on my Mac without installing stuff in the Terminal so I made MacWhisper, a free Mac app to transcribe audio and video files for easy transcription and subtitle generation. Would love to hear some feedback on it!",298,10j4rzb,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10j4rzb/i_wanted_to_use_openais_whisper_speechtotext_on/,85,"When OpenAI released Whisper last year ([https://openai.com/blog/whisper/](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/)) I was blown away by how good it was at speech to text. Rap songs, low quality recordings, multi language conversations, everything seemed to work really well! Unfortunately the setup process required you to install a bunch of dependencies to then have to use Terminal for transcribing audio. Last week I made a very easy to use Mac app to solve this, MacWhisper!

Quickly and easily transcribe audio files into text with OpenAI's state-of-the-art transcription technology Whisper. Whether you're recording a meeting, lecture, or other important audio, MacWhisper quickly and accurately transcribes your audio files into text.

**Features**

* Easily record and transcribe audio files
* Just drag and drop audio files to get a transcription
* Get accurate text transcriptions in seconds (\~15x realtime)
* Search the entire transcript and highlight words
* Supports multiple languages (fastest model is English only)
* Copy the entire transcript or individual sections
* Supports Tiny (English only), Base and Large models
* Reader Mode
* Edit and delete segments from the transcript
* Select transcription language (or use auto detect)
* Supported formats: mp3, wav, m4a and mp4 videos.
* .srt & .vtt export

**Which version do you need?**

You can download MacWhisper or MacWhisper Pro. MacWhisper Pro includes the Large model which offers the best transcription available right now and has industry leading accuracy but takes a lot longer to generate. The regular version of MacWhisper uses the Tiny (English only) and Base models, which are still very accurate and fast. Depending on your usecase you might want to use the Pro version. You can always change what version you want later.

Gumroad has a 250MB file size limit for apps that are listed for free so I had to make that part paid. Select **MacWhisper Pro** from the sidebar and pay 6 or more to get it.

But Apple generally has such great service I never dreamed they would screw me over like this.

I purchased online to replace my wife's phone, because NO DEALER in my area had what I wanted in stock. Got the new phone fine.  And the trade-in process initially seemed excellent - estimated $160 for a 4 generations old phone, sent me a prepaid return box, all good.

Then I get the ""revised value"" and it's $55 not $160.  No way I'm taking that, but they will send the phone back to me no charge.

Here's where it gets ""dark"" though.  I *accidentally* clicked the ""Accept"" button instead of ""Reject"".  There is no ""are you sure?"" confirmation.  Just ""Thank you, you've accepted the offer"".   No recourse, nothing.

I *immediately* went to Support.  Online customer service can't help, but they take all my information and suggest I try the phone support line.  The phone support person is very nice, but even they CANNOT REVERSE THE PROCESS.

Having to tell Siri to go away every time it’s used is simply unintuitive. The phrases it uses are immature at best. For example it will say “Uhh hu?” if you don’t speak fast enough. What in the California!?

Siri is has become the substandard of Virtual Assistants. Even pop culture continually rags on it.

Siri on Apple TV vs iOS,2,10i6zz8,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10i6zz8/siri_on_apple_tv_vs_ios/,2,"I’ve been seeing so many “is Siri getting dumber” posts. I agree that this is a concern, a big time one as many use digital assistants for the day to day. I am wondering if, at least partially, it’s because Apple tries to keep a large amount of its operations on the phone itself as opposed to using the cloud exclusively, as well as not getting as much analytical data from users to improve the system. 

I know Apple was caught a while back listening and keeping peoples audio without their consent, and I’m wondering if they were trying to get more data to improve Siri, much like maybe Alexa and Google do/did?

Has anyone else realized that Siri on Apple TV is faster and much better than on the iPhone, at least for me? It’s actually a pleasure to use the Siri Remote compared to Siri on the iPhone. I wonder if the Apple TV actually uses customer data to improve Siri (at least for Apple TV). I can’t speak to the HomePod because I have not yet used one.

Anyone agree with this at some level? Or do you have any other things to add to this topic?",1674349504.0

"Dropbox forcing ""Files On-Demand"" cloud storage instead of local storage",106,10hujl3,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10hujl3/dropbox_forcing_files_ondemand_cloud_storage/,54,"I use Dropbox to sync my files between a few devices. Notably, I want all of the files to remain on all of the devices.

This weekend, I was presented with a message from my Dropbox client that it wants to move all of my locally stored files from ~/Dropbox to ~/Library/CloudStorage. This is a huge pain in the ass, as it will require updating about a hundred configuration files to point to the new path.

Much more disturbing, the new Dropbox client indicates that all files will be marked as ""On-Demand,"" *i.e.*, potentially not living on my devices but only in Dropbox. This is alarming, since many of my workflows expect files to be available locally and to be immediately available, rather than waiting to be downloaded from Dropbox. It also raises the ugly prospect of discovering that needed files are inaccessible when I'm offline, and being unable to access them (or, at least, without a lengthy delay).

Some research revealed [this article from Microsoft last year](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-disk-space-with-onedrive-files-on-demand-for-mac-529f6d53-e572-4922-a585-e7a318c135f0#:~:text=OneDrive%20Files%20On%2DDemand%20helps,new%20information%20about%20each%20file.) regarding similar changes in OneDrive, and, further, that these changes appear to have been prompted by Apple deprecating some kexts that OneDrive had used for syncing cloud storage files. I also found [this MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/01/onedrive-mac-users-unhappy-files-on-demand/) suggesting that OneDrive users hate this change and find it to be buggy.

I'm extremely irritated by this change, as **I never have and never will rely on on-demand cloud storage for these files**. These files are core to my daily digital life and I expect them to be available all the time on every device and kept fully in sync. I have plenty of local storage space for these files and I am accustomed to managing all of it. So these changes, which not only break current workflows but might introduce new and persistent headaches, are motivated by features that aren't even relevant to me.

I am so deeply irritated by this bullshit that I am now looking at other cloud storage providers that won't engage in this kind of behavior. If I have to blow an entire weekend reconfiguring my machines due to the ghoulish demands of Dropbox, I may as well switch to a provider that is actually sensitive to users' needs.

Recommendations are welcome.",1674317114.0
Why doesn't Apple specify NAND flash SSD configuration/speed,0,10hlije,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10hlije/why_doesnt_apple_specify_nand_flash_ssd/,28,"Why doesn't Apple clarify the speed of the SSDs that come in their computers? I feel it is a bit shady that we don't really know what we're buying.

The M2 MacBook Pro has now famously shipped with a single NAND flash for the 256GB model meaning it is half the speed of the 256GB SSD in the original M1 MacBook Air unless you buy a 512GB model.

I have heard that now with the M2 Mac Mini, you won't get a dual NAND configuration until the 2TB model.

If Apple won't give all devices a dual NAND config (2x128GB, 2x256GB, 2x512GB) I feel like they should at least specify the rated SSD speed of the device.

Can we get multi-monitor support? Like great UX instead of random support?,102,10hhm48,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10hhm48/can_we_get_multimonitor_support_like_great_ux/,46,"So I love display tech and I’m a software engineer. So every year I’m swapping out for a hopefully improved experience. 

I run two MacBook pros and they share a dual monitor setup. So I’m intimately experiencing MacOS display support.

I’m seeing an abysmal experience with this setup. 

Whenever I switch inputs the MacBook never remembers the monitor arrangement and it must be manually set.

When inputs are switched from monitors the other MacBook is still “using” the monitors. Meaning that open applications are invisible. The mouse can scroll over to the right or left into invisible monitors which are no longer displaying this computer’s displays yet they still are shown to the OS. 

Can we get these issues fixed and create a premium experience for monitors?",1674272024.0
I was today years old when I learned how warranty exchanges work with Apple,0,10hhjzn,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10hhjzn/i_was_today_years_old_when_i_learned_how_warranty/,84,"Edit: I was at the \~2 hours away Apple store to pick up an order, and in the area to visit family. I brought the defective MagSafe Duo with me to exchange, having checked to confirm the store had stock. I did not mean to give the impression that I drove there *only* to exchange the MagSafe Duo. I did not do my homework. No excuses for that. In my weak defence, I've never had to do homework on Apple's processes before because they are typically so slick and seamless. I was just surprised I could not simply exchange the defective item for in-store stock, something that I would take for granted at Best Buy, Home Depot, or in a purely online environment, Amazon.

Edit 2: Sounds like there may have been a break down in the process at the Apple store. Other people have reported different experiences in similar circumstances. E.g., they should have agreed to mail the device to me.

Mini-rant. Drove the \~2 hours to my nearest Apple store to exchange my MagSafe Duo charger, the phone-side charger of which stopped working a couple weeks ago. The unit was still under warranty. Despite a dozen or so MagSafe chargers SITTING RIGHT THERE ON THE SHELF they could not give me one.

>""Those ones are for sale.""

Had to wait for a Genius bar appointment. To submit my request. To have Apple ship a replacement unit. Back to the same store. The one that is \~2 hours away. They'll let me know when it arrives.

Hands down one of the most Monty Python / Seinfeld / Curb Your Enthusiam skit worthy experiences I have ever had. Hours later I am still thoroughly flabergasted.

What worked was updating the other devices, and then restarting the Mac Mini once it was on the latest Venture update and then it wasn't a problem!

Apple ID Issues,18,10g74bh,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10g74bh/apple_id_issues/,27,"Hi all, very long post, TL;DR at bottom. 

On November 24th of 2022 I was sitting down with my family to watch the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving Special on AppleTV. I logged into Apple TV in browser on my windows machine (which is hooked up to the “TV”). It said I’d receive a prompt to authenticate with my iPhone. 

On my iPhone I received a prompt that someone in <a major city within a (long) days drive of me> was trying to access my account. Now, I know these things don’t always tell you the city you actually live in, especially when it’s actually pretty rural, so I assumed this was myself and hit Accept. It then gave me a 6 digit pin to put in on Apple TV website, which I did, and we watched the show. 

Later that evening I found out while checking my email that my Apple ID password had been reset. I realized I may have accidentally authenticated someone that wasn’t supposed to have access to the account, so I quickly attempted to reset my password thru the Settings app on my iPhone. I was told my Apple ID was locked for security reasons, and to visit iForgot.Apple.com to reset the password. 

On this website it asked for my Apple ID email and associated phone number, which I provided. Fortunately, it seems the phone number hadn’t yet been changed because it seemed to work. I was told I’d receive a text in 24 hours to reset my password.  I was like “ok that’s not ideal, but I can work with that. I’d rather not loose my account.”

Now, for background reference, I am a student right now. I do have a part time job that pays ok, but the economy has been real shitty lately, so I have taken up DoorDash and Uber to try to keep putting money into savings for my future. 

Aside from the aforementioned windows machine, my only other devices are an old MacBook Pro, and an iPad Mini (I believe 2nd generation but I don’t know for sure, it was a gift). I require both of these devices to do my schoolwork. 

Anyways, back to iForgot, after the 24 hour waiting period, I didn’t receive any text or email or anything, but I went back to the website and they told me I’d need to wait something like 2 weeks (13 days or so) to reset my password. At this point I was miffed. My income and my grades were dependent on having my devices functioning, but given the point in the semester I sucked it up and said “ok, fine. Small price to pay for not loosing my accounts right? I’ll just not by any more Christmas presents, and work out some plea deals with my professors.” 

A couple days into this two week period, I log into IForgot to check the status, and it says I can reset my password on my Mac. I’m thinking this is great, way faster than the 2 weeks I was expecting. I open up my MacBook and wait for the notification to pop up. It never does. I try running the iForgot steps again (account email, phone number, etc) and still nothing on my Mac. The iForgot website says I should be receiving a notification, but it never arrives. 

I tried again to tell it I needed to reset my password and it threw me into another 24 hour waiting period. I waited thru this period, where I was told I’d receive a message after 24 hours to reset my password. No such message arrived, and logging into iForgot again, it told me I needed to wait another two weeks.  I should also add that on this screen it says that “Apple Support cannot shorten the wait time.” So now I’m pretty frustrated, but I don’t see what else I can do but wait. 

Guess what? A couple days later iForgot has the same message about resetting my password on my Mac, and repeats the above, I log in, receive no notifications, and the iForgot countdown timer is gone again. 

So I call up Apple Support at this point because clearly something is going wrong. The first tech I speak with tells me that I need to shut down and leave powered down any devices except the one I want to reset the password with. Now I will note, NOWHERE on the iForgot website does it tell you this, but according to the tech support guy, if the system sees my other devices logged in, it’ll kick me out of the reset process. 

He has me try a couple other methods of reset on each of my devices, none of them working or course. At the end he tells me I’m just gonna have to wait for the password reset program on iForgot to run its course. He closes my ticket and, a couple days later (after finals and stuff) I attempt, again, to reset my password. 

This time I turned off all my Apple Devices, save my phone, which the Apple Support Tech *assured* me was allowed to stay on. 

At this point I think you can guess how this went. 24 hour waiting period with the promise of a text or email. No such text or email. 2 week waiting period, which after a couple days, tells me to use my Mac to reset the password, I try, but never receive any notification on my Mac. 

At this point I’m into Christmas break, and have had no access to my account for nearly a month. I called Apple Support again, and was asked to try basically all of the above again. Then they passed me up the chain to a “Senior Support Tech” or something like that. This woman, I forget her name, was very kind and understanding, but not at all helpful. She asked me to walk her through everything we tried, and had me try a couple other things (like resetting thru a friends iPhone using the Apple Support App) all to no avail. After several hours on the phone, she tells me it could be an issue with the iForgot security system, but to figure out what it could be we’d need to run another attempt at password reset with the iForgot system. She tells me that I may not receive anything at 24 hours, even tho I should, but to check it every day, and to use an emailed hyperlink to get in touch with her as soon as I notice the iForgot system has kicked me out of the reset process. 

So we start the process again, and low and behold, 24 hours, no notifications, two weeks hold, and a couple days in it tells me to use my Mac to reset (the Mac that has been powered off for nearly two weeks at this point, along with my iPad).  As soon as this happens, I open up my email to get in touch with the senior support lady, and lo and behold, the hyperlink she gave me to get in contact requires me to log in with my Apple ID to function. The Apple ID that is currently locked for security reasons. 

So seeing no other option, I called back apple support *again* and was put thru all the above paces again, was handed off to a new senior support guy named something like Dave or David or something, and he tells me all the same things, has me try all the same things as Nice Support Staff Lady, although he’s very grouchy the entire time. 

I think you can guess at this point. 24 Hours. Two Weeks. A couple days later I’m booted from the reset. Dave only provided the email link that requires Apple ID to get in touch. I call Apple Support again, walk the first guy through it again, and am passed up the chain again, this time to a guy named Ralph or something like that. 

I should also interject here, that during this entire time I have not been able to do most of the work I normally do to bring in my income, because DoorDash and Uber have had app updates that are required, but I cannot update, because my Apple ID is locked. So not only am I out my account, and all of its purchases, I’m also out one of my primary income streams now too, and at this point it’s after Christmas. I have been locked out for over a month and unable to do anything about it. 

Ralph tells me that it’s possible there is some other problem going on that is unforeseen. He asks me to try the iForgot process again, and to let him know when it kicks me out again. And THANK GOD when I bring up that the hyperlink apple support thing won’t work because my Apple ID is locked, he says, “Oh good point, I’ll give you an email you can respond to via email, as well as my office hours.” 

Over New Year’s Eve weekend, we try again, 24 hours, two weeks, kicked out, I send him an email, wait a couple days and get a call. He tells me that it’s possible there’s some other devices out there that are logged in with my Apple ID that are booting me from the process. I think about it for a while and am fairly certain that I’ve done my due diligence and that none of my friends or family had my Apple ID logged in. 

He says it can even be things I wouldn’t think about like a watch or Apple TV. I hadn’t thought of the Apple TV before, but my parents (who live two times zones away) have an Apple TV. Ralph says he’s going to escalate my case to the Apple Engineers to hopefully get this sorted out. 

I call my mom, she double checks the Apple TV, and I am not logged in on it. Haven’t been for “months or years” according to her. My dad verifies as well a few days later. I let Ralph know this by email, he says thanks and that he’s still waiting to hear from the engineers. A couple days go by and what I get back from Ralph and the engineers is basically, “Oh yeah it looks like one of your devices was still active and is getting you kicked out, but for security reasons we can’t tell you which one. Better double check them all and try again.” 

At this point by the tone of, and increasing time between, Ralph’s emails I can tell he is getting exasperated by me and or my case. I am also pretty much hopeless at this point. I have had my iPad and MacBook powered off all year, all my friends and family have confirmed not a single device is logged in with my Apple ID, which should leave just my 3: iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro. The last two of which *have been off all year*. 

Ralph has me try the iForgot system again (resetting thru the Settings app on my phone), and as I am sure you know to expect at this point: 24 hours. Two weeks. Use your Mac. No notifications. Booted out of the system again. 

At some point in the last 2 ish weeks I asked Ralph what would happen if someone had compromised the account and actually gotten a device logged in and set up with my ID. He said, in a nutshell, “well that would suck, you’d have to wait for them to stop using your Apple ID. Cuz any time you try the reset process, If anyone is using or even has powered on a device with your Apple ID logged in on it, it’s going to kick you out of the reset process. Which is unfortunate, but there is nothing I can do about that.” 

The last I heard from Ralph at this point is the message about my devices “not all being logged off and I should please double check” (they have all been off since before new years). That email was a week ago and I’m beginning to wonder if there’s nothing that can be done for my account. 

I am nearing the 2 month mark since this whole ordeal began, and I’m pretty hopeless. I have had to take extra shifts at work to make up some of the lost income from not being able to Dash and Uber, and I haven’t had access to any of my music or movies that I had spent years accumulating. Apple Support has been completely unhelpful. I don’t know what to do at this point. 

Is there anyone who’s experienced similar issues? Is there any way for me to ever get my account back? I’d take any and all suggestions at this point. 

Thanks for your time. 

TL;DR, Apple ID was probably compromised back in November and the password reset has been failing for 2 months straight. Apple Support has been completely useless and not helped anything.",1674148230.0

Are there any actual uses for Neural Engine on the desktop,8,10fiyx5,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10fiyx5/are_there_any_actual_uses_for_neural_engine_on/,2,"Apple first designed their own silicon for their phones. Now they are putting these chips in all their devices.

They promote their “Neural Engine” in every product launch but… is that part of the CPU ACTUALLY USED for anything on the desktop?

There was a thread on this topic a year ago. It was basically a list of things it COULD BE used for, mentions of Photoshop/FinalCut and references to faceID on phones.

As a desktop user, this feature seems like potential more than product. A larger GPU seems more useful for me personally but Im curious if I am missing something that has actually been implemented.

If there are no uses, I wish they would stop talking about it. If they are going to promote it so much, they ought to better explain what it actually does.

Ive seen some comments on using these cores for ML projects but Ive heard that the ML libraries for MacOS are way behind other platforms which use GPU’s or dedicated AI hardware. This is probably a different discussion. Normal consumers are not running ML models on their iMac.",1674077687.0

Who misses the Apple Watch Edition (Titanium version that was replaced by the current AW ultra)?,2,10doqc5,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/10doqc5/who_misses_the_apple_watch_edition_titanium/,4,"I have a Apple Watch Series 6 edition for over 2 years and its the best $1k i have ever spent with it being the only apple device i have not filed a apple care + claim on. It’s the titanium version in which i really enjoyed. I beat the living crap out of this thing and its still going strong, while appearing indistinguishable from the basic Apple Watch. It also actually looks good on my wrist. Recently i learned that the Apple Watch Edition was discontinued in favor of the Apple Watch ultra. I was actually pretty pissed considering that I don’t need everything that the ultra has to offer, but yet if i want to upgrade in the future I actually will have to chose between the ultra or the stainless steel. Better yet it appears too big for my wrist.

For those who owned/owns an Apple Watch Edition. What would be your plan should time come that you would be due for a upgrade? 

Go back to traditional watches? Get the ultra? Downgrade to Stainless Steel version? Or go watch less?

I have to say, I was pretty satisfied  considering some of the short coming of a fold. But I instantly fell in love with s23 Ultra, from both a specs standpoint, but also design standpoint. So I finally caved and bought one via trade-in with Samsung. The last few hrs have been standard setup. But there are a few things I've noticed so far since I've been kind of testing the 2 devices. App optimization is so much better on the s23 Ultra, and surprisingly, sound quality via speakers is better, but not by much. Both have good speakers. Content is obviously better on the Z Fold. Gaming has been the toughest aspect to judge so far.... the more immersive experience on the Z fold is nice, but the richer screen quality and better battery drain on the s23 have also been nice. Yes, technically, you will get better performance on the s23. But both SOC will be plenty for gaming. Im honestly kind of torn on which one I want. The minimal camera testing I have done has been pretty underwhelming for th s23, as standard photos between the two look pretty similar, although the portraits came out better on the s23. Still more testing to go. Is anyone testing both and found a clear winner? I plan on testing night mode and Dex tonight and will carry the s23 ultra for the day today to see how it does during my daily schedule.",1677977396.0

My Samsung customer service and warranty experience,18,11ifdly,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11ifdly/my_samsung_customer_service_and_warranty/,10,"My first experience with Samsung warranty is with my Galaxy S8. I updated the firmware and it can no longer access wi-fi. Sent it into Samsung to fix, after about 3 weeks I called them and ask them for a follow up, and they told me they just got my phone and will working on it now. Which was a lie, because I had tracking and it showed Samsung received it in 2 days . They shipped it back to me the next day.  Most likely they forgot about until I called and follow up. I was phone-less for almost 3 weeks.

My second experience was with my QN90B TV.  One day my TV suddenly had a white line across the screen. I called Samsung to use my warranty. I sent them several pictures and i circled where the line was on the screen. The woman denied my claim and saying she and her manager can't see the white line. Naturally, I got very angry and cuss at them for being blind and after 10 mins, I just hanged up.  I tried again the next day, and got a different person and he approve my claim and said he could clearly see the white line, and they sent a TV repair man over to my house to replace the screen.  The TV repair man said the white line was noticeable and it needed to be replace.  Not sure why I got denied the first time. >\_>

This third experience just happened. I pre-ordered the Black Galaxy S23 on Feb 14 to go pick up at Samsung Galaxy Experience store at Yorkdale Mall in Canada.  I received an e-mail saying there were Canada wide shortage, and it will be delayed 2 weeks.  Its been 2 weeks, I called into Samsung and they can't help me, because Samsung Galaxy store is a separate entity from Samsung online, even though I ordered online.  Tried calling Samsung store at Yorkdale, several times today and nobody picks up, but the machine keeps tell me to call 1800SAMSUNG (But they don't know).  I can literally walk into any carrier store or Best Buy right now and see that they have stock.  I know people that place their order days after me and days after release, that already got their phone. So...... yeah....... I'm kind of questioning if there is a shortage?  So, right now they don't know what happen to my order, and nobody from Samsung can help me. My options is to keep waiting, or cancel and reorder and I lose my 100$ preorder coupon and the double storage promotion.  (They wouldn't even make an exception for my case)

I absolutely love this phone. I've had LG phones consistently over the last 10 years ago. I've had Samsung phones in the past but it's been a while. The battery life on the v40 has degraded to a point that I can't continue using it and it's starting to lag and bog down.

I bought the v40 within the first few months of it coming out, and intend to hold my position that buying flagship phones are the best way to future proof to keep it for years. I'm looking at Samsung now because LG is dead and gone in the phone market. Can't stand Apple crap and have zero interest in that.

How does the Ultra 23 match up with the v40 in terms of size? I'm reading mixed feelings on the curved screen of the Ultra 23. I have a tiny scratch on the v40 but after all these years it still basically looks brand new. I'm a paramedic so my phone is out in the field a lot, and I need something with good screen protection. I've never used anything on the v40 but feel like I'll have to with the S23?

My last post was on background usage and I was able to get 3 hours SOT, obviously it was meant to compare previous phones I've used but it's pretty good!

This post will be a day of use from 10AM- 4PM at the Zoo using 5G, with Photo taking, Videos, Navigation and light social media. I was on light performance mode the whole time. I got home with still 33% left and 2hr 30 hrs SOT. 

https://imgur.com/a/qfRgkNW

Using WiFi and social media I got it to 3hours 40 minutes until battery saver mode was triggered. (Will probably stretch to 4 hours 20 minutes ;) to 0%) 

https://imgur.com/a/vaZjjZs

I think if you weren't such a heavy user you'd be able to stretch to 4-5 hours screen on time being out and using the phone. Basically lasting 9am to 6pm easily. 

Here are some photos, https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/rKykarG1NFKf 

only 1-2 turned out blurry due to motion of animals and lighting! Definitely not as bad as I thought it would be, but the time it takes to take a photo definitely feels longer coming from an iPhone especially in less optimal lighting, and photos don't turn out as clear in these conditions. 

My average usage so far with my S23 has seen it last an average of 5hours SOT. I have also not really noticed much of a difference with light performance mode, both in terms of OneUI performance and also battery life, (Can comfortably emulate games at 30/60fps on light performance)

- 2-3 hours when doing heavy Switch Emulation, Utorrent background usage, Spotify background usage, Bluetooth devices

- 3-5 hours when out using Nav, camera, social media, 5G

- 7-8 hours all day YouTube Tiktok at home with WiFi

Very much comparable to the iPhone 14 Pro was. But I wish I was able to take photos or videos more and last a bit longer, S23+ would've been perfect battery life for this.",1677917122.0

I'll sum it up, I had an s21 Ultra, and loved it but hated the size. Best buy had a killer deal and I got an s22 ultra for $15 paid for outright(essentially a free new phone). But I wanted an S22+ because of the form factor. Fast forward to now, and I wanted to buy an S23+.

I went to my local best buy and bought an S23+ by trading in a cracked galaxy s7 I got from eBay for $40. I also received a $100 Best Buy gift card. I did the bill credit thing but I don't mind. Today I sold my s22 ultra for $600 cash and am very happy! In the end, after I subtract the taxes, the new phone case, the s7 phone, and the $199 balance over the next 3 years, I'm up $220 cash and a $100 gift card plus a free galaxy s23+! (I also turned the cracked s7 into a Verizon store for the $800 bill credits)

Onto the phone! I LOVE the battery life! I thought it was overhyped but it's real! 

My S22 Ultra SOT was 4-6.5 hours MAX with 1080p mode(not 1440p) It was always dying with minimal use.

My S23 Plus SOT is 7-9 hours! Same usage! It's insane how a 300mah small battery can outperform an Ultra series phone. I can only imagine the S23 ultra sot! 

Overall it's an upgrade for me! I like the smaller size, I have 256gb now vs the 128gb, love the battery life and I LOVE the flat screen! I am so happy with the device! Samsung did a great job! This is honestly how the S10+ was to me when I first got it!

**Performance**

This thing is butter smooth. CPU is very fast, I didn't have any lags whatsoever. No stutter, micro lags or anything. Using the dev options to check, the refresh rate is between 24 Hz and 120 Hz. It's also 24 Hz on the Always On Display. Doesn't matter that much for me, because I set it up so that I have to tap the phone for it to show a few seconds (so I can't say anything about battery regarding AOD). I'm not a mobile gamer, but tried Asphalt 9 on max settings to see how it performs, and it was running with 120 FPS the whole time (as you would expect from a flagship phone).

**Storage**

Having so much storage is very nice (coming from a 32 GB A series phone) and 256 GB is more than enough for me. System takes 37.45 GB on my phone (default apps not included).

**Battery**

Battery is, while not insane, good. I charged on 3rd of March at around 6am. It took roughly 50 minutes with my ""old"" 15 W Samsung charger to charge to 85 % from 15 %. I plugged it in a few minutes ago (it's 11:50 am, 4th of March) because it was at 10 % with 4 hours of screen on time and a lot of Spotify running in the background. But, considering I only charge to 85 % and it did run 1 day, 5 hours without charge (so a lot of standby), I'd say it's good, and it's definitely enough for me. Watching YouTube for 2 hours 10 minutes took 7 %.

**Camera**

Also, not as insane as the camera from the Ultra (especially regarding zoom), but very good. I used it to film 30 minutes of 4k 60 FPS video on my grandmas birthday and, while it got warm of course, it didn't overheat or something. Also, I did some pretty good shots with portrait mode and the 3x zoom lens, they look fantastic. Filming at night does look ok (depends on the light, of course). Pictures are pretty good at night using night mode. You can't switch between lenses when filming with 4k 60 FPS or 8k 30 FPS, it's possible with everything below. (You can film in 1080p 120 FPS with Pro Video Mode, but you can't switch between lenses there either).

Opinions on the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra for Digital Art / Clip Studio Paint?,17,11hjd6w,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11hjd6w/opinions_on_the_galaxy_tab_s8_ultra_for_digital/,3,"Hi all,

I am a hobby artist. I occasionally sell commission work.

One piece of technology I have wanted since 2010 was a portable digital sketchbook.

I have always used Windows for my computer OS. I use a Samsung Galaxy phone currently. I have enjoyed Android far more than iOS.

The idea of having a tablet that would pair up easily with my current workspace is exciting. I'm excited about the idea of being able to use my preferred art program of Clip Studio Paint with all the brushes and assets I have for it already rather than Procreate. I also like that CSP pairs with your smartphone while using a tablet for easy access to shortcuts. I know CSP requires a separate subscription plan to use on a tablet versus a desktop, but that's not really an issue to me.

I also recall in one review that certain Wacom pens work with the S8 Ultra. I think it's just the Wacom One pen, but I would be interested in hearing about any other options. 

I currently use a Huion Kamvas Pro 16 screen tablet to draw on. It stays tethered to my desktop.

So many artist buddies recommend an iPad Pro and iPencil combo. The only real advantage an iPad and iPencil have is less visible lag/stroke latency. I find it more convenient to stick with Windows OS items.

The S8 Ultra does have visible lag in the S-pen on review videos during screen extension use, as well as within Clip Studio Paint if a high stabilization setting is turned on.

If any artists have a screen tablet similar to a Cintiq or Huion as well as an S8 Ultra, does having a portable tablet help your workflow? How easy is it for you to transition your active files/projects between your desk space and mobile space? Do you notice a lag in the pen strokes in certain programs or settings? 

I am also hoping that incorporating this tablet into my study space will help me with college studies, as I imagine that annotations and notes will be easier with the dual workspace option and marking directly on the document.

What other recommendations or suggestions would you have? Thanks for reading!",1677887850.0

On top of that, this phone was in excellent condition, not a single flaw to be found.

In the midst of a crazy Friday at work, I see an email that they are charging me $115 because my screen is cracked. Immediately out of my mouth was ""not a f*king chance"". Unless this box was put under a 200 pound box in the FedEx truck, there is no way there is a crack. This phone could have been sold ""like new"".

I called Samsung, and to be fair it was a quick and painless process to get my money back but, I shouldn't have had to do so in the first place! I told the rep that I was being charged for damage to my trade in device and as soon as I said there is absolutely no way that there was damage and that I had pictures, he immediately said ""we are sending you an email to dispute your charge back"". I didn't have to fill out anything. The email just said that I wasn't getting charged. I didn't have to send any proof or anything. What's the point of this? To see how many people don't call in? Shady move on Samsung's part. Let's screw over our loyal customer base is all I see in that scenario.

Thanks for listening to my rant but also be smart and cover yourself!",1677898444.0

Pro Tip: eSim can make your phone trackable if lock or stolen,110,11g7s4m,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11g7s4m/pro_tip_esim_can_make_your_phone_trackable_if/,86,"For all those unaware if your telecoms carrier allows you to use eSims I highly recommend that you switch to one if it's not an inconvenience.

Samsung phones require a password to turn the phone off if you're phone is locked. If someone who stole your phone removes your sim card it will be harder to track your cellphone. With an eSim installed as long as you have power and data, your phone will be able to send you its location. Otherwise, you're relying on Samsung Smarthings Find Network which only uses other Samsung phones' Bluetooth networks to help you find your phone.

This also works great for travelling too. I use an eSim app and just pay for data when I travel. It's easy to install and when the plane lands I can turn off airplane mode, toggle the new eSim on and have data right away.

This only works for people who have password/fingerprint/faceid locks on their phone and who don't need to move their sim around to other devices.

I hope this helps make Samsung phones less desirable to steal or keep!

So I'm curious of this scenario.  I primarily carry my work phone as my team will need me 24x7.   Because of this I use the ""Secure Folder"" feature and add WhatsApp (personal phone number), Facebook, etc on it.   I do this because work cannot access the secure folder.  The MDM can delete the secure folder, and unlock the mainphone, but not the ""Secure Folder""     Its also a nice way to keep work/personal separated. 

So my question is.......

if I add my personal phone line to my eSIM,  is there two different text messaging/phone call icons?  Would I be able to keep one inside the ""Secure folder""",1677784444.0

Galaxy A33 + Buds2 for 284€ or wait for Galaxy A34,1,11g9hjj,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11g9hjj/galaxy_a33_buds2_for_284_or_wait_for_galaxy_a34/,2,"Hi, i currently have a Galaxy A20e that i use as a secondary work phone (this is, the intended use is light: check emails, some videocalls, browsing, social media and maybe snap some photos to scan documents). I want to upgrade, as A20e is slow as hell and is soon to lose security support (this is key for me). My main phone is an iPhone, but i usually buy Samsung for me and my family when i need Android alternatives (my parents have A52S and A53 for instance), mainly due to the extended update support.

Checking the Samsung website i saw a deal on the Galaxy A33, where you get the phone (in blue, 6+128) with free Galaxy Buds2 (in black) for a total of 284€ (normally the pack is 299 but there is a 5% off coupon). You could take it a bit lower in educational discounts for 249€ but without Buds2.

I know that the Galaxy A34 is close to be released this month, but will probably cost more than this (at least 369€, and rumors say a possible increate to 420-430€). It should also have a Dimensity processor instead of Exynos. A33 should still have 3 year of OS-upgrades + 4 security patches in store, which is really nice for me. New phones released this year from other manufacturers will have less support than A33.

Would you say buying the A33 with this offer is worth it for the intended use, or should i wait for the A34?

It all started when I wanted to leave Apple so I started looking and only heard good things about Samsung. It was all good util i wanted to change Icons a few years ago and had to resort to Hex_ to do so and even then it wasn't like any other Android its was so hard then I started noticing other stuff that was locked for example E-Fuse that wasn't well disclosed or that you need samsung headphones to clear the phones cache. Then I started to understand that they tricked me to get into a closed ecosystem like apple. Then I started to litsen to Luise Rohsman on YouTube and even if I don't like everything he stands for I agree that a 1500$ device that I HAVE PAYED FOR should me MINE and not locked. Then they stoped having Micro SD card expansion. Then tried to stop right to repair and removed the Charger that came in the box. They have had so many chances to be good but the choose to not do them. Thats the Phycologick definition of **EVIL**!!!!!!! They are one of the Worst Companies hand in hand with Meta, Apple, Google, Nestle, Kellogg's and Amazon. I am feed up with their behavior. Thats why I am leaving Samsung for good!

Thinking of switching to S23 ultra (lifetime IPhone User),8,11fc3uw,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11fc3uw/thinking_of_switching_to_s23_ultra_lifetime/,47,"Hey guys and girls, you probably get so many of these posts but I thought I would post as I'm at a big crossroads for myself.

I'm a lifelong Apple user, IPhone 14 pro max, AirPods Pro/ Max, AirTags, Apple Watch Ultra and the list goes on. But the problem is I'm just bored, it works, it all works seamlessly with little problems but at the same time with no excitement anymore, and as someone who loves tech and new features Apple just isn't doing anything innovative for me.

I tried the S22 ultra when it came out last year along with the watch 4 classic and I did really like them but I was so far into the Apple ecosystem that everything just felt odd and eventually I changed back. Now the S23 range is out and my head won't let me go 5 mins without thinking about switching.

But if I'm truly honest with you l'm slightly afraid to do so. My entire family is Apple and iMessage is just so easy, I use FaceTime for weekly calls and AirPods Max are the only headphones l've found that both look good on me and actually sound good with best in class NC and Transparency mode. Also the Apple Watch ultra is something I couldn't live without, I hated Apple Watch before the ultra came out due to battery, but the battery life and water resistance as well as (in my opinion) best interface on a smart watch is just great for me.

Even with all this though I still want to switch, from people with experience of just the S22/23 ultra or of both Apple and Samsung, could you give me some suggestions on how to make the transition easier or benefits of doing so. I know I could still use my AirPods Max but does anyone have any problems using them with android? Same with the watch 5 pro. How does it compare to the ultra? I've watched countless videos on the matter but I always find that YouTubers perspectives are a little biased and usually not as extensive as a full time user of the products.

Again I know people probably see this a fair amount on the subreddit and feel free to tell me if this post isn't allowed but some actual user reviews and tips would be really helpful.",1677696607.0

Finally got my Book 3 Ultra! Some performance notes.,3,11exmt3,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11exmt3/finally_got_my_book_3_ultra_some_performance_notes/,10,"I put together my thoughts so far here since I did not see much about the performance and battery life online yet. The laptop has been pretty decent to use, I was looking for a laptop that can handle a decent bit of gaming but also has a good battery life and is portable, this seems to work so far.

## Build Quality / Overall thoughts

Personally, I feel the build quality is good. I noticed a bit of screen wobble and the screen is super reflective. Having a numpad felt a bit weird in terms of positioning my hands. This is the first time I have thought that a trackpad can be ""too big"", I felt the keyboard was so far away sometimes, lol. The keys are also a bit shallow. But I did find myself getting used to these quirks over time.

## Performance

I was a bit disappointed to hear the fans running loud when playing a game or when running benchmarks but the game performance was not even close to what I was expecting from a 4070 (even though it runs at such a low wattage). That was until I switched on the High Performance mode in ""Samsung Settings"" app (it was already in high performance mode in windows battery settings), the performance was so much better after that! I only tested Dota 2 so far, I went from \~55-60 FPS to 100+ FPS with max settings in native resolution. Time Spy scores: [https://imgur.com/a/iY7Z7xB](https://imgur.com/a/iY7Z7xB)

## Battery Life

I have been playing with the laptop just for a few hours now, so I do not have any solid numbers. I saw \~35% decrease in battery when using it for 2 hours at half screen brightness, on the Quiet performance preset in Samsung Settings, adaptive refresh rate enabled, a second screen connected via SuperDisplay, have 15-20 chrome tabs open and playing videos constantly. I would estimate the battery life to be around 5.5 to 8 hours for medium to light use.

## Pros, Cons and Final Thoughts

* Pros
   * Display. Can't think of a better looking display, OLED looks so beautiful and 120 Hz looks plenty smooth
   * Form Factor. Pretty light for a (3.95lb/1.8kg) for a 16 inch laptop and pretty thin as well
   * Performance. I would list this as a Pro if I am not considering the price, the laptop is plenty capable, but a proper gaming laptop would have a way better performance (probably at the cost of battery life and/or good form factor)
* Cons
   * Price. The 'i9 processor' and 'RTX 4070' seems to be contributing more to the price than the performance imo.
   * Keyboard. The lack of a good key travel, the number pad making the overall layout awkward, the weirdly positioned arrow keys do leave quite a bit of room for improvement in this area.
   * Speakers. Really? Bottom facing speakers in 2023 on a $3k laptop? Having such a nice display makes this even more painful for me personally. But overall not too bad.

The screen just might be what makes me keeps this laptop. Let me know if you like to know something about the laptop or if there are things you want me to run on this laptop.",1677656169.0

Samsung Galaxy S23+ Touch Sensitivity.,0,11f16pr,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11f16pr/samsung_galaxy_s23_touch_sensitivity/,40,"Hey all.

I just got my Samsung Galaxy S23+ a couple of days ago coming from a OnePlus 6T. I put a Spigen glass screen protector on it the moment I took it out of the box before turning it on. This is the first Samsung phone I've had since the Galaxy S6.

And something is really killing the experience for me. The touch sensitivity. It feels so unresponsive. I find that swiping left and right feels slow and swiping up and down feels like it's dragging. The OnePlus felt so fluid and smooth but this takes a lot of effort to scroll having to put much more pressure and drag further to make it move. Even then sometimes it barely scrolls and sometimes misses my touch at all. It seems so inconsistent. And I've turned on the setting for increased sensitivity for screen protectors. 

Is anyone else noticing this or just me? It feels awful and honestly I'm thinking of sending it back and getting a new OnePlus. It just ruins the experience.

Also the settings are a mess in comparison. So many things I've had to search the internet to find because of it and some things just seem not as good. The OP has much more customization for a start. And a lot of things in OneUI feels counter intuitive.

Does anyone know if the notification tone and SMS tone can be separate? If so I haven't found it. I prefer the app and SMS tone to have separate sounds? Does anyone know if it can be done? It's stupid if not. No custom accent colours either which is stupid, just basic ones. On OP I could customise it at an RGB colour code level.

Also does anyone know if the auto play for videos can be turned off for the gallery?

Thank you all for reading and thank you in advance for comments and assistance. My main thing here that's driving me mad is the sensitivity and responsiveness.

*Edit:* so to all the folks suggesting it's likely the screen protector, I removed it and tried using the phone without it. No noticeable difference. OneUI just feels clunky compared to what I'm used to and the fingerprint scanner never recognises mine first time despite re-registering it. Unless I press down harder than I'm used to and a good amount of pressure at that. I guess I'm quite unhappy with the Samsung which feels overpriced for the experience.

*Edit2:* so after changing the ""drawing"" settings in ""developer options"" as suggested by *Darkwayn* down below I can confirm over the last couple of days since doing that that the UI feels so much more fluid and responsive as a result. I'm whizzing through gestures, apps and menus barely any different from the smooth experience on the OnePlus I was used to. Huge difference. Why that isn't Samsung's default I'll never know because it feels so much smoother and nicer. I guess folks who have never experienced an interface as smooth as OnePlus' out of the box wouldn't feel it. Shout-out to Darkwayn in the comments, check his comment for instructions if like me the lack of smoothness in the UI was/is killing the experience for you. I still have a few niggles with the settings, some limitations and a few stupid design choices by Samsung but I can bear it for now. The whole video gallery thing seems to be Android wide apparently since A12, however some stocks allow you to turn off autoplay while Samsung does not. If Google/Samsung continue to disappoint maybe I'll consider another option in a few years come replacement time. Hopefully someone finds some of the help in this thread useful if they ever face similar problems or disappointment.",1677669460.0

Is the S23 Ultra seriously that much more scratch prone than past devices (like the S22U)? Never have used a screen protector before.,3,11end2f,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11end2f/is_the_s23_ultra_seriously_that_much_more_scratch/,27,"I've been using smartphones since the original G1 and I've never used a screen protector. No cracks from drops, and no unreasonable scratches other than the micro scratches accumulated from general use. I'm looking at my S9+ that I used for like 4 years with no protector and it looks fine to me still. Little cuts here and there, nothing that I'd actually notice in general use.

Now I'm hearing that the S23U is so incredibly scratch prone that a screen protector is mandatory? Is it *really*? Like I understand micro scratches, they happen over time and it's whatever, but people are making this sound like something new. Like the Scratchpocalypse.

I like cases, always use one, but screen protectors always struck me as a hassle, and I'm having a hard time finding one I can use with the case I've already ordered. Whichever one I check it's either the thing bubbles a lot, doesn't work with cases, or ruins the fingerprint sensor (which I use a lot). I'd be willing to pay a lot for a perfect screen protector, but it doesn't seem to exist, so I'm rapidly leaning into skipping it altogether.

Basically, I'm asking if just using this thing without a protector will eventually result in a nigh unusable screen, or if we're just talking about the sort of thing that would bother a person examining the screen from the right angle with some light and a microscope?

Note that I have converted non-MP3 files to MP3 so that all the files can be easily opened and used.

Hi guys,

I want to buy a Samsung S23 Ultra but only the 8GB RAM variant is in stock where I live. I don't really game on my phone, just scroll a lot of Youtube and maybe some movies on Plex, but have a lot of tabs opened in Chrome (not sure if those take up a lot of RAM, while they're not displayed).

So I don't think i'm an extreme power user.

The 256 GB storage seems more than enough for my needs, I have the same on my current phone and I've never had the need to clean the space even once in 4 years.

My question is this:

Is 8 GB still okay to get as the 256 is exactly what I want, or should I wait for the 12GB RAM variants to be back in stock?

Is RAM much more important in 2023?

I don't mind to have only 2-3 apps in memory before they close, what I don't want, is for the phone not not be as snappy next year, because of the lack of RAM.

The truth (literally!) no one tells you about Android vs iOS updates,178,11dkmpz,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dkmpz/the_truth_literally_no_one_tells_you_about/,89,"I was not sure where to post this observation, but since I love Samsung's version of Android, I would like to leave it there for people who are interested.  


Switcher here. I was an iPhone user for more than 10 years but in 2022 I switched to Samsung for a second time. Partly because of being impressed by an old Samsung phone from 2012. You will probably not believe but it still goes to Internet, uses latest Chrome version (or any browser of your choice) and even installs most apps from Google Play. And it is on KitKat 4.4. I mean, it is the same age as the iPhone 5 that already cannot open any webpage on it's old iOS 10 and install any app (maximum that could have been installed, original was iOS 6 that is the same age as Android 4)  


Generally, one of the major reasons I switched was being tired of constant updates.   
Often I see people on the web and on Reddit particularly writing that ""no Android manufacturer has such software support as Apple"". As an ""Apple veteran"" I have went through 13 major updates on different devices (iPad 1, iPad Air 2, iPhone 4, 5, 6s, 11 Pro). And the way they serve the update didn't change throughout the years: Apple literally downloads it to your device without your consent when you plug the phone on charger and wifi, then out of the blue (often when you are very busy and do not have time for that) they ask ""Install update now or at night"", and you can only postpone it by clicking ""at night"". Then you can delete it from storage but every time a newer version comes out ( for example 15.0.1, 16.1.3 etc) it will download again.  


Most people will just hit ""install"" and it will download. It is a hit-or-miss, but usually every update is a slowdown comparing to the original version. Users often face bugs with every single update. And there is no way back, you cannot revert to the original version if you don't like the one that you had installed.  


Sure thing, updates bring security, better experience, blah blah blah and also bring users to the store in search of a new phone. It is a simple psychological trick everyone knows at Apple, and considering how hard it is to get free of the ""ecosystem"", users usually rush to get a newer iPhone.  


But what if you just do not update on iPhone or iPad? First two years it is going to be OK. After that time sites usually start to lag and not open pages correctly, or the load time increases significantly. This is especially a problem of all banking apps due to them constantly updating all the site code. In the same time, this issue DOES NOT EXIST ON ANDROID. Yes, you get me right: iOS update means everything. If you do not update, you are out. Because all the browsers on iOS are based on Safari's WebKit, so literally if you download Chrome it will change nothing except the skin, sites won't open and there are gonna be even more slowdowns. After 3 years developers usually drop support for older iOS versions and require newer ones. And 3 years literally means 3 major iOS versions, thus people on iOS13 cannot get most new apps and app versions on their devices unless they update or buy a new iPhone if their ones does not support the update.  


In fact, you are in Matrix and are provided with ""two pills"": have a slow but up-to-date iPhone or have a fast but unsupported one.

On the other hand, on Android you can install any modern app (and browser) even as it turns out, on 4.4 KitKat which is the similar age as the iOS 5.1.1 that is installed on my mentioned above iPad 1.   


In fact, getting no update on Android phone does not mean you will have problems with apps and services. It just means that you don't get newer OS features and have a less secure phone. But if you know at least something in tech, does it even make sense? Modern Android is already dummy-proof enough not to allow the install from untrusted sources, as well as you won't probably get anything if you use up-to-date browser (which you do).  


In comparison, how does it feel to have constant updates on Apple? You basically become a beta tester for anything Apple wants to install on your phone. You have to deal with lags, bugs, slowdowns and incompatibility issues. And you cannot ""roll back to original app version"" like on Android or just re-flash the original OS unless you have SHSH blobs (you surely won't have those at the moment you already updated). And in the end you have to buy a new phone because yours does not work as you wish it to. Also you cannot just go and install old app ""apk"" (.ipa in iOS) from web, because ""security"" and copyright, unless you saved the ones tied to your Apple ID on your PC or Mac.  


I have lots of examples of how updates killed my iDevices, but will tell you only the recent one. Since 2014 I was effectively making music on my iPad. I had even bought official Apple lightning to usb adapter to be able to connect my midi keyboard. After I installed the iOS 15 update which I didn't want to do but had to (one of the apps stopped updating) the midi protocol stopped working, synth does not connect and GarageBand and similar apps freeze when it tries to connect and... nothing in the end. Like, WTF. I was making music and suddenly cannot. And you know what is the worst? I cannot go back and this device is now called ""obsolete"", so it does not get any updates or patches except some security ones that do not fix such issues. Now my only choice is to buy a newer iPad and HOPE the problem is fixed already, yet I am sure it is not and the device itself is not worth it.  


So next time you see ANYONE bragging that Android has no updates, show them my post and see their reaction. Because personally I would rather get no system updates than all these untested, poorly optimised and useless yearly updates like it is on Apple devices.  


People who still have Galaxy s3, s4, s5 and older than s10, I know you are here on this sub and I want to hear your voice! Please, tell what is your experience in using the non-updated smartphones? Is it a deal-breaker or something it is possible to live with?",1677526570.0

How I Got A Factory Unlocked S23 Ultra for $306,2,11emhlm,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11emhlm/how_i_got_a_factory_unlocked_s23_ultra_for_306/,5,"First off, I always buy my phones outright, factory unlocked so they don't have specific carrier branding or carrier bloatware.  I then use them with a good reputable MVNO for about half the monthly cost of a service plan from a major carrier with the only downside being slower speed when you're around thousands of other people like in a stadium.

The carriers entice people with shiny new objects with gazillion dollars off deals because (a) they know the majority of consumers can't afford to buy the phone outright and (b) they make the big discount a monthly credit spread over 24-36 months so unless you have 3 or 4 lines with the carrier, you will be paying out the nose for the service which is where they make their profit so they can afford to give you low payments on the phone.  Try to leave before the 24-36 months and you have to give the phone back or pay it off and lose the remaining credits from the discount.

Google Fi and Spectrum have the best deals. Google Fi is more straight forward though. $600 off the phone at purchase and you just have to stay with them 120 days (Google Fi is a T-Mobile MVNO and also uses US Cellular Towers when it makes sense.)  Spectrum is convoluted about getting your money back (there's debate whether it's a service credit that they'll refund the unused portion of if you leave them after 60 days or a Visa Cash card 2 months later or whatever. and you'll get a Spectrum branded phone.

At Samsung Store, the pre-order deal cost with trading in my Note 20 Ultra was $807 including a $46 additional educational discount which pretty much anyone can get. Pass. (Almost forgot, they also threw in for Note 20 trades a free watch that you could net about $125 for on Ebay, so technically net would have been around $680.)

Google Fi, the phone was an instant $600 off or $599 ($649 with tax) 512GB model.  The monthly plan is, with a coupon for a $20 credit, a total of $60 more over the minimum 4 months than the comparable US Mobile plan I use.  So that's a total cost of $709.  The big catch is my Note 20 Ultra is mint condition. Sold it for $483.33 on Ebay.  Net after Ebay fees and shipping cost is $403.  So the net cost on upgrading to the S23 Ultra is $306.  And the best thing is I'm not stuck with a specific carrier branded phone (so it will have better resale value) and don't have to pay for a $40-$70 overpriced plan at Verizon, T-mobile, or AT&T for 2-3 years (I use no more than 10GB a month so a $20 15GB plan for a Verizon MVNO suits me great. Coverage is the same, speeds always adequate(even \*real\* high-speed 5G supported not basically relabeled 4G LTE speed all the time) and great customer service.)",1677624352.0
Galaxy S10+ vs A52s 5G in 2023,3,11edfeh,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11edfeh/galaxy_s10_vs_a52s_5g_in_2023/,7," Hey guys

I own a Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro since 2020. This phone was great in Performance and especially battery life, but unfortunately i've been having really bad ghost touch issues with it since 1.5 years ago with other issues as well. With that said I'm trying to avoid Xiaomi entirely.

I kept looking for a another midrange phone. Galaxy A73 was too expensive where I live (510$), and I heard about Performance issues about the A53 so it didn't really convince me.

I decided in the end to pick the A52s 5G, only to be given a used galaxy S10+ (exynos) as a gift recently. I like the S10+'s screen and Build material and also it's quite fast. But I tested its battery capacity with AccuBattery and it gave me 85% (3500 mAh) so I'm having doubts about its longevity.

I'm currently deciding whether I should stick with the Galaxy s10+ (exynos) ? Or Sell it and buy the A52s 5G ? I don't really care about updates unless they actually correct big issues with the OS, and I mainly use my phone to watch Youtube, take notes and take calls. And I could really use a good battery life like the note 9 Pro's and a bright screen outdoors especially when I'm traveling.

What do you guys think is the best decision ?",1677602870.0

The S22 Ultra only has minor cosmetic damage. The reason for the trade-in is my battery is terrible for some reason; it doesn't last a work day. 

I got the S23 Ultra and sent in my S22 U. About a week later, I receive an email from Samsung that the S22 U was ineligible for full credit because the body or screen was cracked. Knowing the device was in very good condition when I sent it to them, I opted to have them return it instead of accepting $150 or so in credit for the device. 

After I chose to have it returned, I called Samsung's customer service to find out if there would be any options available to me if the phone does come back to me cracked or otherwise damaged and all I had for proof was my story vs theirs. The customer rep was super helpful. Apparently they make video recordings for their ""triage reports"" (or something) so he was able to find video evidence that my phone was not damaged. That was a relief. He offered me a $50 code to be emailed to me for all the trouble; the email never arrived. 

A few days later, I receive my S22 U and it's in the same condition I sent it out. Except! Samsung took my S Pen. I am sorry I did not make any video recordings of the device I was going to trade in. I had grown confident in the Samsung trade-in process as I've been trading in my old devices yearly since the Note8. I will call them again to see if they'll do anything about this.

-S-pen shutter in Expert Raw. I know using a 2sec timer works too, but it's not the same.

-Screen preview i think it's called in real cameras. 
Where if you're busy focusing, the screen will completely zoom in on a tiny part of your live screen preview so you can check the focus.

Usually things are very dark in your preview while astro shooting, so it helps being able to pick a random star and use that to focus on. 
Because of the lens switching i assume it's a fruitless effort to actually zoom in and focus. And then zoom back out. 

Focus peaking is nice but I'd rather preview it myself. Moon shots already prompt this same sort of preview when stabilising at 100x (in the camera app, not expert raw).


-The constellation overlay is cool but every time i've used it, it was off a fair bit. And when i saw some galaxy i could potentially zoom in on (i know) like M44 or something.. that's when i remember finding it while zooming in is going to be hell.

Fraudulent and no responsibility taken. Beyond disappointed and shocked.,9,11dukox,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dukox/fraudulent_and_no_responsibility_taken_beyond/,29,"Hi people,

I've posted this on Samsung Forums but just wanted to share my experience here.

So I've been buying from Samsung since the s4 line years and years ago. However, this is the first time I purchased from the official site. I bought the s23 during pre-order and used the trade-in program, but what happened over 2-3 weeks has completely made me lose faith and trust in Samsung. I will never buy a phone from them again.

I ordered the s23 ultra 512gb in cream with some phone accessories from the e-voucher. **AU230202-38617344** was my order number and I was stoked to see what Samsung had to offer. When I received it, turns out the side of the phone became a little scuffed and I asked for an exchange. The agent was kind enough and assured me the replacement process has been arranged. All I had to do is wait for the return label to be emailed and send it in. 

Now I don't know why a return label took almost a week to be sent, but It did on an afternoon and I sent it in as swiftly as I could. Both the s23 ultra and the a52s was mailed off, and I kept the tracking numbers.

The week after on a Wednesday, I got an email saying the refund has been completed. ??? I realized there must've been a mistake somewhere and contacted Samsung's live chat pronto. I asked for a replacement, not a refund, and the agent before also reassured me. The agent this time investigated the situation and acknowledged that they can see the refund request was clear, but their back offices marked it as 'lost in transit' and subsequently refunded me for it. Keep in mind both the phones showed up as 'delivered' on my AusPost tracking. 

I have asked multiple times for assistance, over live chat and live call, but none of the representatives had the authority to actually do anything about it, since the order is now ""complete"". They sent my case over to their 'VOC', whatever that is, and a week later today there is still no contact. 

I'm just beyond distressed and disappointed at this moment. I've lost 2 phones, 2-3 weeks of my time, and work opportunities. Such a big company and they had nothing to offer - no direct contact with their higher-ups, no ramification, and no adequate processes and quality checks in place to prevent incidents like this. I'd buy it again but, I am not paying $2,2k\~ to cover their mistakes and negligence when I paid $1569 rightfully during the pre-order. Samsung couldn't even offer me a voucher code to let me buy it again.

I don't even have a phone to use now, and it's thanks to me believing in Samsung in the first place. Again, I just have no words for Samsung's appalling processes and their negligence to customers. I don't want to ever buy from Samsung again, and this is just the experience I wanted to share.

So has anyone actually experienced subpar customer service and order negligence like this?? I'd be keen to hear people's thoughts. I'm also planning to buy the iPhone 15 ultra. Seriously screw Samsung. They also need to give me my crappy a52s back.

Thanks.

**UPDATE:** 

I received a call today, 3rd of Feb at 12:22PM. I assume it was from one of the many follow ups the Samsung reps raised for me. THE AGENTs MESSED IT UP AGAIN. 

He said, ""regarding the refund request raised for your phone, we just want to confirm if you have received it? Yes? Okay thank you!"" 👁️👄👁️ I intervened and complained that yes, I received the refund but that was not the point of this case at all. I NEVER specifically asked for the refund and only ever wanted AN EXCHANGE. So he ""changed his notes"" and said ""someone will be in contact with you asap"". No estimated date.",1677551861.0
Just switched from a iPhone 13 pro to the new S23 Ultra and I love it,99,11dbgbj,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dbgbj/just_switched_from_a_iphone_13_pro_to_the_new_s23/,35,"I'm writing this, to maybe help some people who are sitting on the fence of switching from an IOS device to an Android device.

I was an Apple user since the iPhone 4, which was a great time and a lot of innovation on Apple's part. However, since the iPhone XR and IOS 12, it felt the same for me every year. 1.5 years ago, I was pulled into buying a new 13 Pro, but I wasn't just excited anymore. I wanted something new. First I tried the Z Flip 4, but returned it because of the narrow screen (it's so narrow!). 

When I saw that the s23 Ultra came out, I was really tempted. I bought the new phone and gifted my 13 Pro to my girlfriend who doesn't really care about phones at all, lol. 

I'm using it now for a couple of days and I can say I'm in love. The notification system was weird for me in the beginning, but now I wonder how I could ever like the notification system on IOS. It's so fast and intuitive, you can directly answer in the notifications, you can scroll in widgets. I love watching movies on YouTube and Netflix. I can customize stuff how I want. It has great night shots, that I took last weekend are way better than on iPhone (to me at least, everyone has different taste).

Apple’s iPhones Winning Over Gen Z—and the World’s Premium Market,53,11dcdcf,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dcdcf/apples_iphones_winning_over_gen_zand_the_worlds/,226,"The Wall Street Journal

Trend puts pressure on rival Samsung, maker of high-end Android smartphones

SEOUL—Consumers around the world are increasingly choosing  Apple Inc.’s iPhones over high-end Android smartphones, with younger users seen as pushing the company toward the level of dominance in the market globally that it has enjoyed in the U.S.

From Europe to Asia, Apple’s market lead in the premium bracket  is growing, and polls show that people in their teens and early 20s,  known as Gen Z, increasingly see the iPhone as a must-have. Converts say  they are drawn by its design, cameras and AirDrop features for sharing  photos.

The trend is putting Apple’s chief rival, Samsung Electronics Co., under pressure and threatening the South Korean  company’s lead in the overall global smartphone market. Samsung has been  promoting its splashy foldable phones and 100x zoom cameras on the latest Galaxy S23 Ultra that brought a “wow” from Elon Musk on Twitter.

In Samsung’s backyard, where the brand’s Android smartphones have held sway, Apple’s clout has been growing since the company opened its first store in South Korea  in 2018. Apple now has four stores in the country, where its  mobile-payment system Apple Pay will soon become available for the first  time.

Around 52% of people age 18 to 29 in South Korea were using an  Apple smartphone as of 2022, up from 44% two years earlier, according to  polls by Gallup Korea. Samsung’s share of this age group slipped to 44%  from 45% in that time, the polls showed. For all older age groups,  Samsung phones remain most prevalent.

Chung Kyung-rim, a 22-year-old college student in Seoul, said nearly  all of her peers use an iPhone. Apple’s reputation for prettier designs  and good photos has stuck through the years, she said, though she thinks  Samsung’s devices have improved in looks and likes the diverse colors of Samsung’s latest flip phones, she said.

Apple’s rise among young people will likely help the U.S.  firm’s position in the high-end phone business that it has been leading.  Apple’s share of worldwide shipments of smartphones priced at $800 and  above grew to 76% last year from 65% in 2018, while Samsung’s declined  to 17% from 27%, according to Canalys, a tech-market researcher. China  has been one major driver of growth for Apple after U.S. sanctions crippled another rival, Huawei Technologies Co.

Samsung remains the world’s largest smartphone maker by overall  shipments, a title it has held since 2012. Even here, Apple is closing  in on its rival. Samsung’s market share has held roughly steady at  around 21% for the past five years, according to Canalys, while Apple’s  share climbed to 19% in 2022 from 15% in 2018.

High-end smartphones are critical for phone makers as they  bring in the biggest profits and showcase technological capabilities and  leadership, said Tom Kang, a Seoul-based director at Counterpoint  Research.

The pricier phone segment also represents a pocket of resilience in  an industry that has been sliding. Last year, global shipments of  smartphones priced above $800 grew 1%, while overall shipments of  smartphones fell 12%, according to Canalys.

A Samsung spokesman noted that preorder volumes for the recently launched Galaxy S23 smartphone series were higher than for the prior year’s models, with 60% of consumers choosing the most-expensive Galaxy S23 Ultra.

Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.

In the U.S., where Apple accounted for 77% of the  premium-smartphone market last year according to Canalys, one reason for  the popularity of iPhones among young people has been the prevalence of  iMessage, Apple’s messaging app that is widely used and designates different colors for iPhone users and Android users.

Elsewhere in the world that is seen as less of an edge because third-party mobile messengers are more mainstream, from WhatsApp in Europe to KakaoTalk in South Korea.

Young people around the world say they are attracted by  Apple-exclusive features such as AirDrop, which enables easy sharing  between iPhones between friends, and preferences for Apple’s photography  and design.

For years, Apple’s marketing has focused on taking cinematic photos and videos.

Today’s top-end iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smartphone both have  similar camera components and excel at capturing quality high-resolution  photos, said Choi Kab-soo, a travel photographer living in Seoul who  runs smartphone-photography classes.

Some differences in the color expression of the photos might  make people feel that Apple’s phones take better photos in everyday  settings, said Mr. Choi, who uses an iPhone.

Sarah Carrivale, a 24-year-old graduate student living in  Paris, has noticed that more people around her age are using  iPhones—around 7 in 10 she estimates.

She switched to an iPhone 12 two years ago, after using a  string of Android devices including ones from Samsung and a Chinese  brand. After taking a while to get used to the iPhone, she said she is  satisfied with its durability, ease of navigation and cameras.

“Once you get an iPhone, in a way there’s no turning back,” Ms. Carrivale said.

Across Western Europe, Android users under the age of 25 were  almost three times more likely to prefer Apple for their next smartphone  than older age groups, according to a poll last year by Canalys of  4,000 individuals from the U.K., Germany, Spain and Italy. Apple users  under 25 were more than twice as likely as Android users of the same age  to stick with their respective operating systems, the poll showed.

Apps on an iPhone feel faster and more glitch-free, even if the  specs are similar to an Android device, said Nicholas Leonzi, a  26-year-old retail worker in London. He tried out a Samsung Galaxy S21  Ultra in 2021, which had “cool” features  like charging his Galaxy Buds Pro earphones on the back of the phone. A  regular phone upgrader, he reverted back to Apple after a year and is using the latest version of the AirPods Pro.

Apple has also grown by building its products based on the same  operating system, helping strengthen user retention and brand loyalty.  Android smartphones have far more players in the mix because it isn’t a  closed operating system like Apple’s.

“As younger consumers grow stickier to the Apple ecosystem, it’ll become harder for Samsung to compete with Apple,” said                       Nicole Peng,          a Canalys senior vice president.

Samsung, which leads the Android segment, is working to catch up  by focusing efforts on making its products from smartphones to TVs to  appliances, and those of partner brands, work together in the most  hassle-free manner possible.

One bright spot for Samsung is that it is leading the foldable-smartphones category  it helped pioneer. Sales of foldable phones represent less than 1% of  the smartphones shipped worldwide today, but their increased popularity  could boost Samsung’s future position in the premium category, analysts  say. Apple has yet to announce any plans for foldable phones.

Lee Hye-jin, whose high-school-age daughter and son have owned  iPhones since middle school in Seoul, highlighted the iPhone’s appeal to  younger generations. She estimated that 7 out of 10 of her children’s  classmates are iPhone users.

“They say it’s more ‘hip’ to use Apple,” she said.",1677505999.0
"Calling all Routine users: Is there any way to have phone charge if battery is below a certain % only, and not stop until it hits the Protect Battery (85%)",3,11dxscn,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dxscn/calling_all_routine_users_is_there_any_way_to/,19," 

I hate that Protect Battery puts the phone back on charge as soon as it drops to 84% after reaching 85%, the defined protect battery threshold.

Got a routine set up for the daytime to enable Battery Protect if placed on a charger during certain hours (11am - 3am). I'll never need 100% charge after a certain time, so getting to 85% is fine after 11am.

What I'm trying to do now is set up 2 routines.

**Routine 1** is simple: enable Protect Battery during certain hours (11am - 3am).

Routine 2 - I don't think I can do it, but maybe I'm missing something obvious? I've written how I want it to work:

**Routine 2 - Check if phone battery is low enough to charge**

* If phone placed on a wireless charger, check battery level  

   * If battery level above / = X (say 65%), then  

      * Don't charge
   * If battery level below X (say 65%)  

      * Charge (phone will charge to 85% due to Protect Battery = True)
   * If battery level ***drops*** below X  

      * Charge (phone will charge to 85% due to Protect Battery = True)

The idea - when wireless charging: to have the phone NOT charge to 85%, stop, fall to 84%, start charging to 85%.... repeat cycle...

Instead, I'd like to charge to 85%, then not have the phone charge again until it falls below 65%. It sounds super simple so I'm convinced I'm just being stupid.",1677561654.0

&#x200B;

Basically, it's the title. I'm closing in on a upgrade for my current phone (It's currently the S21 5G model) and I'm going to be sticking with Samsung going forward. Nothing but positives about my current phone with the only issue being the charging port currently is very buggy. As in, only charges at certain angles and sometimes it just disconnects the charger (I believe it might just be the charging port not holding the charger cable in right is all, but easy to get around).

&#x200B;

I was looking at the Z Flip 4 due to the size when shut is a big positive, my current job means having a large phone in my pocket will increase the chances of accidental presses and damage to the screen, my current screen protector that has been fantastic from getting the phone nearly 2 years ago, (I got a fantastic deal on the newest release due to how long the account has been on the provider).

&#x200B;

I've watched some YouTube videos, but the issue I've found is a lot of the big 'TechTubers' tend to focus fully on the positives, be it personal preference or if they don't want to upset Samsung I don't know, but I know the original model and the Z Flip 2 had several issues which I thought I'd ask before going for the plunge.

&#x200B;

Have they sorted out the issue the hinge had with it failing fast in daily use?

Has the battery life been improved? I work 12 hour shifts and while I'm not on my phone the entire 12 hours, I saw several people complaining even in rest mode the battery drained fast.

How is the front screen in terms of usefulness? It's not one that needs any sort of squinting to see in darker lights is it?

How is the build quality on it? Samsung phones in my experience have been really well built and can take a bit of a beating, not saying I'm going to be throwing the phone at the wall, but there will be times a box may hit it, will it hold up with a case?

&#x200B;

I won't be upgrading until April so I also don't know if they are going to be releasing a Z Flip 5 soon, which is another question actually.

&#x200B;

Any advice/help would be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading through my wall of text.",1677545125.0
S23 Ultra terrible battery!,0,11eeutk,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11eeutk/s23_ultra_terrible_battery/,70,"I have had my S23 Ultra for a few weeks now and the battery life is absolutely nothing short of abysmal. I can only get a maximum of 4hrs of SOT, which is ridiculous for this flagship given the price I paid and that others are getting 8-9-10hrs SOT. It drains 1% for like every few minutes of usage.

I previously used Smart Switch to transfer from my S21+ and after reading that it can potentially cause battery drain I factory reset the phone. Nothing changed. Here are my settings:

- 120hz WQHD+
- Mix of WiFi 6 and LTE 4G (no 5g, good signal in my area)
- Brightness around 40%
- Bluetooth on (Galaxy Watch 4)
- Protect Battery (only charge to 85%)

I have a Bixby Routine set up to turn off wifi, mobile data, bluetooth and turn on airplane mode and battery saver, yet it still drains like 4-5% overnight. I can't imagine how much it will drain without that... I am 100% confident I have NO rogue apps draining my battery.

Coming from an s21+ (was getting 2h SOT, the only reason I upgraded was the battery life...) this feels like I got scammed by Samsung yet again. Do I have the shittiest luck in the universe or is samsung fundamentally bad? 

I apologize for the long rant and I'd really like some insight here because I am understandably pissed off when others are getting such crazy battery life.

[Serious] Notification icons need to be different colors,65,11d4lut,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11d4lut/serious_notification_icons_need_to_be_different/,22,"There was recently an update that went out that changed all of the notifications on my phone to be the same color.

For example, these are the old notifications: [here](https://i.imgur.com/POtNLB9.jpg).

And these are the [new ones](https://i.imgur.com/kE4FDW0.jpg)

Before, it was easy to scan down the list as a whole, pausing my eyes only on the color of the text. Familiarity of what's usually in that list (lets face it, we don't always clear *all* of our notifications) contrasts nicely with what's new to the list, especially when there are so many items I need to scroll down to see all of them. I'm able to memorize its contents with less effort. It was much easier to use. 

On the new color scheme, my old habits of scanning are obsolete. I'm having a difficult time. I've been trying to scan down the left side only to see what app it is, then I read the notification itself. It's a lot to take in. The only way to tell apps apart is a basic shape inside that purple bubble and my vision isn't what it used to be on these high density phone displays.  

I really don't like the change. You probably could have guessed that by now. If this was an A-B test, please dial me down. If this is the new default setting, please reconsider. If there's an easy way to get the colored title text back, even better. But I will still be peaved that it just changed to this without my consent. I still use old reddit for goodness sake.

If you're looking for a better solution, may I suggest slightly tinting the notification bars themself with the app default color. Nothing wrong with a little more variation of color in our lives. You can keep it subtle yet maintained the readability. 

TLDR: my phone is harder to use because of the new UI design",1677478620.0

Ive done a lot of research, but Im looking for slightly different input than what other people have asked for. Mind you, I dont drop my phone often or ever, its more of a security than a need.

The side question I have is MAGSAFE. Is it worth it? I havent looked into it before but I see quite a few cases with it, or the HALO from ESR. Any experience? Normally I just have a metal plate between my phone and case, but the change might be welcome, even after buying a bunch of accessories to make it worth my time. Any experience on that specifically is very welcome.

I see a LOT of clear cases available, but Im afraid of them being gross or nasty after a while of use, with yellowing color, scratches, and dust and grime getting in and being clearly visible.. has anyone had similar problems? Should this not be an active concern?

I would love a ""do all case"" but at the same time I dont want or need a tank - Im more interested just because having the ""full enclosure"" is an interesting concept for the outdoors or in general.

Given the prominence of phishing scams and cyber crime in 2023 this is totally unacceptable.There's nothing in the message that can be used to verify it's legit and support can't or wont confirm that Samsung sent it and it's legit while telling me the only way to actually get confirmation and book a new date would be to click a link that can't be verified as trusted.**This is a terrifying level of disregard for customer safety.**

So I ask to have my concerns raised in a case and have an email sent to me with some level of follow up at a minimum I'd like to know im actually going to receive the product im paying thousands of dollars for.

I own probably somewhere in the ball park of $10,000 worth of Samsung goods and am stunned by the utter indifference to customers digital safety as well as complete in ability to provide clear information on an order.To the extent that I'm no longer going to by future Samsung products and will likely end up cancelling this order ... assuming I ever get a support agent that can help me.  


Edit  
Tl;Dr  


Samsung need to seriously address their behavior and do a far better job of communicating clearly when their customers need to take action to ensure an order is delivered.  


Their current approach is so bad it can only serve to encourage customers to disregard sensible safety practices and place themselves at risk to ensure orders get delivered.",1677549494.0
Dear Samsung - Why are your TV remotes so horrible?,7,11dddm3,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dddm3/dear_samsung_why_are_your_tv_remotes_so_horrible/,8,"Just picked up another Samsung TV, a nice 85 inch one. The picture is great, but the controls, and particularly the remote, are just terrible. On my last new Samsung TV, I begrudgingly got used to not having a button to access the picture menu. This new remote is on a whole nother level of stupid. There are 4 streaming app buttons, and there is even a split screen button, but there isn't a source button? What moron at Samsung thought it was a good idea to prioritize having a prime video button but not a source button? At least it has solar charging now because it was so hard replacing the battery every two years or so. Next thing you know and we'll have to use the menu to change the volume. I wish there was a way to reprogram the buttons on the remote. One thing I did discover was that the source button on the older style remotes can actually change the source on my new TV.",1677508710.0

Some grievances switching from Pixel 7 Pro to the S23 Ultra,0,11e0mwd,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11e0mwd/some_grievances_switching_from_pixel_7_pro_to_the/,11,"First off, I do like the overall experience - especially from the hardware side. The phone just feels way more premium. (As it should considering the price difference)

-

**Still there are a few minor things that annoy me:**

* Volume buttons - This actually surprised me because when I first got the pixel I thought the placement was weird but over time it grew on me, It feels more natural now

**OneUi:**

* Folders - They just feel more thought through on the pixel, you can open and select the app you want with one hand instead with OneUi you must either shift the phone or use both hands (There is a setting in homeup on goodlock but the folder opening animation takes forever so it’s not usable in my opinion)
* App Drawer - There is no option to focus the search bar automatically
* App Drawer - No *real* app list (There is a setting on homeup but then you have ""priority apps"" pinned on top which makes the whole thing unusable)
* Quick Panel - The settings and power icons being at the bottom on the pixel makes quickly accessing them so much more convenient

Looking at the list - most of the ""issues"" could be solved by switching to a different launcher but for such an expensive phone I expect them to do better",1677571822.0

Modular phone cases?,1,11dn4hd,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dn4hd/modular_phone_cases/,4,"Hey r/Samsung! 

I'm currently awaiting my new S23 Ultra, and one of the most exciting parts of the phone shopping process was my plan to get a Peak Design case for my next phone. I knew I'd be switching, but it wasn't worth the startup cost for my current popsocket attachments until I was already buying a new phone anyway. 

As it turns out, the magnetic attachment system for PeakDesign will disable the most exciting feature of the new phone, that being the stylus. Does anyone know of any other relatively slim and sleek cases that have a full modular system of accessories? The ones that sound most interesting to me are: 

\-Wallet

\-Something to attach a pop socket to

\-Additional battery

\-Additional Storage

\-Additional ports, such as USB-C, ethernet, or HDMI

\-Items like rangefinders

I have been looking around both business and personal solutions providers for a case that may work, but all that I have found have turned out to either rely on magnets, rendering the stylus useless, or not having an option for popsocket/wallet/popwallet (which I currently use), and not having a popsocket or wallet option at all is unfortunately a dealbreaker. 

Really, if I could get a peak design case with no magnets but with access to all of the peak design accessories, I'd be happiest. Does anyone know of other good phone case systems with some modularity?",1677532554.0

The idea of RAM Plus is great but in practice it works terribly and it will hurt your battery life along with hurting the performance in the meantime. After I got my S23U it was literally the first thing I turned off and multiple people who have also gotten them have been helped in their battery life considerably since I recommended they do this also.

EDIT: Not saying this is going to be universally true for everyone obviously as everyone's needs and demands are different. My personal experiences (and no, I don't take pictures of all stats before and after I make settings changes to my devices) with previous models have shown improvements in performance and battery by both being able to turn it off if it's an option (added in One UI 5.0) or tuning it down to lower GB amounts. Because of those previous experiences it was something I turned off first getting my new devices and friends of mine have had similar improvements especially in battery after I recommended they turn it off.

Finally tried it this morning and it works great with an HDMI cable connection, but wireless is still an issue (at least using screen mirroring on a Fire Cube).

Switch Emulation (3DS and PSP also) is insane on the S23, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and it's GPU has really impressive performance 

Here are 2 gameplay videos I recorded. I just played the game for 20+ minutes while screen recording so towards the end there is thermal throttling with more than 3 characters on the screen. Throughout the 32 minutes of play time it used 5.8% battery.

I was so into the game the 2nd time i accidentally clicked stop and it didn't record but that was the best performance I got too since it was 30 frames the whole time without recording. 

First video I had the wrong audio setting so there is only BGM
https://youtu.be/wX8Jdb0723c

Second video has it all but is after 15 minutes of playing and recording.
https://youtu.be/9GYr0tyq0lA


There are 2 apps that you can choose to use for emulation: 

- EggNS (Paid - need a supporting controller or monthly sub)

- Skyline (Free)

- Skyline Edge (Patreon sub)

Skyline Edge is much more respectable since they built from the ground up using open source code and have been steadily improving game performance at a fast rate. They will at some point I hope overtake EggNS.

EggNS has more support and better frames on most games but that is because they have been around for longer, they began by taking code and profiting off it so they have a bad reputation. 

Personally whatever runs the games better in the end is what I'm going to be using. The EggNS developers have hinted at an iOS release but I'm doubtful it will run well since there are so many restrictions on iOS.

You will then need to follow guides to source your own key files, firmware and game roms. 

Other games I tried on EggNS: 

- Astral Chain 30 fps, it's pretty good but haven't gotten to intense combat yet

- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe starts at 60 fps but it drops to 40 fps

- Super Mario Bros U Deluxe 60 fps whole time

- Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Violet had issues maybe it needs a driver update cause others can run it

- Metroid Prime Remastered 60 fps

Anyone having issues with their S23 refusing to wireless charge?,1,11d9ygl,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11d9ygl/anyone_having_issues_with_their_s23_refusing_to/,5,"My wife got her new S23 2 weeks ago and is having problems with wireless charging. Every so often it just stops working. You put it onto a wireless charger and nothing happens, no messages, no acknowledgement that it's even trying to charge. Once this happens, the only way to fix it is a reboot. Once you reboot, it starts wireless charging as normal.

It doesn't stop charging part way through, if you put the phone on the charger it either starts working or nothing!. If it starts charging, it will charge OK until full. So it's not a temperature issue.

We have tried 4 different wireless chargers (a Samsung one, two from Amazon and an in-car one). They all work fine until the phone decides to stop recognising the chargers and then none work.

We have even tried  wireless power sharing from my S23 Ultra - nothing until a reboot.

If we plug in a charging cable, it will start charging OK, but still won't wireless charge.

It can happen at any battery level, we've seen it at 46%, 65%, 85% and 96%.

My S23 ultra uses the same wireless chargers without issue. We still have my wife's S21 and that has never had issues with the same chargers. So I am 100% sure it's not a charger issue.

We are wondering if it's a hardware of software issue. If it's hardware we need to get the phone returned and replaced, if it's a software issue then we can perhaps wait for Samsung to fix it.

You Know That 5Ghz Band Wifi6 issue most S22/S23 Ultras has been having? I may have found a good Temporary Solution for this.,0,11cqe66,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11cqe66/you_know_that_5ghz_band_wifi6_issue_most_s22s23/,12,"So I've been dealing with this for over a year now, trying everything under the sun to get this to work and I noticed that the majority of the time the issue happens with Asus Routers. And ironically I have one too, an RT-AX86U to be exact. 

So after a lot of research & trial and error, I found myself a good Temporary Solution that has been working for over a week now, with the WiFi signal lagging very briefly on a rare occasion, with maybe one time where I thought the issue came back but the whole internet was down instead 😅.

So here's what I did:

1. No Smart Switch was used to set up my S23 Ultra. Never liked it to be honest. I use Samsung Cloud and Google Drive via Google One to back up everything & I keep all my stuff in the cloud so it was only a re-download of what was needed. And I only brought back only my Messages & Call Log, cuz I'm forgetful 😅. I also manually added my WiFi to my phone, I didn't bring it over. I also cleared it from my Known WiFi Networks as well beforehand.

2. I switched the Router's software from ASUSMerlin back to Stock ASUS software, and updated it to the most STABLE version. Get it from ASUS directly & install it via the web gui.

3. I did both the HARD Factory Reset AND the NORMAL Factory Reset after I updated the router. There's two versions of it apparently. I did the version where you are physically pressing buttons to do it, and then I did the normal one on the Web Gui. Look up Hard Factory Reset *insert router name here* and it'll give you the way to do it for that particular version.

4. Went through Initial Router Set-up normally. Kept the same name & password, **stick to WPA2 security, you'll see why in a second**

5. *on the phone* Turned on Developer Settings on the phone, turned on Wifi Safe Mode.

6. Settings, Connections, WiFi, tap on the 3 Dots on the top right and choose Intelligent WiFi & turn off Prioritize Real-time Data.

7. *in Web Gui for the Router* Turn off 802.11ax/WiFi 6 mode. It's in Wireless. Make sure you do it for both bands (the first section will be which band you're editing, choose accordingly)

8. I actually kept on the 160 Mhz option for the 5Ghz because I want my speed dammit. Hasn't affected anything.

9. Switched my DNS (including IPv6) out of Cloudflare to a different DNS, I used Google. IPv4 is in the WAN section, IPv6 is in the IPv6 section (switch only if you actually have that one normally) **I didn't try different DNS options, Google was always my second choice, my focus was NOT using Cloudflare. Try different ones and see, I was always having issues with Cloudflare**

10. **for fun cuz why not** Restart everything. Phone, Router, and Modem if you're feeling fancy. Why? It doesn't hurt so might as well.



That's it. No Phone Mac. No Static IP on the phone. I'm on my 5Ghz Band consistently and it works almost flawlessly. Granted I would love to have Wifi6 available to me so I can get a better router with the 6Ghz Band as an option, but being able to use my 5Ghz in a stable way on my phone when I need that is more important to me. So there we go.",1677440176.0

Avoid Pixel phones,22,11bhlok,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11bhlok/avoid_pixel_phones/,58,"I've had my pixel 7 for under a month, and I've had to contact customer support on a few things, firstly my 3 months free YouTube premium to which they stated if you have already used any free trial then you cannot use this. I told them I have used a free trial but there's an option for another free month to which I have activated and sent the screenshot stating that isn't the issue. They told me well we can't do anything about it. 

My next issue was the trade in services and how my phone got rejected for screen burns, I sent them the pictures clearly showing there are no burns. They said they have escalated it to the highest tier and their response was because it has been returned we can't do much but here you go a free 40£ gift card. If this is there responses a month into my new phone what will it be when my phone experiences any hardware or software issues. To put it simply I don't trust this brand and i will not purchase a pixel phone anytime in the near future.

I will be switching back to Samsung as it's more reliable, has better stock apps, consistent pictures, quick menu and widgets are inconveniently too large with no added benefit, Google photos and gallery's are light years behind Samsung gallery in terms of customisation, Google keyboard and Microsoft as well. I've had to download a couple of apps because Samsung had irmt stock Google didn't for example Samsung pass, background media player, music player, that's actually good and customisable, Samsung notes, if your screen is off you can't hold to reduce the volume you have to tap it to reduce it or turn the screen on to hold it - I use this alot when I'm sleeping so it's a daily issue but exclusive to me. Not sure why WiFi and data are not separate options and sometimes weirdly turns on WiFi and connects me even though I've had it off, I had to install a new app that allows me to add documents or pictures as a shortcut on the home screen

As for what's good from the pixel: it's smoooth, above average battery life, I like the ss features, when the picture is good it's amazing, DND works amazing - miles ahead of Samsung, others I can't think of as of right now. 

All in all its a great phone but compared to Samsung I definitely have missed a lot of features and the customer service with Samsung is top notch compared to Google and this is why I am making the move, ofcourse backed with the downsides that I have with the phone.",1677319912.0

S23 Ultra Best Camera Setups - Issue with Indoor High Contrast Scenes Though,0,11c2te5,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11c2te5/s23_ultra_best_camera_setups_issue_with_indoor/,0,"Been comparing shots on the Samsung S23 Ultra I just got to my Note 20 Ultra.  As expected, it's not a night and day difference of course.  But in most scenes, the S23 Ultra produces moderately better results with the biggest difference when using Expert Raw in 50MP mode both JPG and RAW output (while the latter is going to be better for post editing.  I imagine 200MP is good too but I'm passing on that large of file size).

I found what I think though is a limitation in the camera software (or sensor).  Hopefully Samsung will fix it in a future update. It is for moderately low light indoor photos (like late afternoon and overcast with no indoor lighting turned on), but where you have a bright scene through the windows (like snowy mountains).  I imagine this happens in any room where you have bright window scene and not a bright room. 

The normal camera on the Note20 Ultra does much better metering and doesn't blow out the scene in the windows.  The S23 Ultra comes very close if using the normal camera in 12MP mode but at best it's equal to the Note in other tests the S23 Ultra totally blew out the window scene where the Note 20 Ultra didn't.  In this test scene it got a little worse in 50MP mode.  Then it gets even worse in Pro mode.  In Expert Raw it is bad too in some circumstances no matter what metering mode you select or exposure setting.  If you are lucky to get a decent shot in Expert Raw you can tweak the RAW output in Adobe lightroom, but it's still not as good as the normal camera mode on both phones! Where as most other shot scenes, the Expert Raw in 50mp mode is superior to the other modes and anything the Note 20 Ultra puts out, but you need to zoom in on the photo to really notice the difference.  (Safe to say if you're a Note 20 Ultra User (or S21/22 Ultra), you're not missing out much as the 200mp sensor in the S23 Ultra is as I expected part modest improvement and part a lot of marketing hype.)

Here's a comparison between normal 12mp camera output on Note 20 and S23 Ultra, then an Adobe Lightroom edited RAW image coming from Expert Raw on the S23 Ultra in 12mp mode.  

So the end conclusion is that in the current state of the software, on the S23 Ultra, for high contrast moderate natural light indoor shots like this, you are best just using the standard 12mp auto mode in the regular camera app. Whereas in most other situations you get the best quality with reasonable file size shooting in Expert Raw at 50mp.

For me and from many reports, this happens on all WiFi 6 networks, at home and at work and outside at the mall. It is not an issue with some particular configuration or router. It is an issue with the S23 Ultra WiFi software/driver and how it handles WiFi 6 networks. It does not seem happen on WiFi 5 or WiFi 6E from the reports and my experience, so switching to either will resolve the issue until Samsung fixes it.

Samsung, please acknowledge this bug at the least on your own forums and tell us you are going to fix it! Keeping us in the dark is worse than having an expected timeline to fix it.",1677274851.0

I decided not to keep it since i just can't get happy with it and have to trust my gut feeling here.

When i purchased, I paid just over £800 including a bunch of discounts and a trade in discount of £290 for my existing phone. (Which i have not yet sent to them)

I spoke to Samsung about returning the S23 Ultra , and they said they would refund me the £800 when i return the phone, and since i would not be sending my S20 to them, would be charged £290 from the trade in team.

I can't get my head around how this would make sense, because in my mind , The £290 discount would only be applicable if i kept the device , but since i'm cancelling altogether, Can't see how that is logical?

Am i getting this wrong?

As someone who is constantly trying to capture videos of my cats all day long, P7 Pro was just not a great device. Don't get me wrong, if the lighting was good, videos were decent. But most of my indoor shots had a lot of noise. Evening and night time videos were average at best unless I had got some good lighting setup.

Another issue I had was overheating and battery life, if I was shooting 4k videos, the battery just didn't last as long. Editing videos on the phone wasn't that great either... Tensor's subpar performance really made editing slower and the device would just get hot quickly. I saw that warning multiple times where it would say that the device is too hot to continue shooting and it had barely been 5 mins of 4K 30fps recording.

I came from iPhone 13 Pro before P7 Pro so all of these issues with video recording and performance annoyed me a lot. I didn't want to go back to Apple ecosystem because let's just say that I got bored from iOS and wanted to experience Android again.

I preordered S23 Ultra on the launch day and have had the device for about a week now. I'm really happy with the performance and video quality so far. Although I'm not a professional videographer, I have tried shooting some 8K clips of my cats, and I really like the end result, and even uploaded it to YouTube. I've been able to record 4K 60 fps for longer than 10 mins, and have not really seen any overheating warnings so far. Phone has just gotten warm once when I downloaded like 40GB of data over 5G network in one go.

Video editing feels smoother and a better display with S Pen really helps here with precision. I'm mostly editing for reels/shorts, and I've been very happy with the results so far. Battery life is much better and I charge my device once every day.

Only thing I would say that I miss from Pixel 7 Pro is shutter speed. Samsung is not too bad but I definitely feel the difference and before anyone points out, I've already installed the camera assistant app and turned on the faster shutter setting. But that's just for shutter lag, not shutter speed.

If my cats are moving too much, I am mostly taking a video and not a picture, so the shutter speed factor doesn't bother me as much. S23 Ultra is just a better overall camera experience for me.

I don't do any gaming on my phone so I can't say much about in that area.

Overall, I'm a happy S23 Ultra user.

I know this might sound like a rant, but I hope it doesn’t.  I would just like to provide my personal experience of why I no longer trust Samsung Mobile and then ask for your thoughts.

  

  \-	[Samsung Note 7 Recall](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-galaxy-note-7-return-exchange-faq)

2 (iirc?) recalls.  1 attempt to fix it then 1 to refund. This is a bad sign of poor internal processes.

  

\-	[Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Bricked](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-software-update-vi3-bricking-smartwatches/) 

Both my wife’s watch and mine bricked by a bad firmware update.  Out of warranty and Samsung Philippines initially refused to repair it even though Samsung firmware bricked it!  Had to raise this higher up the food chain to resolve but took weeks.

  

\-	Samsung Fold Screen Reliability

My Fold 3 main screen failed at 18 months old.  Anecdotal evidence from friends on social media seemed to suggest this is common, usually somewhere between 18 months to 24 months.  Some of my friends with Samsung folding screen devices have even had 2 different models and they have had both different models fail in this timeframe.  As it’s outside of warranty Samsung want at least $700 to repair it presumably so it can fail again at some point in the future?

   

This has now left me with 6 Samsung tags that appear to be useless as I’m not likely buying another Samsung phone.

  

Would be interesting to hear in the comments from people who have had any Samsung folding phone for a long period (at least 18 months?) to see how they feel about their reliability.

  

\-	[Samsung S23 Screen Wrinkle](https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-screen-wrinkle) 

(I’ve not suffered this, included as evidence of continued failure)

Although this is still new and no one really knows for sure how many are affected, it’s clearly a defect and the excuse from Samsung is on par with Apples “your holding it wrong”.  This is not a cheap phone and neither is the waterproofing/dustproofing process so, why has it only appear on these new models?  Manufacturing or design defect?  It doesn’t matter how minor it is, it’s still a defect and under UK law (at least when I was at school) a product had to be “free from minor defect” or could be returned.

  

Samsung have cost me well over $2000 in wasted money (lest we not also forget time!) and peripherals I no longer have a use for.  Given this I don’t think I can trust Samsung anymore as either their design, manufacture or QA (or combination) just seem to be failing and these are the issues I’m aware of, I’m guessing there might be more. 

  

How many of you feel like you can still trust Samsung Mobile?

It's sad that Samsung's Exynos processor failed so bad. Especially since my S10, when it was an amazing and powerful SoC.

But Samsung burnt European users with that chip (incapable to keep up with the competition, including system lags) it is questionable whether they will gain back their trust and mine.

I feel Samsung should acquire Qualcomm and let their own failed attempt of making an own chip go.

Rest of the world (RoW) doesn't have any idea what we had to deal with (as Europeans (for the past 3 years, we had been the guinea pig with their Exynos attempt and it failed lately.

Samsung generally should learn from it and make one chip for their phone anywhere else in the world and make a firm decision on what to do (Apple's own SoC as an example) and not create two classes of users on the same phone.

My S21 Ultra was in pretty good shape (aside from a cracked back) 

Never had any stuttering problems. Never was sluggish. I didn't even manage to fill up the 256gb capacity within 2 years of use. 

But, after a couple of weeks contemplating, I decided to pull the trigger and get the S23 Ultra.

To be honest, there's not a massive difference between the two phones that hits you in the face. The jump didn't feel anywhere as massive as it did when I went from the S9 plus to the S21 Ultra. 

Except for one aspect. Battery life. I had just gotten close to 9 hours of SoT with Wifi and Bluetooth both on. 

I mostly browsed Reddit, an hour in a half of Youtube, about 2 hours of gaming and some social media browsing.

This obviously isnt the heaviest of loads, but its the same routine I did with my S21 Ultra, and that phone only lasted me about 6 hours, 7 the most.

I just wanted to share to you guys how the S23 Ultra's battery holds up to usage mentioned above",1677185120.0

How to Enable Cast Support in Media Output Switcher (One UI 5.1),1,11aqifo,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11aqifo/how_to_enable_cast_support_in_media_output/,1,"The One UI 5.1 changelogs specifically called out ""**Media output for Wi-Fi speakers**"" feature stating: *""If you want to continue listening to music on Wi-Fi speakers via Spotify Connect and built-in Chromecast, just open Media Output from the Quick Access Toolbar, not from the Music app""*

But after getting the Galaxy S23+ running One UI 5.1 I was disappointed when I first tried to switch playback from my phone to Google Home speakers using the 'Media Output' button in notification shade. It showed all my Google Cast devices, but it took several seconds to switch output to them and it didn't have any of the rich cast experience with album art and song information, just showed text 'Default Media Receiver' or something.

But tonight I accidently discovered a non-obvious setting page where you can change it from what appears to be Miracast mirroring, to actually use the Google Cast protocol. Apps need to be updated to support it, but it works great! Think it's only YouTube and YouTube Music at the moment.

**Instructions (screenshots here:** [**https://imgur.com/a/hG8QEMP**](https://imgur.com/a/hG8QEMP)**)**

1. Click on 'Media Output' in notification shade
2. Click the 'Gear' in top-right
3. Click on Wi-Fi speaker playback preference
4. Select 'Casting' to use Google Cast instead of the default 'Mirroring'

My Experience After 1 Week From An iPhone 12 Pro Max,17,11a7k94,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11a7k94/my_experience_after_1_week_from_an_iphone_12_pro/,47,"I recently switched from the iPhone 12 Pro Max and made a post about my switch and some folks said I will be back to using an iPhone after and that I am in a honeymoon phase and blah blah blah. Well one week later, I have never been happier about making the switch. This has been my experience so far after a week.

Battery Life: I started out with a decent  SOT of around 5 hours. I have to say this is not really bad and as someone who works a lot and does not mind charging my phone once or twice a day, SOT is sufficient for me. But I decided to see if I could push it further. So I decided to optimize my phone and here's how I did it:

1) I never charge the phone when the phone is hot. This is very important even than turning on to protect the battery.

2) I also realized adaptive brightness was overestimating the brightness I needed. So I set up modes and routines for the times I get home and around the times I sleep. Around the time I get home, my At home mode sets the brightness to 4% which is more than enough for me. Around the time I sleep, I have a routine set to turn off the phone if I plug the charger in to keep the phone cool and it also turns to protect the battery on to keep the phone's battery from stress overnight.

3) I also make sure to close apps I am not using anymore so the ram doesn't try to keep it open + RAM uses a significant amount of battery.

After doing this SOT went from 5 hours to 9-11 hours depending on the use which involved watching Netflix(the screen is so good lol), using social media, reading, etc.

Camera: 

The camera out of the box was great but it somehow didn't process some pics properly imo. But somehow it's like it got better overnight. The pics coming out of the phone are crazy good now not even kidding. Some Portraits shots  I took the other day of my kid look like they were professionally photographed. I can't explain what I did to improve the camera so much but one thing I noticed is that the more lighting the better. Also being stable when taking a photo really helps. won't decide to go into shutter lag because that's a whole post of its own.

Other:

Apps run smoothly with like one lag because I have labs turned on (which they did mention could cause some lags), SPen has been amazing been using it more times than I can count, pop out the pen, write something on AOD, pin it, and never forget.

 Review after a week:  I still think this is the best phone out there. With all the features it provides. There are many other things that I could go on and on about the phone but that will make this post too long. Not saying it's perfect, I don't expect it to be and after one week it's one of the best purchases I have made in a while.

PS: One thing I really dislike about the phone is Samsung emojis. Pure shit. Thank God Android is highly customizable. I currently use iPhone emojis on my S23 Ultra. Please leave any more tips that can help me better optimize my phone. Thanks",1677183468.0
S23 Ultra: does the S-pen colour match your phone?,84,119v517,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/119v517/s23_ultra_does_the_spen_colour_match_your_phone/,145,"Hi all, I've had my S23 Ultra for almost a week now and am super happy about my device. I absolutely love it! However, and this might be nitpicking, I know, I noticed that the S-pen does not match my device. When purchasing my device, I was in doubt between green and lavender. Ultimately, I liked the green more so ordered that one (the 512GB version). However, upon receiving my device, I noticed that the top of the S-pen is black, not green. I checked the Samsung website again and I can see a green top on the S-pen there, which I like much more. I contacted Samsung and they asked me to send them pictures of my S-pen and the pictures from the website. They will get back to me later.

Now I'm left wondering. Am I the only one with the wrong colour? Here you can see what I am talking about: https://imgur.com/a/T8OYnr2

I absolutely love this phone. I've had LG phones consistently over the last 10 years ago. I've had Samsung phones in the past but it's been a while. The battery life on the v40 has degraded to a point that I can't continue using it and it's starting to lag and bog down.

I bought the v40 within the first few months of it coming out, and intend to hold my position that buying flagship phones are the best way to future proof to keep it for years. I'm looking at Samsung now because LG is dead and gone in the phone market. Can't stand Apple crap and have zero interest in that.

How does the Ultra 23 match up with the v40 in terms of size? I'm reading mixed feelings on the curved screen of the Ultra 23. I have a tiny scratch on the v40 but after all these years it still basically looks brand new. I'm a paramedic so my phone is out in the field a lot, and I need something with good screen protection. I've never used anything on the v40 but feel like I'll have to with the S23?

Is the Ultra worth the upgrade over the Pro? I don't care much a out the camera to be honest. I'm more interested in a slightly larger screen and the most battery life I can get.",1677980395.0

Z fold 4 to S23 Ultra,44,11iiqng,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11iiqng/z_fold_4_to_s23_ultra/,23,"I've been using the z fold 4 since its release. I have to say, I was pretty satisfied  considering some of the short coming of a fold. But I instantly fell in love with s23 Ultra, from both a specs standpoint, but also design standpoint. So I finally caved and bought one via trade-in with Samsung. The last few hrs have been standard setup. But there are a few things I've noticed so far since I've been kind of testing the 2 devices. App optimization is so much better on the s23 Ultra, and surprisingly, sound quality via speakers is better, but not by much. Both have good speakers. Content is obviously better on the Z Fold. Gaming has been the toughest aspect to judge so far.... the more immersive experience on the Z fold is nice, but the richer screen quality and better battery drain on the s23 have also been nice. Yes, technically, you will get better performance on the s23. But both SOC will be plenty for gaming. Im honestly kind of torn on which one I want. The minimal camera testing I have done has been pretty underwhelming for th s23, as standard photos between the two look pretty similar, although the portraits came out better on the s23. Still more testing to go. Is anyone testing both and found a clear winner? I plan on testing night mode and Dex tonight and will carry the s23 ultra for the day today to see how it does during my daily schedule.",1677977396.0
My Samsung customer service and warranty experience,20,11ifdly,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11ifdly/my_samsung_customer_service_and_warranty/,10,"My first experience with Samsung warranty is with my Galaxy S8. I updated the firmware and it can no longer access wi-fi. Sent it into Samsung to fix, after about 3 weeks I called them and ask them for a follow up, and they told me they just got my phone and will working on it now. Which was a lie, because I had tracking and it showed Samsung received it in 2 days . They shipped it back to me the next day.  Most likely they forgot about until I called and follow up. I was phone-less for almost 3 weeks.

My second experience was with my QN90B TV.  One day my TV suddenly had a white line across the screen. I called Samsung to use my warranty. I sent them several pictures and i circled where the line was on the screen. The woman denied my claim and saying she and her manager can't see the white line. Naturally, I got very angry and cuss at them for being blind and after 10 mins, I just hanged up.  I tried again the next day, and got a different person and he approve my claim and said he could clearly see the white line, and they sent a TV repair man over to my house to replace the screen.  The TV repair man said the white line was noticeable and it needed to be replace.  Not sure why I got denied the first time. >\_>

This third experience just happened. I pre-ordered the Black Galaxy S23 on Feb 14 to go pick up at Samsung Galaxy Experience store at Yorkdale Mall in Canada.  I received an e-mail saying there were Canada wide shortage, and it will be delayed 2 weeks.  Its been 2 weeks, I called into Samsung and they can't help me, because Samsung Galaxy store is a separate entity from Samsung online, even though I ordered online.  Tried calling Samsung store at Yorkdale, several times today and nobody picks up, but the machine keeps tell me to call 1800SAMSUNG (But they don't know).  I can literally walk into any carrier store or Best Buy right now and see that they have stock.  I know people that place their order days after me and days after release, that already got their phone. So...... yeah....... I'm kind of questioning if there is a shortage?  So, right now they don't know what happen to my order, and nobody from Samsung can help me. My options is to keep waiting, or cancel and reorder and I lose my 100$ preorder coupon and the double storage promotion.  (They wouldn't even make an exception for my case)

I've read about issues before but I've now experienced the trade in hoop-jumping that a lot of people have dealt with. 

I did everything to a T. I took other's advice and snapped a few pictures of my S22+ trade in before sending out. I used the original box, I put the packing slip inside, I did a factory reset, I wrapped it tightly, I taped every edge of the box and it was sent in before cut off. On top of that, this phone was in excellent condition, not a single flaw to be found.

In the midst of a crazy Friday at work, I see an email that they are charging me $115 because my screen is cracked. Immediately out of my mouth was ""not a f*king chance"". Unless this box was put under a 200 pound box in the FedEx truck, there is no way there is a crack. This phone could have been sold ""like new"".

I called Samsung, and to be fair it was a quick and painless process to get my money back but, I shouldn't have had to do so in the first place! I told the rep that I was being charged for damage to my trade in device and as soon as I said there is absolutely no way that there was damage and that I had pictures, he immediately said ""we are sending you an email to dispute your charge back"". I didn't have to fill out anything. The email just said that I wasn't getting charged. I didn't have to send any proof or anything. What's the point of this? To see how many people don't call in?

**Performance**

This thing is butter smooth. CPU is very fast, I didn't have any lags whatsoever. No stutter, micro lags or anything. Using the dev options to check, the refresh rate is between 24 Hz and 120 Hz. It's also 24 Hz on the Always On Display. Doesn't matter that much for me, because I set it up so that I have to tap the phone for it to show a few seconds (so I can't say anything about battery regarding AOD). I'm not a mobile gamer, but tried Asphalt 9 on max settings to see how it performs, and it was running with 120 FPS the whole time (as you would expect from a flagship phone).

**Storage**

Having so much storage is very nice (coming from a 32 GB A series phone) and 256 GB is more than enough for me. System takes 37.45 GB on my phone (default apps not included).

**Battery**

Battery is, while not insane, good. I charged on 3rd of March at around 6am. It took roughly 50 minutes with my ""old"" 15 W Samsung charger to charge to 85 % from 15 %. I plugged it in a few minutes ago (it's 11:50 am, 4th of March) because it was at 10 % with 4 hours of screen on time and a lot of Spotify running in the background. But, considering I only charge to 85 % and it did run 1 day, 5 hours without charge (so a lot of standby), I'd say it's good, and it's definitely enough for me. Watching YouTube for 2 hours 10 minutes took 7 %.

**Camera**

Also, not as insane as the camera from the Ultra (especially regarding zoom), but very good. I used it to film 30 minutes of 4k 60 FPS video on my grandmas birthday and, while it got warm of course, it didn't overheat or something. Also, I did some pretty good shots with portrait mode and the 3x zoom lens, they look fantastic. Filming at night does look ok (depends on the light, of course). Pictures are pretty good at night using night mode. You can't switch between lenses when filming with 4k 60 FPS or 8k 30 FPS, it's possible with everything below. (You can film in 1080p 120 FPS with Pro Video Mode, but you can't switch between lenses there either).

My last post was on background usage and I was able to get 3 hours SOT, obviously it was meant to compare previous phones I've used but it's pretty good!

This post will be a day of use from 10AM- 4PM at the Zoo using 5G, with Photo taking, Videos, Navigation and light social media. I was on light performance mode the whole time. I got home with still 33% left and 2hr 30 hrs SOT.

I think if you weren't such a heavy user you'd be able to stretch to 4-5 hours screen on time being out and using the phone. Basically lasting 9am to 6pm easily. 

Here are some photos, https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/rKykarG1NFKf 

only 1-2 turned out blurry due to motion of animals and lighting! Definitely not as bad as I thought it would be, but the time it takes to take a photo definitely feels longer coming from an iPhone especially in less optimal lighting, and photos don't turn out as clear in these conditions. 

My average usage so far with my S23 has seen it last an average of 5hours SOT. I have also not really noticed much of a difference with light performance mode, both in terms of OneUI performance and also battery life, (Can comfortably emulate games at 30/60fps on light performance)

- 2-3 hours when doing heavy Switch Emulation, Utorrent background usage, Spotify background usage, Bluetooth devices

- 3-5 hours when out using Nav, camera, social media, 5G

I shower while my phone is on the counter and play music. Today while I got off the shower I grabbed the phone and boom dropped it on the bathroom counter. Ok, it happened before ill just pick it up but when I tried to use it...

From S22 Ultra to an S23+ I LOVE IT!,50,11hk8ct,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11hk8ct/from_s22_ultra_to_an_s23_i_love_it/,37,"Hello all, I talked about it for a while and yesterday I acted on it. I'll sum it up, I had an s21 Ultra, and loved it but hated the size. Best buy had a killer deal and I got an s22 ultra for $15 paid for outright(essentially a free new phone). But I wanted an S22+ because of the form factor. Fast forward to now, and I wanted to buy an S23+.

I went to my local best buy and bought an S23+ by trading in a cracked galaxy s7 I got from eBay for $40. I also received a $100 Best Buy gift card. I did the bill credit thing but I don't mind. Today I sold my s22 ultra for $600 cash and am very happy! In the end, after I subtract the taxes, the new phone case, the s7 phone, and the $199 balance over the next 3 years, I'm up $220 cash and a $100 gift card plus a free galaxy s23+! (I also turned the cracked s7 into a Verizon store for the $800 bill credits)

Onto the phone! I LOVE the battery life! I thought it was overhyped but it's real! 

My S22 Ultra SOT was 4-6.5 hours MAX with 1080p mode(not 1440p) It was always dying with minimal use.

My S23 Plus SOT is 7-9 hours! Same usage! It's insane how a 300mah small battery can outperform an Ultra series phone. I can only imagine the S23 ultra sot! 

Overall it's an upgrade for me! I like the smaller size, I have 256gb now vs the 128gb, love the battery life and I LOVE the flat screen! I am so happy with the device! Samsung did a great job! This is honestly how the S10+ was to me when I first got it!

Opinions on the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra for Digital Art / Clip Studio Paint?,17,11hjd6w,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11hjd6w/opinions_on_the_galaxy_tab_s8_ultra_for_digital/,3,"Hi all,

I am a hobby artist. I occasionally sell commission work.

One piece of technology I have wanted since 2010 was a portable digital sketchbook.

I have always used Windows for my computer OS. I use a Samsung Galaxy phone currently. I have enjoyed Android far more than iOS.

The idea of having a tablet that would pair up easily with my current workspace is exciting. I'm excited about the idea of being able to use my preferred art program of Clip Studio Paint with all the brushes and assets I have for it already rather than Procreate. I also like that CSP pairs with your smartphone while using a tablet for easy access to shortcuts. I know CSP requires a separate subscription plan to use on a tablet versus a desktop, but that's not really an issue to me.

I also recall in one review that certain Wacom pens work with the S8 Ultra. I think it's just the Wacom One pen, but I would be interested in hearing about any other options. 

I currently use a Huion Kamvas Pro 16 screen tablet to draw on. It stays tethered to my desktop.

So many artist buddies recommend an iPad Pro and iPencil combo. The only real advantage an iPad and iPencil have is less visible lag/stroke latency. I find it more convenient to stick with Windows OS items.

The S8 Ultra does have visible lag in the S-pen on review videos during screen extension use, as well as within Clip Studio Paint if a high stabilization setting is turned on.

If any artists have a screen tablet similar to a Cintiq or Huion as well as an S8 Ultra, does having a portable tablet help your workflow? How easy is it for you to transition your active files/projects between your desk space and mobile space? Do you notice a lag in the pen strokes in certain programs or settings? 

I am also hoping that incorporating this tablet into my study space will help me with college studies, as I imagine that annotations and notes will be easier with the dual workspace option and marking directly on the document.

What other recommendations or suggestions would you have? Thanks for reading!",1677887850.0

So I'm curious of this scenario.  I primarily carry my work phone as my team will need me 24x7.   Because of this I use the ""Secure Folder"" feature and add WhatsApp (personal phone number), Facebook, etc on it.   I do this because work cannot access the secure folder.  The MDM can delete the secure folder, and unlock the mainphone, but not the ""Secure Folder""     Its also a nice way to keep work/personal separated. 

So my question is.......

if I add my personal phone line to my eSIM,  is there two different text messaging/phone call icons?  Would I be able to keep one inside the ""Secure folder""",1677784444.0

Sorry for spelling mistakes

It all started when I wanted to leave Apple so I started looking and only heard good things about Samsung. It was all good util i wanted to change Icons a few years ago and had to resort to Hex_ to do so and even then it wasn't like any other Android its was so hard then I started noticing other stuff that was locked for example E-Fuse that wasn't well disclosed or that you need samsung headphones to clear the phones cache. Then I started to understand that they tricked me to get into a closed ecosystem like apple. Then I started to litsen to Luise Rohsman on YouTube and even if I don't like everything he stands for I agree that a 1500$ device that I HAVE PAYED FOR should me MINE and not locked. Then they stoped having Micro SD card expansion. Then tried to stop right to repair and removed the Charger that came in the box. They have had so many chances to be good but the choose to not do them. Thats the Phycologick definition of **EVIL**!!!!!!! They are one of the Worst Companies hand in hand with Meta, Apple, Google, Nestle, Kellogg's and Amazon. I am feed up with their behavior. Thats why I am leaving Samsung for good! Not even a SSD from them!

Galaxy A33 + Buds2 for 284€ or wait for Galaxy A34,1,11g9hjj,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11g9hjj/galaxy_a33_buds2_for_284_or_wait_for_galaxy_a34/,2,"Hi, i currently have a Galaxy A20e that i use as a secondary work phone (this is, the intended use is light: check emails, some videocalls, browsing, social media and maybe snap some photos to scan documents). I want to upgrade, as A20e is slow as hell and is soon to lose security support (this is key for me). My main phone is an iPhone, but i usually buy Samsung for me and my family when i need Android alternatives (my parents have A52S and A53 for instance), mainly due to the extended update support.

Checking the Samsung website i saw a deal on the Galaxy A33, where you get the phone (in blue, 6+128) with free Galaxy Buds2 (in black) for a total of 284€ (normally the pack is 299 but there is a 5% off coupon). You could take it a bit lower in educational discounts for 249€ but without Buds2.

I know that the Galaxy A34 is close to be released this month, but will probably cost more than this (at least 369€, and rumors say a possible increate to 420-430€). It should also have a Dimensity processor instead of Exynos. A33 should still have 3 year of OS-upgrades + 4 security patches in store, which is really nice for me. New phones released this year from other manufacturers will have less support than A33.

Would you say buying the A33 with this offer is worth it for the intended use, or should i wait for the A34?

Pro Tip: eSim can make your phone trackable if lock or stolen,108,11g7s4m,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11g7s4m/pro_tip_esim_can_make_your_phone_trackable_if/,86,"For all those unaware if your telecoms carrier allows you to use eSims I highly recommend that you switch to one if it's not an inconvenience.

Samsung phones require a password to turn the phone off if you're phone is locked. If someone who stole your phone removes your sim card it will be harder to track your cellphone. With an eSim installed as long as you have power and data, your phone will be able to send you its location. Otherwise, you're relying on Samsung Smarthings Find Network which only uses other Samsung phones' Bluetooth networks to help you find your phone.

This also works great for travelling too. I use an eSim app and just pay for data when I travel. It's easy to install and when the plane lands I can turn off airplane mode, toggle the new eSim on and have data right away.

This only works for people who have password/fingerprint/faceid locks on their phone and who don't need to move their sim around to other devices.

I hope this helps make Samsung phones less desirable to steal or keep!

Thinking of switching to S23 ultra (lifetime IPhone User),9,11fc3uw,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11fc3uw/thinking_of_switching_to_s23_ultra_lifetime/,47,"Hey guys and girls, you probably get so many of these posts but I thought I would post as I'm at a big crossroads for myself.

I'm a lifelong Apple user, IPhone 14 pro max, AirPods Pro/ Max, AirTags, Apple Watch Ultra and the list goes on. But the problem is I'm just bored, it works, it all works seamlessly with little problems but at the same time with no excitement anymore, and as someone who loves tech and new features Apple just isn't doing anything innovative for me.

I tried the S22 ultra when it came out last year along with the watch 4 classic and I did really like them but I was so far into the Apple ecosystem that everything just felt odd and eventually I changed back. Now the S23 range is out and my head won't let me go 5 mins without thinking about switching.

But if I'm truly honest with you l'm slightly afraid to do so. My entire family is Apple and iMessage is just so easy, I use FaceTime for weekly calls and AirPods Max are the only headphones l've found that both look good on me and actually sound good with best in class NC and Transparency mode. Also the Apple Watch ultra is something I couldn't live without, I hated Apple Watch before the ultra came out due to battery, but the battery life and water resistance as well as (in my opinion) best interface on a smart watch is just great for me.

Even with all this though I still want to switch, from people with experience of just the S22/23 ultra or of both Apple and Samsung, could you give me some suggestions on how to make the transition easier or benefits of doing so. I know I could still use my AirPods Max but does anyone have any problems using them with android? Same with the watch 5 pro. How does it compare to the ultra? I've watched countless videos on the matter but I always find that YouTubers perspectives are a little biased and usually not as extensive as a full time user of the products.

Samsung Galaxy S23+ Touch Sensitivity.,0,11f16pr,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11f16pr/samsung_galaxy_s23_touch_sensitivity/,40,"Hey all.

I just got my Samsung Galaxy S23+ a couple of days ago coming from a OnePlus 6T. I put a Spigen glass screen protector on it the moment I took it out of the box before turning it on. This is the first Samsung phone I've had since the Galaxy S6.

And something is really killing the experience for me. The touch sensitivity. It feels so unresponsive. I find that swiping left and right feels slow and swiping up and down feels like it's dragging. The OnePlus felt so fluid and smooth but this takes a lot of effort to scroll having to put much more pressure and drag further to make it move. Even then sometimes it barely scrolls and sometimes misses my touch at all. It seems so inconsistent. And I've turned on the setting for increased sensitivity for screen protectors. 

Is anyone else noticing this or just me? It feels awful and honestly I'm thinking of sending it back and getting a new OnePlus. It just ruins the experience.

Also the settings are a mess in comparison. So many things I've had to search the internet to find because of it and some things just seem not as good. The OP has much more customization for a start. And a lot of things in OneUI feels counter intuitive.

Does anyone know if the notification tone and SMS tone can be separate? If so I haven't found it. I prefer the app and SMS tone to have separate sounds? Does anyone know if it can be done? It's stupid if not. No custom accent colours either which is stupid, just basic ones. On OP I could customise it at an RGB colour code level.

Also does anyone know if the auto play for videos can be turned off for the gallery?

Thank you all for reading and thank you in advance for comments and assistance. My main thing here that's driving me mad is the sensitivity and responsiveness.

*Edit:* so to all the folks suggesting it's likely the screen protector, I removed it and tried using the phone without it. No noticeable difference. OneUI just feels clunky compared to what I'm used to and the fingerprint scanner never recognises mine first time despite re-registering it. Unless I press down harder than I'm used to and a good amount of pressure at that. I guess I'm quite unhappy with the Samsung which feels overpriced for the experience.

*Edit2:* so after changing the ""drawing"" settings in ""developer options"" as suggested by *Darkwayn* down below I can confirm over the last couple of days since doing that that the UI feels so much more fluid and responsive as a result. I'm whizzing through gestures, apps and menus barely any different from the smooth experience on the OnePlus I was used to. Huge difference. Why that isn't Samsung's default I'll never know because it feels so much smoother and nicer. I guess folks who have never experienced an interface as smooth as OnePlus' out of the box wouldn't feel it. Shout-out to Darkwayn in the comments, check his comment for instructions if like me the lack of smoothness in the UI was/is killing the experience for you. I still have a few niggles with the settings, some limitations and a few stupid design choices by Samsung but I can bear it for now. The whole video gallery thing seems to be Android wide apparently since A12, however some stocks allow you to turn off autoplay while Samsung does not. If Google/Samsung continue to disappoint maybe I'll consider another option in a few years come replacement time. Hopefully someone finds some of the help in this thread useful if they ever face similar problems or disappointment.",1677669460.0

Finally got my Book 3 Ultra! Some performance notes.,3,11exmt3,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11exmt3/finally_got_my_book_3_ultra_some_performance_notes/,10,"I put together my thoughts so far here since I did not see much about the performance and battery life online yet. The laptop has been pretty decent to use, I was looking for a laptop that can handle a decent bit of gaming but also has a good battery life and is portable, this seems to work so far.

## Build Quality / Overall thoughts

Personally, I feel the build quality is good. I noticed a bit of screen wobble and the screen is super reflective. Having a numpad felt a bit weird in terms of positioning my hands. This is the first time I have thought that a trackpad can be ""too big"", I felt the keyboard was so far away sometimes, lol. The keys are also a bit shallow. But I did find myself getting used to these quirks over time.

## Performance

I was a bit disappointed to hear the fans running loud when playing a game or when running benchmarks but the game performance was not even close to what I was expecting from a 4070 (even though it runs at such a low wattage). That was until I switched on the High Performance mode in ""Samsung Settings"" app (it was already in high performance mode in windows battery settings), the performance was so much better after that! I only tested Dota 2 so far, I went from \~55-60 FPS to 100+ FPS with max settings in native resolution. Time Spy scores: [https://imgur.com/a/iY7Z7xB](https://imgur.com/a/iY7Z7xB)

## Battery Life

I have been playing with the laptop just for a few hours now, so I do not have any solid numbers. I saw \~35% decrease in battery when using it for 2 hours at half screen brightness, on the Quiet performance preset in Samsung Settings, adaptive refresh rate enabled, a second screen connected via SuperDisplay, have 15-20 chrome tabs open and playing videos constantly. I would estimate the battery life to be around 5.5 to 8 hours for medium to light use.

## Pros, Cons and Final Thoughts

* Pros
   * Display. Can't think of a better looking display, OLED looks so beautiful and 120 Hz looks plenty smooth
   * Form Factor. Pretty light for a (3.95lb/1.8kg) for a 16 inch laptop and pretty thin as well
   * Performance. I would list this as a Pro if I am not considering the price, the laptop is plenty capable, but a proper gaming laptop would have a way better performance (probably at the cost of battery life and/or good form factor)
* Cons
   * Price. The 'i9 processor' and 'RTX 4070' seems to be contributing more to the price than the performance imo.
   * Keyboard. The lack of a good key travel, the number pad making the overall layout awkward, the weirdly positioned arrow keys do leave quite a bit of room for improvement in this area.
   * Speakers. Really? Bottom facing speakers in 2023 on a $3k laptop? Having such a nice display makes this even more painful for me personally. But overall not too bad.

The screen just might be what makes me keeps this laptop. Let me know if you like to know something about the laptop or if there are things you want me to run on this laptop.",1677656169.0

Is the S23 Ultra seriously that much more scratch prone than past devices (like the S22U)? Never have used a screen protector before.,1,11end2f,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11end2f/is_the_s23_ultra_seriously_that_much_more_scratch/,27,"I've been using smartphones since the original G1 and I've never used a screen protector. No cracks from drops, and no unreasonable scratches other than the micro scratches accumulated from general use. I'm looking at my S9+ that I used for like 4 years with no protector and it looks fine to me still. Little cuts here and there, nothing that I'd actually notice in general use.

Now I'm hearing that the S23U is so incredibly scratch prone that a screen protector is mandatory? Is it *really*? Like I understand micro scratches, they happen over time and it's whatever, but people are making this sound like something new. Like the Scratchpocalypse.

I like cases, always use one, but screen protectors always struck me as a hassle, and I'm having a hard time finding one I can use with the case I've already ordered. Whichever one I check it's either the thing bubbles a lot, doesn't work with cases, or ruins the fingerprint sensor (which I use a lot). I'd be willing to pay a lot for a perfect screen protector, but it doesn't seem to exist, so I'm rapidly leaning into skipping it altogether.

How I Got A Factory Unlocked S23 Ultra for $306,1,11emhlm,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11emhlm/how_i_got_a_factory_unlocked_s23_ultra_for_306/,5,"First off, I always buy my phones outright, factory unlocked so they don't have specific carrier branding or carrier bloatware.  I then use them with a good reputable MVNO for about half the monthly cost of a service plan from a major carrier with the only downside being slower speed when you're around thousands of other people like in a stadium.

The carriers entice people with shiny new objects with gazillion dollars off deals because (a) they know the majority of consumers can't afford to buy the phone outright and (b) they make the big discount a monthly credit spread over 24-36 months so unless you have 3 or 4 lines with the carrier, you will be paying out the nose for the service which is where they make their profit so they can afford to give you low payments on the phone.  Try to leave before the 24-36 months and you have to give the phone back or pay it off and lose the remaining credits from the discount.

Google Fi and Spectrum have the best deals. Google Fi is more straight forward though. $600 off the phone at purchase and you just have to stay with them 120 days (Google Fi is a T-Mobile MVNO and also uses US Cellular Towers when it makes sense.)  Spectrum is convoluted about getting your money back (there's debate whether it's a service credit that they'll refund the unused portion of if you leave them after 60 days or a Visa Cash card 2 months later or whatever. and you'll get a Spectrum branded phone.

At Samsung Store, the pre-order deal cost with trading in my Note 20 Ultra was $807 including a $46 additional educational discount which pretty much anyone can get. Pass. (Almost forgot, they also threw in for Note 20 trades a free watch that you could net about $125 for on Ebay, so technically net would have been around $680.)

Google Fi, the phone was an instant $600 off or $599 ($649 with tax) 512GB model.  The monthly plan is, with a coupon for a $20 credit, a total of $60 more over the minimum 4 months than the comparable US Mobile plan I use.  So that's a total cost of $709.  The big catch is my Note 20 Ultra is mint condition. Sold it for $483.33 on Ebay.  Net after Ebay fees and shipping cost is $403.  So the net cost on upgrading to the S23 Ultra is $306.  And the best thing is I'm not stuck with a specific carrier branded phone (so it will have better resale value) and don't have to pay for a $40-$70 overpriced plan at Verizon, T-mobile, or AT&T for 2-3 years (I use no more than 10GB a month so a $20 15GB plan for a Verizon MVNO suits me great. Coverage is the same, speeds always adequate(even \*real\* high-speed 5G supported not basically relabeled 4G LTE speed all the time) and great customer service.)",1677624352.0

S23 Ultra terrible battery!,0,11eeutk,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11eeutk/s23_ultra_terrible_battery/,70,"I have had my S23 Ultra for a few weeks now and the battery life is absolutely nothing short of abysmal. I can only get a maximum of 4hrs of SOT, which is ridiculous for this flagship given the price I paid and that others are getting 8-9-10hrs SOT. It drains 1% for like every few minutes of usage.

I previously used Smart Switch to transfer from my S21+ and after reading that it can potentially cause battery drain I factory reset the phone. Nothing changed. Here are my settings:

- 120hz WQHD+
- Mix of WiFi 6 and LTE 4G (no 5g, good signal in my area)
- Brightness around 40%
- Bluetooth on (Galaxy Watch 4)
- Protect Battery (only charge to 85%)

I have a Bixby Routine set up to turn off wifi, mobile data, bluetooth and turn on airplane mode and battery saver, yet it still drains like 4-5% overnight. I can't imagine how much it will drain without that... I am 100% confident I have NO rogue apps draining my battery.

Coming from an s21+ (was getting 2h SOT, the only reason I upgraded was the battery life...) this feels like I got scammed by Samsung yet again. Do I have the shittiest luck in the universe or is samsung fundamentally bad? 

I apologize for the long rant and I'd really like some insight here because I am understandably pissed off when others are getting such crazy battery life.

I own a Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro since 2020. This phone was great in Performance and especially battery life, but unfortunately i've been having really bad ghost touch issues with it since 1.5 years ago with other issues as well. With that said I'm trying to avoid Xiaomi entirely.

I kept looking for a another midrange phone. Galaxy A73 was too expensive where I live (510$), and I heard about Performance issues about the A53 so it didn't really convince me.

I decided in the end to pick the A52s 5G, only to be given a used galaxy S10+ (exynos) as a gift recently. I like the S10+'s screen and Build material and also it's quite fast. But I tested its battery capacity with AccuBattery and it gave me 85% (3500 mAh) so I'm having doubts about its longevity.

I'm currently deciding whether I should stick with the Galaxy s10+ (exynos) ? Or Sell it and buy the A52s 5G ? I don't really care about updates unless they actually correct big issues with the OS, and I mainly use my phone to watch Youtube, take notes and take calls. And I could really use a good battery life like the note 9 Pro's and a bright screen outdoors especially when I'm traveling.

What do you guys think is the best decision ?",1677602870.0

The S22 Ultra only has minor cosmetic damage. The reason for the trade-in is my battery is terrible for some reason; it doesn't last a work day. 

I got the S23 Ultra and sent in my S22 U. About a week later, I receive an email from Samsung that the S22 U was ineligible for full credit because the body or screen was cracked. Knowing the device was in very good condition when I sent it to them, I opted to have them return it instead of accepting $150 or so in credit for the device. 

After I chose to have it returned, I called Samsung's customer service to find out if there would be any options available to me if the phone does come back to me cracked or otherwise damaged and all I had for proof was my story vs theirs. The customer rep was super helpful. Apparently they make video recordings for their ""triage reports"" (or something) so he was able to find video evidence that my phone was not damaged. That was a relief. He offered me a $50 code to be emailed to me for all the trouble; the email never arrived. 

A few days later, I receive my S22 U and it's in the same condition I sent it out. Except! Samsung took my S Pen. I am sorry I did not make any video recordings of the device I was going to trade in.

Hi guys,

I want to buy a Samsung S23 Ultra but only the 8GB RAM variant is in stock where I live. I don't really game on my phone, just scroll a lot of Youtube and maybe some movies on Plex, but have a lot of tabs opened in Chrome (not sure if those take up a lot of RAM, while they're not displayed).

So I don't think i'm an extreme power user.

The 256 GB storage seems more than enough for my needs, I have the same on my current phone and I've never had the need to clean the space even once in 4 years.

My question is this:

Is 8 GB still okay to get as the 256 is exactly what I want, or should I wait for the 12GB RAM variants to be back in stock?

Is RAM much more important in 2023?

&#x200B;

I don't mind to have only 2-3 apps in memory before they close, what I don't want, is for the phone not not be as snappy next year, because of the lack of RAM.

**Still there are a few minor things that annoy me:**

* Volume buttons - This actually surprised me because when I first got the pixel I thought the placement was weird but over time it grew on me, It feels more natural now

**OneUi:**

* Folders - They just feel more thought through on the pixel, you can open and select the app you want with one hand instead with OneUi you must either shift the phone or use both hands (There is a setting in homeup on goodlock but the folder opening animation takes forever so it’s not usable in my opinion)
* App Drawer - There is no option to focus the search bar automatically
* App Drawer - No *real* app list (There is a setting on homeup but then you have ""priority apps"" pinned on top which makes the whole thing unusable)
* Quick Panel - The settings and power icons being at the bottom on the pixel makes quickly accessing them so much more convenient

Astro mode has some loose ends,5,11dyfgc,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dyfgc/astro_mode_has_some_loose_ends/,3,"So I've been using the astro mode the last couple days and it is awesome, but of course, some things could be improved (or maybe i'm using it wrong?;


-S-pen shutter in Expert Raw. I know using a 2sec timer works too, but it's not the same.

-Screen preview i think it's called in real cameras. 
Where if you're busy focusing, the screen will completely zoom in on a tiny part of your live screen preview so you can check the focus.

Usually things are very dark in your preview while astro shooting, so it helps being able to pick a random star and use that to focus on. 
Because of the lens switching i assume it's a fruitless effort to actually zoom in and focus. And then zoom back out. 

Focus peaking is nice but I'd rather preview it myself. Moon shots already prompt this same sort of preview when stabilising at 100x (in the camera app, not expert raw).


-The constellation overlay is cool but every time i've used it, it was off a fair bit. And when i saw some galaxy i could potentially zoom in on (i know) like M44 or something.. that's when i remember finding it while zooming in is going to be hell.


-The 4/7/10 min exposure feature may be broken. Not sure what happens but instead of one 7min exposure, tonight i notificed it gave me two 3,5min exposures. So 2 raw files and 2 jpegs. I do remember it's not the first time I've heard this.

Also took a 10min exposure and as far as exif data goes, that shot doesn't exist. 

Could all be due to built-in overexposure protection or something like it, but maybe it's actually buggy.

"Calling all Routine users: Is there any way to have phone charge if battery is below a certain % only, and not stop until it hits the Protect Battery (85%)",3,11dxscn,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dxscn/calling_all_routine_users_is_there_any_way_to/,19," 

I hate that Protect Battery puts the phone back on charge as soon as it drops to 84% after reaching 85%, the defined protect battery threshold.

Got a routine set up for the daytime to enable Battery Protect if placed on a charger during certain hours (11am - 3am). I'll never need 100% charge after a certain time, so getting to 85% is fine after 11am.

What I'm trying to do now is set up 2 routines.

**Routine 1** is simple: enable Protect Battery during certain hours (11am - 3am).

Routine 2 - I don't think I can do it, but maybe I'm missing something obvious? I've written how I want it to work:

**Routine 2 - Check if phone battery is low enough to charge**

* If phone placed on a wireless charger, check battery level  

   * If battery level above / = X (say 65%), then  

      * Don't charge
   * If battery level below X (say 65%)  

      * Charge (phone will charge to 85% due to Protect Battery = True)
   * If battery level ***drops*** below X  

      * Charge (phone will charge to 85% due to Protect Battery = True)

The idea - when wireless charging: to have the phone NOT charge to 85%, stop, fall to 84%, start charging to 85%.... repeat cycle...

Instead, I'd like to charge to 85%, then not have the phone charge again until it falls below 65%. It sounds super simple so I'm convinced I'm just being stupid.",1677561654.0

Fraudulent and no responsibility taken. Beyond disappointed and shocked.,8,11dukox,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dukox/fraudulent_and_no_responsibility_taken_beyond/,29,"Hi people,

I've posted this on Samsung Forums but just wanted to share my experience here.

So I've been buying from Samsung since the s4 line years and years ago. However, this is the first time I purchased from the official site. I bought the s23 during pre-order and used the trade-in program, but what happened over 2-3 weeks has completely made me lose faith and trust in Samsung. I will never buy a phone from them again.

I ordered the s23 ultra 512gb in cream with some phone accessories from the e-voucher. **AU230202-38617344** was my order number and I was stoked to see what Samsung had to offer. When I received it, turns out the side of the phone became a little scuffed and I asked for an exchange. The agent was kind enough and assured me the replacement process has been arranged. All I had to do is wait for the return label to be emailed and send it in. 

Now I don't know why a return label took almost a week to be sent, but It did on an afternoon and I sent it in as swiftly as I could. Both the s23 ultra and the a52s was mailed off, and I kept the tracking numbers.

The week after on a Wednesday, I got an email saying the refund has been completed. ??? I realized there must've been a mistake somewhere and contacted Samsung's live chat pronto. I asked for a replacement, not a refund, and the agent before also reassured me. The agent this time investigated the situation and acknowledged that they can see the refund request was clear, but their back offices marked it as 'lost in transit' and subsequently refunded me for it. Keep in mind both the phones showed up as 'delivered' on my AusPost tracking. 

I have asked multiple times for assistance, over live chat and live call, but none of the representatives had the authority to actually do anything about it, since the order is now ""complete"". They sent my case over to their 'VOC', whatever that is, and a week later today there is still no contact. 

I'm just beyond distressed and disappointed at this moment. I've lost 2 phones, 2-3 weeks of my time, and work opportunities. Such a big company and they had nothing to offer - no direct contact with their higher-ups, no ramification, and no adequate processes and quality checks in place to prevent incidents like this. I'd buy it again but, I am not paying $2,2k\~ to cover their mistakes and negligence when I paid $1569 rightfully during the pre-order. Samsung couldn't even offer me a voucher code to let me buy it again.

I don't even have a phone to use now, and it's thanks to me believing in Samsung in the first place. Again, I just have no words for Samsung's appalling processes and their negligence to customers. I don't want to ever buy from Samsung again, and this is just the experience I wanted to share.

So has anyone actually experienced subpar customer service and order negligence like this?? I'd be keen to hear people's thoughts. I'm also planning to buy the iPhone 15 ultra. Seriously screw Samsung. They also need to give me my crappy a52s back.

Thanks.

**UPDATE:** 

I received a call today, 3rd of Feb at 12:22PM. I assume it was from one of the many follow ups the Samsung reps raised for me. THE AGENTs MESSED IT UP AGAIN. 

He said, ""regarding the refund request raised for your phone, we just want to confirm if you have received it? Yes? Okay thank you!"" 👁️👄👁️ I intervened and complained that yes, I received the refund but that was not the point of this case at all.

Samsung's order processes are so bad they're an active cyber security risk to their customers,0,11dtq2q,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dtq2q/samsungs_order_processes_are_so_bad_theyre_an/,2,"This morning I received an SMS from a cell phone number I'd never seen before telling me my requested Samsung delivery date wasn't available and to click a link to rebook.

Now I have ordered from Samsung and am waiting for a product however, I get tons of delivery notification scams and am wise enough to initiate a chat with support.

Where I'm told not only can they not verify for me that they sent a message but that if I want to set a new requested date I'd need to click the link in the SMS provided.

Given the prominence of phishing scams and cyber crime in 2023 this is totally unacceptable.There's nothing in the message that can be used to verify it's legit and support can't or wont confirm that Samsung sent it and it's legit while telling me the only way to actually get confirmation and book a new date would be to click a link that can't be verified as trusted.**This is a terrifying level of disregard for customer safety.**

So I ask to have my concerns raised in a case and have an email sent to me with some level of follow up at a minimum I'd like to know im actually going to receive the product im paying thousands of dollars for.

This is not an option, Samsungs processes mean that sending me an email to be followed up can't be done.

I own probably somewhere in the ball park of $10,000 worth of Samsung goods and am stunned by the utter indifference to customers digital safety as well as complete in ability to provide clear information on an order.To the extent that I'm no longer going to by future Samsung products and will likely end up cancelling this order ... assuming I ever get a support agent that can help me.

&#x200B;

Basically, it's the title. I'm closing in on a upgrade for my current phone (It's currently the S21 5G model) and I'm going to be sticking with Samsung going forward. Nothing but positives about my current phone with the only issue being the charging port currently is very buggy. As in, only charges at certain angles and sometimes it just disconnects the charger (I believe it might just be the charging port not holding the charger cable in right is all, but easy to get around).

&#x200B;

I was looking at the Z Flip 4 due to the size when shut is a big positive, my current job means having a large phone in my pocket will increase the chances of accidental presses and damage to the screen, my current screen protector that has been fantastic from getting the phone nearly 2 years ago, (I got a fantastic deal on the newest release due to how long the account has been on the provider).

&#x200B;

I've watched some YouTube videos, but the issue I've found is a lot of the big 'TechTubers' tend to focus fully on the positives, be it personal preference or if they don't want to upset Samsung I don't know, but I know the original model and the Z Flip 2 had several issues which I thought I'd ask before going for the plunge.

&#x200B;

Have they sorted out the issue the hinge had with it failing fast in daily use?

Has the battery life been improved? I work 12 hour shifts and while I'm not on my phone the entire 12 hours, I saw several people complaining even in rest mode the battery drained fast.

How is the front screen in terms of usefulness? It's not one that needs any sort of squinting to see in darker lights is it?

How is the build quality on it? Samsung phones in my experience have been really well built and can take a bit of a beating, not saying I'm going to be throwing the phone at the wall, but there will be times a box may hit it, will it hold up with a case?

&#x200B;

I won't be upgrading until April so I also don't know if they are going to be releasing a Z Flip 5 soon, which is another question actually.

The truth (literally!) no one tells you about Android vs iOS updates,177,11dkmpz,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dkmpz/the_truth_literally_no_one_tells_you_about/,89,"I was not sure where to post this observation, but since I love Samsung's version of Android, I would like to leave it there for people who are interested.  


Switcher here. I was an iPhone user for more than 10 years but in 2022 I switched to Samsung for a second time. Partly because of being impressed by an old Samsung phone from 2012. You will probably not believe but it still goes to Internet, uses latest Chrome version (or any browser of your choice) and even installs most apps from Google Play. And it is on KitKat 4.4. I mean, it is the same age as the iPhone 5 that already cannot open any webpage on it's old iOS 10 and install any app (maximum that could have been installed, original was iOS 6 that is the same age as Android 4)  


Generally, one of the major reasons I switched was being tired of constant updates.   
Often I see people on the web and on Reddit particularly writing that ""no Android manufacturer has such software support as Apple"". As an ""Apple veteran"" I have went through 13 major updates on different devices (iPad 1, iPad Air 2, iPhone 4, 5, 6s, 11 Pro). And the way they serve the update didn't change throughout the years: Apple literally downloads it to your device without your consent when you plug the phone on charger and wifi, then out of the blue (often when you are very busy and do not have time for that) they ask ""Install update now or at night"", and you can only postpone it by clicking ""at night"". Then you can delete it from storage but every time a newer version comes out ( for example 15.0.1, 16.1.3 etc) it will download again.  


Most people will just hit ""install"" and it will download. It is a hit-or-miss, but usually every update is a slowdown comparing to the original version. Users often face bugs with every single update. And there is no way back, you cannot revert to the original version if you don't like the one that you had installed.  


Sure thing, updates bring security, better experience, blah blah blah and also bring users to the store in search of a new phone. It is a simple psychological trick everyone knows at Apple, and considering how hard it is to get free of the ""ecosystem"", users usually rush to get a newer iPhone.  


But what if you just do not update on iPhone or iPad? First two years it is going to be OK. After that time sites usually start to lag and not open pages correctly, or the load time increases significantly. This is especially a problem of all banking apps due to them constantly updating all the site code. In the same time, this issue DOES NOT EXIST ON ANDROID. Yes, you get me right: iOS update means everything. If you do not update, you are out. Because all the browsers on iOS are based on Safari's WebKit, so literally if you download Chrome it will change nothing except the skin, sites won't open and there are gonna be even more slowdowns. After 3 years developers usually drop support for older iOS versions and require newer ones. And 3 years literally means 3 major iOS versions, thus people on iOS13 cannot get most new apps and app versions on their devices unless they update or buy a new iPhone if their ones does not support the update.  


In fact, you are in Matrix and are provided with ""two pills"": have a slow but up-to-date iPhone or have a fast but unsupported one.

On the other hand, on Android you can install any modern app (and browser) even as it turns out, on 4.4 KitKat which is the similar age as the iOS 5.1.1 that is installed on my mentioned above iPad 1.   


In fact, getting no update on Android phone does not mean you will have problems with apps and services. It just means that you don't get newer OS features and have a less secure phone. But if you know at least something in tech, does it even make sense? Modern Android is already dummy-proof enough not to allow the install from untrusted sources, as well as you won't probably get anything if you use up-to-date browser (which you do).  


In comparison, how does it feel to have constant updates on Apple? You basically become a beta tester for anything Apple wants to install on your phone. You have to deal with lags, bugs, slowdowns and incompatibility issues. And you cannot ""roll back to original app version"" like on Android or just re-flash the original OS unless you have SHSH blobs (you surely won't have those at the moment you already updated). And in the end you have to buy a new phone because yours does not work as you wish it to. Also you cannot just go and install old app ""apk"" (.ipa in iOS) from web, because ""security"" and copyright, unless you saved the ones tied to your Apple ID on your PC or Mac.  


I have lots of examples of how updates killed my iDevices, but will tell you only the recent one. Since 2014 I was effectively making music on my iPad. I had even bought official Apple lightning to usb adapter to be able to connect my midi keyboard. After I installed the iOS 15 update which I didn't want to do but had to (one of the apps stopped updating) the midi protocol stopped working, synth does not connect and GarageBand and similar apps freeze when it tries to connect and... nothing in the end. Like, WTF. I was making music and suddenly cannot. And you know what is the worst? I cannot go back and this device is now called ""obsolete"", so it does not get any updates or patches except some security ones that do not fix such issues. Now my only choice is to buy a newer iPad and HOPE the problem is fixed already, yet I am sure it is not and the device itself is not worth it.  


So next time you see ANYONE bragging that Android has no updates, show them my post and see their reaction. Because personally I would rather get no system updates than all these untested, poorly optimised and useless yearly updates like it is on Apple devices.

Apple’s iPhones Winning Over Gen Z—and the World’s Premium Market,53,11dcdcf,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11dcdcf/apples_iphones_winning_over_gen_zand_the_worlds/,226,"The Wall Street Journal

Trend puts pressure on rival Samsung, maker of high-end Android smartphones

SEOUL—Consumers around the world are increasingly choosing  Apple Inc.’s iPhones over high-end Android smartphones, with younger users seen as pushing the company toward the level of dominance in the market globally that it has enjoyed in the U.S.

From Europe to Asia, Apple’s market lead in the premium bracket  is growing, and polls show that people in their teens and early 20s,  known as Gen Z, increasingly see the iPhone as a must-have. Converts say  they are drawn by its design, cameras and AirDrop features for sharing  photos.

The trend is putting Apple’s chief rival, Samsung Electronics Co., under pressure and threatening the South Korean  company’s lead in the overall global smartphone market. Samsung has been  promoting its splashy foldable phones and 100x zoom cameras on the latest Galaxy S23 Ultra that brought a “wow” from Elon Musk on Twitter.

In Samsung’s backyard, where the brand’s Android smartphones have held sway, Apple’s clout has been growing since the company opened its first store in South Korea  in 2018. Apple now has four stores in the country, where its  mobile-payment system Apple Pay will soon become available for the first  time.

Around 52% of people age 18 to 29 in South Korea were using an  Apple smartphone as of 2022, up from 44% two years earlier, according to  polls by Gallup Korea. Samsung’s share of this age group slipped to 44%  from 45% in that time, the polls showed. For all older age groups,  Samsung phones remain most prevalent.

Chung Kyung-rim, a 22-year-old college student in Seoul, said nearly  all of her peers use an iPhone. Apple’s reputation for prettier designs  and good photos has stuck through the years, she said, though she thinks  Samsung’s devices have improved in looks and likes the diverse colors of Samsung’s latest flip phones, she said.

Apple’s rise among young people will likely help the U.S.  firm’s position in the high-end phone business that it has been leading.  Apple’s share of worldwide shipments of smartphones priced at $800 and  above grew to 76% last year from 65% in 2018, while Samsung’s declined  to 17% from 27%, according to Canalys, a tech-market researcher. China  has been one major driver of growth for Apple after U.S. sanctions crippled another rival, Huawei Technologies Co.

Samsung remains the world’s largest smartphone maker by overall  shipments, a title it has held since 2012. Even here, Apple is closing  in on its rival. Samsung’s market share has held roughly steady at  around 21% for the past five years, according to Canalys, while Apple’s  share climbed to 19% in 2022 from 15% in 2018.

High-end smartphones are critical for phone makers as they  bring in the biggest profits and showcase technological capabilities and  leadership, said Tom Kang, a Seoul-based director at Counterpoint  Research.

The pricier phone segment also represents a pocket of resilience in  an industry that has been sliding. Last year, global shipments of  smartphones priced above $800 grew 1%, while overall shipments of  smartphones fell 12%, according to Canalys.

A Samsung spokesman noted that preorder volumes for the recently launched Galaxy S23 smartphone series were higher than for the prior year’s models, with 60% of consumers choosing the most-expensive Galaxy S23 Ultra.

Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.

In the U.S., where Apple accounted for 77% of the  premium-smartphone market last year according to Canalys, one reason for  the popularity of iPhones among young people has been the prevalence of  iMessage, Apple’s messaging app that is widely used and designates different colors for iPhone users and Android users.

Elsewhere in the world that is seen as less of an edge because third-party mobile messengers are more mainstream, from WhatsApp in Europe to KakaoTalk in South Korea.

Young people around the world say they are attracted by  Apple-exclusive features such as AirDrop, which enables easy sharing  between iPhones between friends, and preferences for Apple’s photography  and design.

For years, Apple’s marketing has focused on taking cinematic photos and videos.

Today’s top-end iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smartphone both have  similar camera components and excel at capturing quality high-resolution  photos, said Choi Kab-soo, a travel photographer living in Seoul who  runs smartphone-photography classes.

Some differences in the color expression of the photos might  make people feel that Apple’s phones take better photos in everyday  settings, said Mr. Choi, who uses an iPhone.

Sarah Carrivale, a 24-year-old graduate student living in  Paris, has noticed that more people around her age are using  iPhones—around 7 in 10 she estimates.

She switched to an iPhone 12 two years ago, after using a  string of Android devices including ones from Samsung and a Chinese  brand. After taking a while to get used to the iPhone, she said she is  satisfied with its durability, ease of navigation and cameras.

“Once you get an iPhone, in a way there’s no turning back,” Ms. Carrivale said.

Across Western Europe, Android users under the age of 25 were  almost three times more likely to prefer Apple for their next smartphone  than older age groups, according to a poll last year by Canalys of  4,000 individuals from the U.K., Germany, Spain and Italy. Apple users  under 25 were more than twice as likely as Android users of the same age  to stick with their respective operating systems, the poll showed.

Apps on an iPhone feel faster and more glitch-free, even if the  specs are similar to an Android device, said Nicholas Leonzi, a  26-year-old retail worker in London. He tried out a Samsung Galaxy S21  Ultra in 2021, which had “cool” features  like charging his Galaxy Buds Pro earphones on the back of the phone. A  regular phone upgrader, he reverted back to Apple after a year and is using the latest version of the AirPods Pro.

Apple has also grown by building its products based on the same  operating system, helping strengthen user retention and brand loyalty.  Android smartphones have far more players in the mix because it isn’t a  closed operating system like Apple’s.

“As younger consumers grow stickier to the Apple ecosystem, it’ll become harder for Samsung to compete with Apple,” said                       Nicole Peng,          a Canalys senior vice president.

Samsung, which leads the Android segment, is working to catch up  by focusing efforts on making its products from smartphones to TVs to  appliances, and those of partner brands, work together in the most  hassle-free manner possible.

One bright spot for Samsung is that it is leading the foldable-smartphones category  it helped pioneer. Sales of foldable phones represent less than 1% of  the smartphones shipped worldwide today, but their increased popularity  could boost Samsung’s future position in the premium category, analysts  say. Apple has yet to announce any plans for foldable phones.

Lee Hye-jin, whose high-school-age daughter and son have owned  iPhones since middle school in Seoul, highlighted the iPhone’s appeal to  younger generations. She estimated that 7 out of 10 of her children’s  classmates are iPhone users.

“They say it’s more ‘hip’ to use Apple,” she said.",1677505999.0

I was an Apple user since the iPhone 4, which was a great time and a lot of innovation on Apple's part. However, since the iPhone XR and IOS 12, it felt the same for me every year. 1.5 years ago, I was pulled into buying a new 13 Pro, but I wasn't just excited anymore. I wanted something new. First I tried the Z Flip 4, but returned it because of the narrow screen (it's so narrow!). 

When I saw that the s23 Ultra came out, I was really tempted. I bought the new phone and gifted my 13 Pro to my girlfriend who doesn't really care about phones at all, lol. 

I'm using it now for a couple of days and I can say I'm in love. The notification system was weird for me in the beginning, but now I wonder how I could ever like the notification system on IOS. It's so fast and intuitive, you can directly answer in the notifications, you can scroll in widgets. I love watching movies on YouTube and Netflix. I can customize stuff how I want. It has great night shots, that I took last weekend are way better than on iPhone (to me at least, everyone has different taste). 

I can really recommend this phone as a good entry to Android!",1677503303.0

Anyone having issues with their S23 refusing to wireless charge?,1,11d9ygl,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11d9ygl/anyone_having_issues_with_their_s23_refusing_to/,5,"My wife got her new S23 2 weeks ago and is having problems with wireless charging. Every so often it just stops working. You put it onto a wireless charger and nothing happens, no messages, no acknowledgement that it's even trying to charge. Once this happens, the only way to fix it is a reboot. Once you reboot, it starts wireless charging as normal.

It doesn't stop charging part way through, if you put the phone on the charger it either starts working or nothing!. If it starts charging, it will charge OK until full. So it's not a temperature issue.

We have tried 4 different wireless chargers (a Samsung one, two from Amazon and an in-car one). They all work fine until the phone decides to stop recognising the chargers and then none work.

We have even tried  wireless power sharing from my S23 Ultra - nothing until a reboot.

If we plug in a charging cable, it will start charging OK, but still won't wireless charge.

It can happen at any battery level, we've seen it at 46%, 65%, 85% and 96%.

My S23 ultra uses the same wireless chargers without issue. We still have my wife's S21 and that has never had issues with the same chargers. So I am 100% sure it's not a charger issue.

We are wondering if it's a hardware of software issue. If it's hardware we need to get the phone returned and replaced, if it's a software issue then we can perhaps wait for Samsung to fix it.

Anyone else and similar experience?

[Serious] Notification icons need to be different colors,62,11d4lut,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11d4lut/serious_notification_icons_need_to_be_different/,22,"There was recently an update that went out that changed all of the notifications on my phone to be the same color.

For example, these are the old notifications: [here](https://i.imgur.com/POtNLB9.jpg).

And these are the [new ones](https://i.imgur.com/kE4FDW0.jpg)

Before, it was easy to scan down the list as a whole, pausing my eyes only on the color of the text. Familiarity of what's usually in that list (lets face it, we don't always clear *all* of our notifications) contrasts nicely with what's new to the list, especially when there are so many items I need to scroll down to see all of them. I'm able to memorize its contents with less effort. It was much easier to use. 

On the new color scheme, my old habits of scanning are obsolete. I'm having a difficult time. I've been trying to scan down the left side only to see what app it is, then I read the notification itself. It's a lot to take in. The only way to tell apps apart is a basic shape inside that purple bubble and my vision isn't what it used to be on these high density phone displays.  

I really don't like the change. You probably could have guessed that by now. If this was an A-B test, please dial me down. If this is the new default setting, please reconsider. If there's an easy way to get the colored title text back, even better. But I will still be peaved that it just changed to this without my consent. I still use old reddit for goodness sake.

If you're looking for a better solution, may I suggest slightly tinting the notification bars themself with the app default color. Nothing wrong with a little more variation of color in our lives. You can keep it subtle yet maintained the readability. 

TLDR: my phone is harder to use because of the new UI design",1677478620.0

The S23 is insane for game emulation!

Switch Emulation (3DS and PSP also) is insane on the S23, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and it's GPU has really impressive performance 

Here are 2 gameplay videos I recorded. I just played the game for 20+ minutes while screen recording so towards the end there is thermal throttling with more than 3 characters on the screen. Throughout the 32 minutes of play time it used 5.8% battery.

I was so into the game the 2nd time i accidentally clicked stop and it didn't record but that was the best performance I got too since it was 30 frames the whole time without recording. 

First video I had the wrong audio setting so there is only BGM
https://youtu.be/wX8Jdb0723c

Second video has it all but is after 15 minutes of playing and recording.
https://youtu.be/9GYr0tyq0lA


There are 2 apps that you can choose to use for emulation: 

- EggNS (Paid - need a supporting controller or monthly sub)

- Skyline (Free)

- Skyline Edge (Patreon sub)

Skyline Edge is much more respectable since they built from the ground up using open source code and have been steadily improving game performance at a fast rate. They will at some point I hope overtake EggNS.

EggNS has more support and better frames on most games but that is because they have been around for longer, they began by taking code and profiting off it so they have a bad reputation. 

Personally whatever runs the games better in the end is what I'm going to be using. The EggNS developers have hinted at an iOS release but I'm doubtful it will run well since there are so many restrictions on iOS.

You will then need to follow guides to source your own key files, firmware and game roms. 

Other games I tried on EggNS: 

- Astral Chain 30 fps, it's pretty good but haven't gotten to intense combat yet

- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe starts at 60 fps but it drops to 40 fps

- Super Mario Bros U Deluxe 60 fps whole time

- Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Violet had issues maybe it needs a driver update cause others can run it

- Metroid Prime Remastered 60 fps

My personal experiences (and no, I don't take pictures of all stats before and after I make settings changes to my devices) with previous models have shown improvements in performance and battery by both being able to turn it off if it's an option (added in One UI 5.0) or tuning it down to lower GB amounts. Because of those previous experiences it was something I turned off first getting my new devices and friends of mine have had similar improvements especially in battery after I recommended they turn it off.

I understand a lot of this is anecdotal and you can discount it if you so feel inclined but I know my end user experience has been greatly improved by choosing to bypass this feature and I thought it was worth putting out there for others.",1677459637.0

You Know That 5Ghz Band Wifi6 issue most S22/S23 Ultras has been having? I may have found a good Temporary Solution for this.,0,11cqe66,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11cqe66/you_know_that_5ghz_band_wifi6_issue_most_s22s23/,12,"So I've been dealing with this for over a year now, trying everything under the sun to get this to work and I noticed that the majority of the time the issue happens with Asus Routers. And ironically I have one too, an RT-AX86U to be exact. 

So after a lot of research & trial and error, I found myself a good Temporary Solution that has been working for over a week now, with the WiFi signal lagging very briefly on a rare occasion, with maybe one time where I thought the issue came back but the whole internet was down instead 😅.

So here's what I did:

1. No Smart Switch was used to set up my S23 Ultra. Never liked it to be honest. I use Samsung Cloud and Google Drive via Google One to back up everything & I keep all my stuff in the cloud so it was only a re-download of what was needed. And I only brought back only my Messages & Call Log, cuz I'm forgetful 😅. I also manually added my WiFi to my phone, I didn't bring it over. I also cleared it from my Known WiFi Networks as well beforehand.

2. I switched the Router's software from ASUSMerlin back to Stock ASUS software, and updated it to the most STABLE version. Get it from ASUS directly & install it via the web gui.

3. I did both the HARD Factory Reset AND the NORMAL Factory Reset after I updated the router. There's two versions of it apparently. I did the version where you are physically pressing buttons to do it, and then I did the normal one on the Web Gui. Look up Hard Factory Reset *insert router name here* and it'll give you the way to do it for that particular version.

4. Went through Initial Router Set-up normally. Kept the same name & password, **stick to WPA2 security, you'll see why in a second**

5. *on the phone* Turned on Developer Settings on the phone, turned on Wifi Safe Mode.

6. Settings, Connections, WiFi, tap on the 3 Dots on the top right and choose Intelligent WiFi & turn off Prioritize Real-time Data.

7. *in Web Gui for the Router* Turn off 802.11ax/WiFi 6 mode. It's in Wireless. Make sure you do it for both bands (the first section will be which band you're editing, choose accordingly)

8. I actually kept on the 160 Mhz option for the 5Ghz because I want my speed dammit. Hasn't affected anything.

9. Switched my DNS (including IPv6) out of Cloudflare to a different DNS, I used Google. IPv4 is in the WAN section, IPv6 is in the IPv6 section (switch only if you actually have that one normally) **I didn't try different DNS options, Google was always my second choice, my focus was NOT using Cloudflare. Try different ones and see, I was always having issues with Cloudflare**

10. **for fun cuz why not** Restart everything. Phone, Router, and Modem if you're feeling fancy. Why? It doesn't hurt so might as well.



That's it. No Phone Mac. No Static IP on the phone. I'm on my 5Ghz Band consistently and it works almost flawlessly. Granted I would love to have Wifi6 available to me so I can get a better router with the 6Ghz Band as an option, but being able to use my 5Ghz in a stable way on my phone when I need that is more important to me. So there we go.",1677440176.0

S23 Ultra Best Camera Setups - Issue with Indoor High Contrast Scenes Though,0,11c2te5,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11c2te5/s23_ultra_best_camera_setups_issue_with_indoor/,0,"Been comparing shots on the Samsung S23 Ultra I just got to my Note 20 Ultra.  As expected, it's not a night and day difference of course.  But in most scenes, the S23 Ultra produces moderately better results with the biggest difference when using Expert Raw in 50MP mode both JPG and RAW output (while the latter is going to be better for post editing.  I imagine 200MP is good too but I'm passing on that large of file size).

I found what I think though is a limitation in the camera software (or sensor).  Hopefully Samsung will fix it in a future update. It is for moderately low light indoor photos (like late afternoon and overcast with no indoor lighting turned on), but where you have a bright scene through the windows (like snowy mountains).  I imagine this happens in any room where you have bright window scene and not a bright room. 

The normal camera on the Note20 Ultra does much better metering and doesn't blow out the scene in the windows.  The S23 Ultra comes very close if using the normal camera in 12MP mode but at best it's equal to the Note in other tests the S23 Ultra totally blew out the window scene where the Note 20 Ultra didn't.  In this test scene it got a little worse in 50MP mode.  Then it gets even worse in Pro mode.  In Expert Raw it is bad too in some circumstances no matter what metering mode you select or exposure setting.  If you are lucky to get a decent shot in Expert Raw you can tweak the RAW output in Adobe lightroom, but it's still not as good as the normal camera mode on both phones! Where as most other shot scenes, the Expert Raw in 50mp mode is superior to the other modes and anything the Note 20 Ultra puts out, but you need to zoom in on the photo to really notice the difference.  (Safe to say if you're a Note 20 Ultra User (or S21/22 Ultra), you're not missing out much as the 200mp sensor in the S23 Ultra is as I expected part modest improvement and part a lot of marketing hype.)

Here's a comparison between normal 12mp camera output on Note 20 and S23 Ultra, then an Adobe Lightroom edited RAW image coming from Expert Raw on the S23 Ultra in 12mp mode.  

So the end conclusion is that in the current state of the software, on the S23 Ultra, for high contrast moderate natural light indoor shots like this, you are best just using the standard 12mp auto mode in the regular camera app. Whereas in most other situations you get the best quality with reasonable file size shooting in Expert Raw at 50mp.

Cancelling order (+Cancelling Trade-In),0,11bsfkb,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11bsfkb/cancelling_order_cancelling_tradein/,7,"So in my other post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11b0fks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11b0fks/)) I was debating keeping the S23 Ultra due to the size.

I decided not to keep it since i just can't get happy with it and have to trust my gut feeling here.

When i purchased, I paid just over £800 including a bunch of discounts and a trade in discount of £290 for my existing phone. (Which i have not yet sent to them)

I spoke to Samsung about returning the S23 Ultra , and they said they would refund me the £800 when i return the phone, and since i would not be sending my S20 to them, would be charged £290 from the trade in team.

I can't get my head around how this would make sense, because in my mind , The £290 discount would only be applicable if i kept the device , but since i'm cancelling altogether, Can't see how that is logical?

Am i getting this wrong?

TLDR : Paid £800 , Got the S23 Ultra , Would have cost me £290 more without a trade in, Didn't send the trade in, Cancelling order, Should be getting £800 back and calling it a day?",1677350956.0

Avoid Pixel phones,17,11bhlok,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11bhlok/avoid_pixel_phones/,58,"I've had my pixel 7 for under a month, and I've had to contact customer support on a few things, firstly my 3 months free YouTube premium to which they stated if you have already used any free trial then you cannot use this. I told them I have used a free trial but there's an option for another free month to which I have activated and sent the screenshot stating that isn't the issue. They told me well we can't do anything about it. 

My next issue was the trade in services and how my phone got rejected for screen burns, I sent them the pictures clearly showing there are no burns. They said they have escalated it to the highest tier and their response was because it has been returned we can't do much but here you go a free 40£ gift card. If this is there responses a month into my new phone what will it be when my phone experiences any hardware or software issues.

I've had to download a couple of apps because Samsung had irmt stock Google didn't for example Samsung pass, background media player, music player, that's actually good and customisable, Samsung notes, if your screen is off you can't hold to reduce the volume you have to tap it to reduce it or turn the screen on to hold it - I use this alot when I'm sleeping so it's a daily issue but exclusive to me. Not sure why WiFi and data are not separate options and sometimes weirdly turns on WiFi and connects me even though I've had it off, I had to install a new app that allows me to add documents or pictures as a shortcut on the home screen

As for what's good from the pixel: it's smoooth, above average battery life, I like the ss features, when the picture is good it's amazing, DND works amazing - miles ahead of Samsung, others I can't think of as of right now. 

All in all its a great phone but compared to Samsung I definitely have missed a lot of features and the customer service with Samsung is top notch compared to Google and this is why I am making the move, ofcourse backed with the downsides that I have with the phone.",1677319912.0

Time to celebrate guys as an android user.

It's sad that Samsung's Exynos processor failed so bad. Especially since my S10, when it was an amazing and powerful SoC.

But Samsung burnt European users with that chip (incapable to keep up with the competition, including system lags) it is questionable whether they will gain back their trust and mine.

I feel Samsung should acquire Qualcomm and let their own failed attempt of making an own chip go.

Rest of the world (RoW) doesn't have any idea what we had to deal with (as Europeans (for the past 3 years, we had been the guinea pig with their Exynos attempt and it failed lately.

Samsung generally should learn from it and make one chip for their phone anywhere else in the world and make a firm decision on what to do (Apple's own SoC as an example) and not create two classes of users on the same phone.

Now I couldn't care less with my S23 but boy oh boy did Samsung burn me with their European S22,  I will not forget this Samsung.",1677300907.0

I know this might sound like a rant, but I hope it doesn’t.  I would just like to provide my personal experience of why I no longer trust Samsung Mobile and then ask for your thoughts.

  

  \-	[Samsung Note 7 Recall](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-galaxy-note-7-return-exchange-faq)

2 (iirc?) recalls.  1 attempt to fix it then 1 to refund. This is a bad sign of poor internal processes.

  

\-	[Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Bricked](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-software-update-vi3-bricking-smartwatches/) 

Both my wife’s watch and mine bricked by a bad firmware update.  Out of warranty and Samsung Philippines initially refused to repair it even though Samsung firmware bricked it!  Had to raise this higher up the food chain to resolve but took weeks.

  

\-	Samsung Fold Screen Reliability

My Fold 3 main screen failed at 18 months old.  Anecdotal evidence from friends on social media seemed to suggest this is common, usually somewhere between 18 months to 24 months.  Some of my friends with Samsung folding screen devices have even had 2 different models and they have had both different models fail in this timeframe.  As it’s outside of warranty Samsung want at least $700 to repair it presumably so it can fail again at some point in the future?

   

This has now left me with 6 Samsung tags that appear to be useless as I’m not likely buying another Samsung phone.

  

Would be interesting to hear in the comments from people who have had any Samsung folding phone for a long period (at least 18 months?) to see how they feel about their reliability.

  

\-	[Samsung S23 Screen Wrinkle](https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-screen-wrinkle) 

(I’ve not suffered this, included as evidence of continued failure)

Although this is still new and no one really knows for sure how many are affected, it’s clearly a defect and the excuse from Samsung is on par with Apples “your holding it wrong”.  This is not a cheap phone and neither is the waterproofing/dustproofing process so, why has it only appear on these new models?  Manufacturing or design defect?  It doesn’t matter how minor it is, it’s still a defect and under UK law (at least when I was at school) a product had to be “free from minor defect” or could be returned.

  

Samsung have cost me well over $2000 in wasted money (lest we not also forget time!) and peripherals I no longer have a use for.  Given this I don’t think I can trust Samsung anymore as either their design, manufacture or QA (or combination) just seem to be failing and these are the issues I’m aware of, I’m guessing there might be more. 

  

How many of you feel like you can still trust Samsung Mobile?

For me and from many reports, this happens on all WiFi 6 networks, at home and at work and outside at the mall. It is not an issue with some particular configuration or router. It is an issue with the S23 Ultra WiFi software/driver and how it handles WiFi 6 networks. It does not seem happen on WiFi 5 or WiFi 6E from the reports and my experience, so switching to either will resolve the issue until Samsung fixes it.

S22 was the worst decision ever,0,11atpz3,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11atpz3/s22_was_the_worst_decision_ever/,73,"I got the S22 for my birthday in december 2022 and I feel like I made my parents waste 700€. My previous phone (2019-2022) was S10e and before that an S4 so, although I like iPhone better, I'm more comfortable with Samsung but this phone (S22) doesn't feel like an upgrade in any way. Here are the 2 main things I suffer the most with this phone:

1. Selfie camera is disgusting. In social media apps (Whatsapp, bereal, ig...) if there's low light, the pic will turn out grey, it doesn't capture any color and my face has patches of my skin tone color in a grey background. Quality is awful. 

2. Charging takes forever. I don't know why but  I cannot use my phone while charging because it doesn't charge at all, it just maintains the same % or charges 1%/5min. Literally today I was doing breakfast while watching YT in the background, my phone started at 24% and in the course of exactly an hour, it only charged up to 31%. That's 7% in 60 minutes = 1% every 8 minutes. And I use the cable that comes with the phone.

Overall experience: As a regular person, not an expert, not a computer fan etc... This phone hasn't given me any new things, or improved in almost any way what I had in the S10e. I feel like the only thing I've noticed is the smoothness of a brand new phone vs a 3year old phone with tons of pics, apps in there which isn't really a point for the S22 because that's the purpose of buying a new phone. But even with barely 3 months of use, it still has its moments of running slow and bugging itself. 

As I said in the begging of the post, I feel like I (my parents) wasted 700€ and that I'm going to be stuck with this crap the next 3-5 years. If anyone out here has had the same experience as me, please share it so that way I know that I'm not alone or crazy. And if your experience with the S22 has been the complete opposite of this, share it too and hopefully give me tips on how I can get 100% of S22.",1677251680.0

How to Enable Cast Support in Media Output Switcher (One UI 5.1),1,11aqifo,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11aqifo/how_to_enable_cast_support_in_media_output/,1,"The One UI 5.1 changelogs specifically called out ""**Media output for Wi-Fi speakers**"" feature stating: *""If you want to continue listening to music on Wi-Fi speakers via Spotify Connect and built-in Chromecast, just open Media Output from the Quick Access Toolbar, not from the Music app""*

But after getting the Galaxy S23+ running One UI 5.1 I was disappointed when I first tried to switch playback from my phone to Google Home speakers using the 'Media Output' button in notification shade. It showed all my Google Cast devices, but it took several seconds to switch output to them and it didn't have any of the rich cast experience with album art and song information, just showed text 'Default Media Receiver' or something.

But tonight I accidently discovered a non-obvious setting page where you can change it from what appears to be Miracast mirroring, to actually use the Google Cast protocol. Apps need to be updated to support it, but it works great! Think it's only YouTube and YouTube Music at the moment.

**Instructions (screenshots here:** [**https://imgur.com/a/hG8QEMP**](https://imgur.com/a/hG8QEMP)**)**

1. Click on 'Media Output' in notification shade
2. Click the 'Gear' in top-right
3. Click on Wi-Fi speaker playback preference
4. Select 'Casting' to use Google Cast instead of the default 'Mirroring'

I have a powerful laptop but, for daily drive I use the tab, as it is ""smaller"". You know, Samsung recently came up with charging bypass for games, which I always wanted for my laptop, FOR YEARS!!. I always though, why the F not they don't just bypass charging. Let me have the option to use internal battery as UPS. If the electricity cut, use the battery, but don't charge it, until its under (I don't know) 30%. You would think, in this era, it would be a piece of cake for companies, but for some reason, they just don't do it.

And finally, FINALLY, a company did it. But just for gaming??? Dude, these phones and tablets have dex mode! Make the charge bypass for the entire OS. You can hide it under some deeper settings if you don't trust ""not-so-tech-savvy"" users messing up thier tablets and blaming it on you, but do it please. Hell, make it void warranty if you so wish to, but make it available to me. I beg of you. You would increase my interaction with the tablet and phone 10 folds.

"My experience with S23 Ultra, coming from Pixel 7 Pro",54,11almnl,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11almnl/my_experience_with_s23_ultra_coming_from_pixel_7/,51,"Let me start with the problems I had with my Pixel 7 Pro, which pushed me to get the S23 Ultra.

As someone who is constantly trying to capture videos of my cats all day long, P7 Pro was just not a great device. Don't get me wrong, if the lighting was good, videos were decent. But most of my indoor shots had a lot of noise. Evening and night time videos were average at best unless I had got some good lighting setup.

Another issue I had was overheating and battery life, if I was shooting 4k videos, the battery just didn't last as long. Editing videos on the phone wasn't that great either... Tensor's subpar performance really made editing slower and the device would just get hot quickly. I saw that warning multiple times where it would say that the device is too hot to continue shooting and it had barely been 5 mins of 4K 30fps recording.

I came from iPhone 13 Pro before P7 Pro so all of these issues with video recording and performance annoyed me a lot. I didn't want to go back to Apple ecosystem because let's just say that I got bored from iOS and wanted to experience Android again.

I preordered S23 Ultra on the launch day and have had the device for about a week now. I'm really happy with the performance and video quality so far. Although I'm not a professional videographer, I have tried shooting some 8K clips of my cats, and I really like the end result, and even uploaded it to YouTube. I've been able to record 4K 60 fps for longer than 10 mins, and have not really seen any overheating warnings so far. Phone has just gotten warm once when I downloaded like 40GB of data over 5G network in one go.

Video editing feels smoother and a better display with S Pen really helps here with precision. I'm mostly editing for reels/shorts, and I've been very happy with the results so far. Battery life is much better and I charge my device once every day.

Only thing I would say that I miss from Pixel 7 Pro is shutter speed. Samsung is not too bad but I definitely feel the difference and before anyone points out, I've already installed the camera assistant app and turned on the faster shutter setting. But that's just for shutter lag, not shutter speed.

If my cats are moving too much, I am mostly taking a video and not a picture, so the shutter speed factor doesn't bother me as much. S23 Ultra is just a better overall camera experience for me.

I don't do any gaming on my phone so I can't say much about in that area.

Overall, I'm a happy S23 Ultra user.

Did any of you come from Pixel 6/7 series devices? If yes, what were the key reasons to upgrade to S23 series and how has your experience been so far?",1677224147.0

Never had any stuttering problems. Never was sluggish. I didn't even manage to fill up the 256gb capacity within 2 years of use. 

But, after a couple of weeks contemplating, I decided to pull the trigger and get the S23 Ultra.

To be honest, there's not a massive difference between the two phones that hits you in the face. The jump didn't feel anywhere as massive as it did when I went from the S9 plus to the S21 Ultra. 

Except for one aspect. Battery life. I had just gotten close to 9 hours of SoT with Wifi and Bluetooth both on. 

I mostly browsed Reddit, an hour in a half of Youtube, about 2 hours of gaming and some social media browsing.

Well one week later, I have never been happier about making the switch. This has been my experience so far after a week.

Battery Life: I started out with a decent  SOT of around 5 hours. I have to say this is not really bad and as someone who works a lot and does not mind charging my phone once or twice a day, SOT is sufficient for me. But I decided to see if I could push it further. So I decided to optimize my phone and here's how I did it:

1) I never charge the phone when the phone is hot. This is very important even than turning on to protect the battery.

2) I also realized adaptive brightness was overestimating the brightness I needed. So I set up modes and routines for the times I get home and around the times I sleep. Around the time I get home, my At home mode sets the brightness to 4% which is more than enough for me. Around the time I sleep, I have a routine set to turn off the phone if I plug the charger in to keep the phone cool and it also turns to protect the battery on to keep the phone's battery from stress overnight.

3) I also make sure to close apps I am not using anymore so the ram doesn't try to keep it open + RAM uses a significant amount of battery.

After doing this SOT went from 5 hours to 9-11 hours depending on the use which involved watching Netflix(the screen is so good lol), using social media, reading, etc.

Camera: 

The camera out of the box was great but it somehow didn't process some pics properly imo. But somehow it's like it got better overnight. The pics coming out of the phone are crazy good now not even kidding. Some Portraits shots  I took the other day of my kid look like they were professionally photographed. I can't explain what I did to improve the camera so much but one thing I noticed is that the more lighting the better. Also being stable when taking a photo really helps. won't decide to go into shutter lag because that's a whole post of its own.

Other:

Apps run smoothly with like one lag because I have labs turned on (which they did mention could cause some lags), SPen has been amazing been using it more times than I can count, pop out the pen, write something on AOD, pin it, and never forget.

 Review after a week:  I still think this is the best phone out there. With all the features it provides. There are many other things that I could go on and on about the phone but that will make this post too long. Not saying it's perfect, I don't expect it to be and after one week it's one of the best purchases I have made in a while.

PS: One thing I really dislike about the phone is Samsung emojis. Pure shit. Thank God Android is highly customizable. I currently use iPhone emojis on my S23 Ultra. Please leave any more tips that can help me better optimize my phone. Thanks",1677183468.0

Can Samsung stop messing with Routines?,5,11a70g0,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11a70g0/can_samsung_stop_messing_with_routines/,6,"Anyone knows where I can post ""feedback"" for Samsung to read?

I have 1 single routine, which is ""Night Time"". Set to turn on at 12am-9am, which will trigger a bunch of stuff (DND, Night filter, etc.).

Previously on OneUI 4, when it was just ""Routines"", I was able to just use a quick toggle to disable all routines if I decide that I don't want my ""night time"" routine to be running at say 2am, then toggle it again to turn it on when I want it back on.

Then with OneUI 5, they made it ""Modes & Routines"", and the quick toggle stopped working. So I had to go into the Modes & Routines app to disable/enable the routine whenever I want to.

Now with OneUI 5.1, they once again messed with it. If I disable the routine when it's running, I can't re-enable it for some reason.

This is so frustrating, it was working fine in OneUI 4, why did they add modes and screwed everything up.",1677182148.0

Repurposing my S10 - Ideas and Suggestions?,10,11a35cs,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11a35cs/repurposing_my_s10_ideas_and_suggestions/,29,"Hi all,

Recently, I made the switch from my trusty Samsung Galaxy S10 to the newer, more advanced S23 Ultra. While I love my new device, I couldn't help but notice that my S10 is still in great condition and fully functional, except for its battery life. So, I've been thinking about ways to repurpose it and make the most out of it.

I'm curious to hear how other people have repurposed their older smartphones. Have you found any creative uses for your old devices? Maybe you've integrated them into a work desk setup or found a way to use them as a security camera or music player.

Personally, I'm considering using my S10 as a dedicated music player or a bedside clock with an alarm feature. I've also heard of people using their old devices as a home security camera, a remote control for their smart home devices, or even as a backup phone in case of emergency.

If anyone has any other suggestions or ideas, I would love to hear them. It would be great to repurpose my S10 in a way that adds value to my daily routine and reduces e-waste.

Thanks in advance for your input!",1677172805.0

Samsung Customer Service,5,11a2gw6,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11a2gw6/samsung_customer_service/,7,"Just wanted to put this out there. I'm in a bunch of different subreddits related to Samsung and their products. I am constantly seeing people say something to the effect of ""Great products but the worst customer service of any company"". 

I've been using their products almost exclusively for the last 10 years and am not the easiest customer in terms of expectations. Meaning I'll send my phone in for a repair/service more than a few times over the course of that time. I have never had a bad experience with them. My issues always get solved with minimal headache. And I would even say dealing with them is almost always a pleasant experience. There was only one occasion where I was almost let down. Last year, after 4 or 5 months of ownership, I sent in my Z fold 3 to get the main display replaced as it had started to develop little cracks down the center of the crease. But the main display did have accidental damage on it that i caused within the first week of ownership. (a few dead pixels) But the two were not related. After I sent in the phone, they basically said it wouldn't be covered under warranty and they would need $500 to replace the display.  I called Samsung after seeing that email and complained about how the two issues are unrelated and the agent said that she would try to see if she can get that point across and get the screen replaced under warranty. I wasn't expecting much after we got off the phone since i had been hearing so many people complain about their customer service. Anyway, I got an email a few hours later stating that the repair was made under warranty and the phone was being overnighted to me.

Since this post is much longer than I had anticipated, I won't explain the pleasant experience I had with them over the past few days. Just Know that as somebody who deals with Samsung customer service at least once a year, I have never been let down. And I would even say that of all the companies i have dealt with, Samsung, IN MY EXPERIENCE, has had by far the best customer service.",1677171197.0

Suspecting it had something with the WiFi 6 protocol, I swapped back to my old WiFi 5 router. The phone has since maintained the connection for more than 24 hours, where before it would drop the WiFi 6 connection within an hour or two.

I also filed a claim with FedEx and am waiting for an answer.

**s20+**  
I just love the feeling. Mine has a case because I don't want to break if if I drop it, but without the case it's the most comfortable phone I ever had. Size is perfect, rounded edges are very comfy to hold. If it had dynamic refresh and better camera, it would be perfect.

**iPhone 13 Pro Max**  
I have this because of work. I hardly use it because the flat edges/sides are so uncomfortable to hold in my hands. Plus it's extremely big and heavy. Maybe I'm biased because I don't like Apple products, but I would very much prefer a smaller iPhone, can't really understand why someone would want the bigger version of the phones besides to have the best.

**s23+**  
I so much wanted to like it. I don't care about the S-Pen at all, so my first thought was getting the s23+, although I would love to have the same screen (1-120hz) and cameras as the Ultra. But the flat edges... feels exactly like the iPhone 13 Pro Max... too uncomfortable to hold! And the fact that it feels mid-flagship due to the features... I don't know. IMO the plus and U should each share more similarities in terms of hardware, except the shape and S-Pen.

**s23U**  
I was surprised, it is as big as my S20+ without a case. It means phones are not getting bigger, but a bit smaller. I'm not a fan of the squared shape, but the edges are soft/rounded like the s20+ which makes it comfy to hold in your hands. And because it's not actually bigger, for my hands it's perfect. I just dislike that it has the S-Pen (could live without it), and the overall squared shape is not my cup of tea.

I'm not sure which one to buy. I'm really torn between the plus and ultra. So much that I'm considering skipping this generation completely. My s20+ (march 2020) still feels good as new. I like to change my phone every 2-3 years but can't find enough reasons yet.

So rn in Europe they have a sale going on where you can get the 1TB variant for the price of a 512GB variant, this would mean it would cost €1579, the guy who helped me then asked if I had a phone I could trade in and I told him I just sold my iPhone but I had an old LG G6 with broken screen with me as my backup. He said he could take it in and provide another €200 discount if I did that (for a phone that's worth absolutely nothing). Then he asked me if I were a student (I am) which was another €157 discount.

S23 Light-Mode Experiences,127,119ishd,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/119ishd/s23_lightmode_experiences/,98,"Going to keep it brief as I can. Testing Light Mode on the base S23 which claims ~30-40% power/heat savings for ~10% performance off the top on the S23.

**Performance:** I cannot force a scenario where I notice the 10% performance hit. I've even tested it with Skyline Emulator (something that pushes the SOC to the max, yet Samsung does not detect as a game so light mode appears to be intact).

**Battery:** A definite boost but its within a range that might seem placebo but seems a bit too good to be just that. ~5-10% increase which on the S23 which already had solid battery life is actually a good bit of time. I think the impact to battery life with DeX usage and while multitasking in general was pretty noticeable 

**Heat:** Biggest benefit by miles. Android Auto with GPS (wired and wireless) ends up ice-cold, DeX and multitasking (was already not so bad) doesn't even warm it up, really it's only tasks that kick the GPU on that will heat up the phone anymore.

**Conclusion / my 2-cents:** If you can't specify a need for the max clockspeeds (excluding gaming when light mode disables itself) then you should absolutely be using light mode, or at the very least try it out for a few days. Outside of Geekbench I absolutely never used/felt the top 10% of this SD8G2(fg).. but I definitely feel these efficiency benefits.",1677111474.0

SmartThings/Location+Wifi scanning/Modes and Routines,0,119gfgx,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/119gfgx/smartthingslocationwifi_scanningmodes_and_routines/,7,"So i'm moving into the new age and i guess i'm questioning how things work when i switch to automations for home appliances/networking etc.

Generally on my phone, i don't have bluetooth, wifi, or location enabled since they drain battery quite effectively. Usually i'm rocking the mobile data *exclusively* since i'm on unlimited.Only turn on location when using maps, and bluetooth works by itself when i use my earbuds.

What i want to do is have my phone switch networks when i'm in/out the house (using connect/disconnect from network as trigger) and turn off/reverse location and mobile data toggles. This i already have configured.

BUT here is the big question. In order to have this work autonomously, i'll probably need to have GPS, Bluetooth, WIFI and mobile data all turned on when i'm outside... Right?

I've noticed there are settings for certain apps pertaining location scanning (high and low precision) and also wifi/bluetooth scanning even if they're both turned Off.

...How does this all mesh together? Do i need to run BT/WIFI/GPS all day?   
Because that's probably a deal-breaker.   
But if there's some automation i can write, or if low-usage background processes are adequate to determine my location for using smart home 'things', i'd love to know.

Finally Europe gets snapdragon. Pre order S23. Physically, the device is amazing. Great display, great speakers, great size, can remove almost all the bloatware. 
But the camera…is terrible.

***12 mp photos*** - great in good lighting. Grainy and blurry as shit indoors.

***50 mp photos*** - WTF. Takes 5 seconds to process and turns up hdr and saturation to a 100 with scene recognition off. This can be resolved by installing the camera assistant and setting the shutter speed to prioritise speed over quality and turning on the scene recognition. When you prioritise speed, it doesn’t apply the post processing. But the hit to quality is noticeable.

***Shutter lag*** - I didn’t think this would be an issue. But it is. Tried to sort this out via the camera assistant, but still blurry photos of my kid. I did a side by side comparison by taking photos from both, the s23 and my iPhone and the iPhone took 12 photos while the s23 took 6.
The lag is unbearable. 

My wife tried to take some photos from the car and they were all blurry and the focus was all over the place. 
Never happens with the iPhone. 

**ExpertRAW** - 

***50 mp***- Horrible over processed , green tinted photos. Akin to non raw 50 mp ones. It’s supposed to be raw ? With little to no processing. It’s especially horrible at night. Raises all shadows, saturation and HDR 100%

https://youtu.be/mVrO53ABpPk

***12 mp*** - fine again. 

Tried toggling auto hdr in settings. Didn’t help. 

***Video*** - 

Always starts off choppy, but smoothes out eventually. 
Also notice the lights in the videos taken at night to be flickering a lot. 

All this over processing also means I never know how a photo is going to turn out. I’m looking at something and expect to take a photo of what I see. 10 seconds later, you have a photo that is over processed to shit with it looking nothing like what I see. 

Maybe I got a dud. 

I have raised a return and will be keeping my iPhone. 
Saw a bunch of reviews praising the cameras but am left disappointed. 
Would get a pixel if Google started selling them officially in my country.
I guess I’m stuck with Apple till then.

Is the battery life on the s22 ultra exynos really that bad or even worse than the s21 ultra? This is my main reason for opting more for the s21 ultra instead of the s22 ultra.

I've read lots of opinions and experiences but I wanted to ask the question myself.

I'm looking to hold onto this phone for a year or so until the next IPhone / S24 ultra is released and then decide on one of the best phones.

For now I just want to get rid of this huawei since its barely working anymore.",1677081486.0

Samsung Shop (India) Really messed up my order!,3,118vstc,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/118vstc/samsung_shop_india_really_messed_up_my_order/,7,"So I pre-ordered the S23 Ultra along with the grip case, Watch 5 pro, Buds 2 pro and Screen protector on 5th. The watch 5 pro had a delivery date of 7th Feb. I scheduled the buds 2 pro to deliver on 16th Feb. Other items being a pre-order, it was expected to start shipping from 17th Feb. Weird thing about the case and the screen protector was that it's shipping was to start from 17th but delivery date was for 16th!!

So here's the day by day timeline so far on what followed.
7th Feb - As expected the Watch 5 pro got delivered. I didn't have an android at the time to set it up since I was still in the iPhone.

16th Feb - My buds 2 pro was supposed to be shipped by now and it was still showing confirmed on the app. Whole day passed and they were not delivered.

17th Feb - My S23 Ultra got shipped with a delivery date for 18th. But the grip case and screen protector were still not packed. Same case with the buds as well. I called up Samsung to enquire and they assured it will be delivered on 18th.

18th Feb - Got my phone and I was super excited. The whole day went in setting up the phone. During the later half I checked the app for status on the remaining 3 items and they were still not packed. I called up Samsung again and now they were telling they will register a Complaint. I told the guy why was a wrong commitment given and they had no answer. They told me it would be sorted it 24hrs. Since I didn't have a case, I ordered a ringke case from Amazon
 
19th Feb - Same status of order not packed. I got my Ringke case though.
 
20th Feb - I called up Samsung again and they telling their teams weren't working on Sunday so nobody was able to look at the issue.

21st Feb - Samsung finally started packing the order but split them into 3 different shipments.

22nd Feb - Recieved the Grip Case and Screen Protector. Yet to receive the Buds since it's delivery date is 23rd.

I think Samsung forgot to place the order till I escalated to their support since I got no communication from them even if there was a delay. Samsung didn't even have the courtesy to do that. The invoice dates found in my screen protector and case box are dated on 21st Feb which means i dont think they have accounted for the pre-orders properly. Overall a super disappointing first experience with Samsung Shop.",1677065285.0

A52 5G to S23 Base?,9,118uzs0,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/118uzs0/a52_5g_to_s23_base/,16,"Hello everyone, I can clearly see the hardware difference between my current mid range device and the base S23 model but I'm really curious about the difference in experience. 

Sure I have shitty haptics, unusable night photography, video and no good zoom and a few software hiccups here and there. 

Even compared to a S22U my friend has though, I wouldn't say the experience was of a different world. Night photography even though way better, it was still a smartphone photo and unusable other than to send to a friend. Same with the display,  it's just a bit better than mine. Performance difference I couldn't really tell other than the phone being a bit snappier. I suppose the S23 base model won't be that much better than the S22U. 

Am I missing some aspect of the flagship experience?
I use my phone only for social, YouTube and emails/browsing. And my latest flagship was the Nexus 5 which I loved.

Samsung's stupidest decision,0,118sgiq,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/118sgiq/samsungs_stupidest_decision/,45,"I got my S20 last year and have to say it's been a wonderful phone. Very Sleek, the camera works great and the phone is very powerful. Have to say it's probably the best phone I've owned so far.

I was looking into some newer models though just window shopping to see any interesting features the newer phones have. Until I found out Samsung removed one of it's core features.

The micro SD slot. No phone past the 20 had a micro SD slot. Like wtf? Why? The micro SD slot is one of Samsung's most useful features. I never cared what size phone I got because I always have a 128gb micro SD card that I've been using since my S7. 

I just think it's such a stupid thing to remove. Out of all things to take out they take out the microsd slot? I don't want to use cloud based storage. 

It's been 3 generations and they haven't brought it back. So it's safe to say that the feature is gone for good. 

Ik I'm probably ranting and that this has been discussed before. But man I'm pissed, idek what phone I'd use once I'm done with the S20. I plan to use this for another 2-3 years at least. But after that idk.

I hadn't really seen anyone post any sort of comparisons around this setting yet.

If anything the blur looks a litter worse to me under prioritize speed, but I think that's just from the dog being a bit closer. Either way, it absolutely does not improve the issue significantly.

Why are T-Mobile employees so slimy?,0,118j0j0,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/118j0j0/why_are_tmobile_employees_so_slimy/,12,"I wanted to buy a Samsung Galaxy S23 through [samsung.com](https://samsung.com) using T-Mobile as a carrier. I saw that for the 256GB version, the price was $859.99, and with taxes it went to roughly $923. I was about to buy it until I was directed to a webpage were I was given the option to upgrade my line, or add a new line. I wanted neither but that was not an option, plus I did not remember my T-Mobile pin so I just exited and decided to go to buy it at a T-Mobile store.

I arrive at the store and the sale almost gets finalized until the inform me that, with taxes, the price is $962. I ask why the price is higher than the website's price and they tell me that the 256GB version is $100 more expensive, whereas in the website it's only $60 more expensive. I cancel the deal and I go to another store to see if I can get a price that matches the website's. The representative at the other T-Mobile location tells me that with taxes, the price is $923. They also tell me that they cover the shipping and $923 is the final figure, hence matching the webiste's price. I agree to the deal and 40 minutes later I see a charge on my credit card that is $962. I call customer support and they tell me that there is a $35 support fee that comes with upgrading my line, which is mandatory. I did not see it on the website because I never got past that webpage.

In hindsight, the first representative lied as well by making it seem that the extra charge was due to samsung, not T-Mobile. Ironically, his lies are what ruined the deal for him. The second representative was more shrewd in her craft and got me. I would have paid the support fee regardless, but price obfuscation gave me a bad taste in my mouth.

The first was released in 2022 and is able to charge the S23U from 0-100% in under an hour. The second was released in 2019 and is the charger that is barely better than the 25W charger.

I pre-ordered an S23+ on 2nd Feb. Still have no actual ETA as to when I'll get it.

What is the actual point of pre-ordering a device when you get it weeks AFTER it's general release?
The entire purpose of pre-ordering is so that you can put yourself in front of the front of the queue on release day.

What's more is they try to act like Online Exclusive colours take longer. How? Even IF they were specifically made to order, it wouldn't take 3-4 weeks to assemble and ship. Even IF they were customised with engraving and things like that on top of assembly to order, that still wouldn't take that long.
It's a COLOUR. literally a different casing around the same internals.

Customer service are good for nothing other than summarising ""terms & conditions"", they don't help at all.

Why provide the ability to pre-order when it's genuinely faster to drive to any 3rd party retailer and buy it on the release date.

To be clear: I'm in Australia, I ordered the Graphite colour, and I paid outright.

So they have $1700+ and literally cannot provide me with an indication as to when I'll receive the goods in exchange for the money they've had in their account for WEEKS.

Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 Review - An Apple User's Perspective,36,117nr45,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/117nr45/galaxy_book3_pro_360_review_an_apple_users/,25,"I've had the Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 For almost 3 weeks now, and I wanted to share my thoughts and answer your questions. 

As a point of comparison, my personal laptop is a 2021 14"" MacBook Pro. I'm also very deep in the Apple bubble and was interested in how Samsung's matching some of their integrations with its own ecosystem. 

Disclaimers:

* This is a review unit loaned to me by Samsung, but all thoughts are completely my own and haven't been run by anyone before posting.
* This is an engineering sample, so some of my comments may be fixed in final retail units. 
_________

# Summary - 8/10

- Build quality, Display and Keyboard are fantastic. 
- Trackpad is massive, but some weird tracking inconsistencies let it down.
- SPen is great if that's something you need. 
- Battery is good. Not outstanding, but good enough. 
- Ecosystem is the best it's been, but a little inconsistent at times.
- Speakers, webcam, fingerprint scanner are ok, but could definitely use some improvement. 

_________

# Build Quality - 9.5/10

* This thing is very solidly built. There's very little chassis flex or creaking. Nothing feels like it's going to fall off or break. 
* Only real gripe is with the screen. There's a little bit of flex because of how slim it is. It's not enough to bend while you're trying to open the laptop or anything, but it is enough that you can click the trackpad through the screen if you grip it hard enough in just the right spot. But again, I don't have a final retail unit, so take my experience with a grain of salt. 

# Display - 9/10

* To my eye it looks significantly brighter than my MBP's screen.
* Saturation feels like it's cranked up a little. I like it, but I don't know enough about color accuracy to make a judgement there. There are other color profiles you can choose in settings if that's more your preference. 
* Black are deep thanks to OLED, and it doesn't suffer from [light bloom](https://imgur.com/a/pEIigdQ) like my MBP does. The camera does exaggerate the effect a little, but it's still very noticeable in person. 
* 16:10 is a very welcome change. It does mean you have letterboxing, but the tradeoff for everyday use is worth it IMO. 
* I'm not too fond of the rounded corners. It cuts into the UI a little, and while it's typically in title bars and the taskbar, it feels out of place. 
* There's a massive chin below the screen that makes it look cheap.
* The hinge is wobbly. Unsure if this is just something with my unit, but it's something that really annoyed me while trying to use the laptop. 

# SPen - 10/10

* There's practically zero latency when using the SPen. 
* There's a good amount of friction when writing. It's not quite pen on paper, but it's far from the plastic on glass feeling that a lot of styluses fall into.
* The SPen itself feels a little hollow. Doesn't impact functionality at all, it just feels a little cheap in the hand. 
* This is very nitpicky, but the button on the side of the SPen is on the rounded edge and I'd rather it were on the flat edge. 
* It mounts to some magnets on the back of the screen. It's ok if you're just looking for a place to keep it without it rolling away, but it's not staying on there in your bag. 

# Keyboard - 10/10

* I **LOVE** this keyboard. I recognize that I'm in the minority, but this reminds me a lot of Apple's butterfly keyboard which was by far my favorite keyboard of all time as far as typing experience goes (durability is a whole other topic). 
* They keys are definitely on the shallower side of the spectrum. I don't have a way of accurately measuring it, but if I had to guess it's around 1 mm of travel. 
* Despite the low travel, it maintains a fair bit of tactility. I never found myself guessing if I'd actually pressed a key or not. 
* The keys are a nice size with enough separation between them to not be an issue. 
* It has a numpad if you're into that, but it's [not a standard layout](https://i.imgur.com/coaFfse.jpg). I found it a little frustrating to use because I kept missing the 0 and Enter keys, but I'm sure you'd get used to it. 
* The keyboard deck is solid, I haven't noticed any flexing. The keys are also very stable, no noticeable wobbling. 

# Touchpad - 6/10

* It's massive. There's no other way to put it. [Here it is compared to an S23 Ultra](https://i.imgur.io/SfpM9Z4_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium). If youre' into large trackpads, this thing is fantastic. 
* The size does take a little bit of getting used to when you're typing. It does have decent palm rejection, but it's not perfect. There is a shortcut on the function row to disable the touchpad, which might be useful during longer typing sessions.
* Good surface texture. 
* I had a weird issue where the first ~1 cm of any movement would be ignored. Not sure if this is part of the palm rejection algorithm, but it's **very** annoying. I hope this can get fixed in a software update, it's easily the worst part of using this laptop. 
* Windows gestures are still not as fluid as macOS gestures. They're miles better than they were a few years ago, but it still feels like they're one step behind. 
* I wish this was a haptic trackpad. Because of its size, the force you need to use to click varies wildly based on where you click. I may be spoiled by my MBP's trackpad, but being able to click anywhere with the same amount of force and feedback is very underrated. 

# Speakers - 7/10

* They're loud enough and produce a clean sound, but they're not going to win any awards. I've definitely heard worse speakers out there, but I've also heard better. 
* There's next to no bass. 

# Battery - 7/10

* It's enough to barely get through a workday with light use, but anything beyond that and you'll likely need to top up halfway through.
* As I'm typing this, I'm sitting at 68% with 4h 41m remaining. I've lost about 20% over the past hour and a half. 
* As a note, I did have my brightness cranked way up during my use; I'm sure being more conscious of your brightness would make the battery last significantly longer. 

# Performance and Heat - ?/10

* I haven't really had a chance to push this thing to its limits; my heavy workloads are enough to require dedicated workstations/clusters, which only leaves lighter everyday tasks for both this and my personal laptop. 
* I never felt this thing struggle, but that's not surprising with a light workload and a 13th gen i7-P. 
* This isn't a gaming machine, but a quick test in Minecraft gave me roughly similar framerates as my M1 Pro's GPU (~100-130 FPS, default settings). Rocket League on default settings was hovering around 40 FPS. Lighter titles should be playable, especially if you're willing to lower framerates, but this isn't the machine for you if you want to do any real gaming.   
* I may be spoiled by my MBP, but the Book3 gets noticeably warmer and the fans kick on more frequently than my MBP. It's not to the point where it's interfering with anything, but it's something I noticed. During the few minutes I was testing framerates with Minecraft, the Book3 was blasting its fan from the moment the game loaded and the MBP didn't even have time to get warm. 
  * That being said, being able to just install anything without worrying about ARM compatibility is freeing. Windows has their translation layer, as does macOS, but I try to avoid relying on it because a) there's a (small) hit to performance and battery and b) I don't expect the translation layers to stick around forever. 

# Ecosystem - 8/10

* Overall, I like what Samsung's trying to do here. If I could move away from macOS I'd be taking a hard look at Samsung's ecosystem as a replacement. 
* They have alternatives for a lot of the major integrations Apple has between their devices:
  * Quick Share vs AirDrop
  * Secondscreen vs Sidecar
  * Multi Control vs Universal Control
  * Phone Link (yes, I know this isn't Samsung specific) vs Continuity
* Some of these solutions are actually more functional. Quick Share lets you share via QR code or link so you can share with non-Samsung devices. Multi Control lets you control your phone, not just your tablet. Phone Link isn't limited to Samsung devices since it's a Google/Microsoft partnership. 
* My main gripe is that a lot of these alternatives have a little more friction than Apple's solutions. For example, with Multi Control you have to open the app to connect to your other devices, where with Universal Control you just move your cursor over to the edge and it'll connect automatically as you cross over the edge.

# Other

* **PORTS**. As much as I want to be live in a USB-C world, we're just not there yet, so **thank you**, Samsung, for keeping one USB-A around. I do wish they'd placed the USB-C ports on both sides so you could choose which side you use for charging, but I was told that's a limitation with the daughterboards they use for the ports. 
* The fingerprint scanner isn't the best. It works, but it's hit and miss in my experience. 
* The webcam is nothing to write home about.",1676934890.0

I will never go for Samsung if they again put exynos chipset in them,0,117levh,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/117levh/i_will_never_go_for_samsung_if_they_again_put/,32,"After 3 months with S22U and almost 1 week with S23+ I definetely will say that I won't ever get again samsung smartphone if they decide to put exynos in this device in Europe.

Seeking Advice on Switching from iPhone to Samsung Due to iMessage Issues,4,117aufr,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/117aufr/seeking_advice_on_switching_from_iphone_to/,26,"Hello everyone,

I'm hoping to get some advice on a problem I've been struggling with for a while now. I've been a lifelong iPhone user and I'm heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, especially in iMessage. However, I'm also a professional photographer and I've found that Samsung's Galaxy takes far superior photos, particularly indoors. As a result, I've been carrying around two phones for years, which has become a major inconvenience.

Recently, I decided to make a switch to Samsung Galaxy S23U and commit to it permanently. However, I've been facing a significant issue with iMessage. When I've tried to switch my SIM card from iPhone to Samsung in the past, Apple removed my information from their iMessage database, but people who had my information stored in their phone were not able to receive my messages. This has caused me a lot of frustration and has even affected my work, as I need to communicate with clients and colleagues regularly.

As a professional, text messages are essential for my livelihood and I need to be sure that my messages are delivered without any issues. While I've tried using a ""hack app"" called Beeper to get all my iMessages onto my Samsung, it's not a reliable method and it hinders the full functionality of texting and communicating. I've also tried swapping SIM cards before, but Apple does some shady things that prevent messages from being delivered properly.

I really want to make a permanent switch to Samsung, but the iMessage issue is making it difficult for me. While WhatsApp is an option, not everyone uses it and it's impossible to get some people to change. I'm hoping someone can offer some helpful information, past experience, or a solution to this problem.

Thank you for your help!

Edit: I am aware of the ""de-register iMessage number"" from Apple's website. Ive used that several times in the past, and, although it de-registers \*my\* number from iMessage, \*other\* people's phones still do not, at times, receive my texts and their phones ""think"" that an iMessage should be coming through.",1676908364.0

my current one is an s20, but the battery is done for, the screen is cracked, the camera slow... I need a change

looking at the price to quality ratio, I can't decide what's better; s23 or s22+

s23 does have a smaller battery, but the reviews state that the processor should make the performance better than an exynos chip would (I do not understand these things too much)

but the s22+ has a bigger battery. so

the rest doesn't matter much to me, as both are kinda similar, and good, so. I'd love a smaller phone, but rhe s22+ isn't much different from the base s20, so idk

They appear to be the only store selling it.

I've tried a few Magsafe cases so far including the Mous limitless 5.0 and the Pitaka, but the Zagg gear4 Denali Snap case feels the best to me.  It has all the qualities of a protective case without the bulk.  

The Pitaka case is very thin with almost zero shock absorption and limited protection on the sides and I was actually quite disappointed with the Mous case.  A lot of sharp edges and it didn't feel premium to me at all, but the magnet on both the Pitaka and Mous case are stronger than the Zagg.  Pitaka's magnet felt the strongest but I wouldn't say the magnet is necessarily weak on the Zagg, I would say it's pretty decent!  Works just fine on my magsafe car and desk chargers.

Just wanted to put this out there in case anyone was curious.  They also sell this in the Ultra variant on the Verizon store.

Based on what I see on the internet and this subreddit, battery life has been one of the strong points of this device. But somehow my device seems to be an outlier.  

My usage is pretty normal. Mix of wifi and mobile data. Some social media/reddit browsing, music listening via bluetooth and watching some YouTube  videos. With this usage I got only 4 hr 40 min of SOT before the battery hit 10%.  I have setup couple of routine one of which is switching off all connections and putting the phone to power saving mode while I sleep (1am -8am). Even with these measures in place, I see battery drain after wake up to be 6%. Without this routine setup overnight battery drain was 10%.  In just 40min after disconnecting from the charger and with light usage - mobile data, couple of calls, wallet transactions, couple camera clicks battery discharged from 99% to 90%.

 I do not see my device capable of even 6 hrs SOT, pretty far from all the 7-10 SOT user claims. Wondering if my device is an outlier.

Edit: I cleared the cache and was able to squeeze out 7 hrs SOT before the battery hit 5%. This is a good improvement. 
Still wondering how people are able to get 8 - 9 hrs SOT 🤔",1676869179.0
Got my Samsung S23 Ultra today. What are some of the first things to do on the phone?,15,116xbhm,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/116xbhm/got_my_samsung_s23_ultra_today_what_are_some_of/,65,"I upgraded from a google pixel 1 finally and got a s23 ultra today.

like probably everyone, i am excited for the new phone. However, 1 of the things i dislike the most about moving to a new phone is having to learn it... which most often means watching youtube, reading articles, etc.

So i was wondering, what are some of the things someone should do immediately once they first get their S23 ultra?

1 of the thing i just learned is that 1080p is set by default. But with its insanely great battery life, theres no reason to not leave it at 1440p.

2nd thing i learned is that the default settings for camera is set to a pretty high res rate, meaning even small meaningless photos (taking a picture of notes?) will result in a huge file size.",1676866338.0
is it better to charge to 80% or 100%?,134,116wjww,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/116wjww/is_it_better_to_charge_to_80_or_100/,146,"I've heard a lot of people say that only charging to about 80-85% will make your battery last longer, because the most damage occurs when charging between 80-100%

But if you only charge to 80% every day, you will only have 80% max every day. Sure, in 2-3 years your battery health will be better than if you were charging to 100% every day, but in a worst case scenario your battery (when charging to 100% every day) degrades to about 80% in 2-3 years. 

The way I see it, I can have 80% battery everyday or have 100% everyday while it slowly degrades over 2-3 years until it gets to 80% health.  Meaning that every time you charge to 100% you will actually be getting only 80% of it's original capacity. Which is the same as only charging to 80% when the battery is at 100% health.

So unless you upgrade every 3+ years I don't see a reason to not charge to 100% all the time.",1676863795.0

So as the title says, I've been suffering with the S22 for a year now, I got it at launch and while I love the size, the last straw was when I took my dad to the hospital and it died on me after barely any use at the end of the day. 

I've used Samsung phones for years, and this one is just ridiculously bad. 

Anyway. It's probably early but I'm already hearing great feedback about the S23, or rather how it should've been how the S22 is with the battery. That's good. 

I'm also open to considering the plus. The last plus I used was an S20+. I like the S23 size just like I like the S22 size but if the battery difference is quite huge I'm willing to jump. 

Also, just wondered, did they finally replace the Exynos chips for EU with snapdragon? 

Thanks.

"Samsungs ""shutter lag"" and blurry photo problem explained and how they could fix it",150,116oacz,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/116oacz/samsungs_shutter_lag_and_blurry_photo_problem/,73,"Everybody knows about Samsungs ""shutter lag"" issue, which to many seems like a complicated issue when IMO it really isn't.

First part of the problem is the actual shutter lag, which is the time between pressing the button and the phone taking the picture. Samsung included a feature that lets you hold the shutter button to record a video, which means that the phone will only take photos once you release the shutter button. I always believed that not giving an option to turn this off was a stupid idea and thankfully you can already fix this with Camera Assistant. They should consider disabling this by default or asking users on first startup. 

The second and more interesting part is the actual shutter speed of the photos. It seems that Pixel phones automatically adjust the shutter speed based on the amount of motion in the viewfinder, which any Pixel owner can test very easily. This is why Pixels still do good in camera comparisons where phones are held still, but it handles motion much better than Samsung phones because Samsung phones will still use a slow shutter speed while Pixels speed it up to reduce motion blur.

So that's it. Samsung literally built stuff like Document scanning and Bixby vision, but not just some algorithm to detect motion and correct shutter speeds.

**TL;DR: Adjust shutter speed based on viewfinder motion, like on the Pixel.**

edit: I've done some more testing and shutter lag is still a bit lower on a Pixel while also preserving HDR (Samsung sometimes loses HDR), which makes sense given the lengths to which Google went to reduce shutter lag. Still, the slow shutter speeds causing blurry photos can be fixed with the method I described, which is exactly what Google does on Pixels as well.

They should be able to fix this if they know what they're doing. I have no idea why they haven't already, maybe the issue is more complicated than what I described but it doesn't seem that way to me.",1676841595.0

With both priced around the same, I seek for your opinions on whether should I take the grand leap to apple/remain android.

Reasons I'm on the fence:
Not wanting to be stuck in the ecosystem and storage 
(similar price for 256gb Samsung S23 vs 128gb iphone 14).

Some say I should get a 128gb iphone and use my ipad as a second storage (I'm just using ipad to read/study hence the huge remaining storage). But the S23 camera/specs is overall better imo and with the pre-order deals, I can get an free upgrade on the storage as well.

Well the other day I went back and saw that google had turned only one premmision on and that was the microphone. This is without my concent and actually specifically against it.

It was during the time of the original fold. When they came with the plastic screen protector that people ripped off. Now samsung decided to go with a crappy recycled cardboard with crappy adhesive that when I opened the box, it was already off the screen, on my s23u. And it's only supposed to be used for protecting the phone inside the box vs actually being used cause it's cardboard.. 

Some may think it's a dumb thing to be upset about but when literally no store sells a plastic protector and only the 30$ liquid glass, or tempered glass protectors that I don't want to put on myself or even have... but that plastic film or whatever samsung put on the old phones could be used for years and then your screens protected from the micro scratches.",1676827936.0
Upgrade from s20+ broken back Germany,1,116i224,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/116i224/upgrade_from_s20_broken_back_germany/,3,"Hi folks,

I've a S20+ which I'm trading in to get s23u in Germany. My s20+ back glass is broken but everything else is flawless. 

I've read the terms and conditions for trade-in and only could find about them asking the phone to be in working condition with perfect display. 

However, I've read a lot of negative reviews about Teqcycle which manages trade-ins for Samsung in Germany. So, I'm not sure if I should replace my phone's back before sending it to them (need to figure out the details but should be cheaper than what they are paying for a S20+ with broken display)

Does anyone has any similar experience with Teqcycle and especially with broken back glass?

so far the only time my phone was hot was during initial setup when all the apps and settings were being transfered, as to battery life its way better than S22.

Right now I have 42% left and my SoT is **4h45m** and **16h** of standby. with these stats on S22 I would have around 15% left. (and even that had to be a very good day)

I do use 120Hz, GPS/Bluetooth on, Lightmode turned off, 99% Wifi only today though

My First Day of Testing My S23 Ultra at Work (Great battery life),9,116aa8a,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/116aa8a/my_first_day_of_testing_my_s23_ultra_at_work/,11,"So I tend to watch YouTube videos with headphones as I work(with work related apps opened in the background), and game/scroll social media when I can or during breaks. I'm pretty much a heavy user all day, even through work. All of this was on a 5G sim card with the screen the entire time.

I started my shift at 98%. I didn't have power saving  mode on during the first two hours of scrolling Twitter, reddit and watching YouTube. It got down to about 89%. 9% drop in two hours of use isn't bad. I was on pace to be around 56%, give or take at the end of the shift.

Once I noticed that power saving mode wasn't on, I turned it on and it greatly improved the performance. By the time I finished my shift, used Lyft for a 30 minute ride home(my car is currently in the shop) and continued watching YouTube until I was home, my battery was left at 70%. It felt like no matter what I could do this phone wouldn't die. I had so much left after heavy use....I was surprised. If I was even a medium user, this phone would definitely last me more than 1 day. I can't imagine what you'd get as a light user!

My old phone would get very hot under similar circumstances and I'd have to at least charge it twice while working. It was also very uncomfortable within my pocket because of the heat. Not only did I not have to charge the S23 Ultra once, it never got hot. It was cool as a cucumber in my pocket. The phone is still learning my habits and it's already doing this well. It's very much a 10/10 so far! I don't even have the urge to charge it as we speak lol.",1676813271.0

I can find the device only in 2 electronic shops in my country.
The model number is: NP750XFG-KA9DE.

Is anyone here who can tell me more about that book model? Is it made just to be given as an extra?

Went into expert raw, set ISO to 100, shutter speed to 30, resolution to 50mp, and pointed the phone at the brightest stars and digitally zoomed in all the way and used the manual focus to focus on stars.

I am furious right now and feeling horrible. I just had the worst experience shopping from Samsung Shop App.

&#x200B;

I ordered the S23 on launch day with the free fast brick and wireless charger. It was an exchange for my S22.

The delivery guy arrives and rejects my phone after seeing minor signs of usage. Wear and tear on the camera flag. I argue that this is not a scratch, and Samsung says this is acceptable. Mind you, I have already taken the Phone to a Samsung Smart Cafe, and it was clear that the phone was good for a full exchange offer. He argues it is a scratch and he won't take the phone.

Over this mark  https://imgur.com/JGK3xBu  

This is what Samsung Says on their website. But clearly doesn't practice. "" Ensure that the mobile phone is in working condition with its display  intact, and that it is not damaged, broken, or otherwise tampered with.  **Normal wear and tear is acceptable**. Ensure that you share correct  details of the used product, so that the partner’s associate can  validate the same successfully at the time of pickup. ""

So I raise a ticket with the Customer Care and some guy who was handling it, without even going through the pictures or reading my email properly. Just cancelled the whole order. With all the discounts, and freebies. That Idiot even failed to address me by my correct name, just an example of what an ignorant idiot he is.

&#x200B;

Now, I am just furious and extremely saddened by this experience. Samsung has a horrible Customer Care Service, and I am considering other options now. I definitely don't want to keep this S22 anymore, that's for sure.

I'm just a n00b, but I know my LG C2 dims on screens with heavy white/blue skies automatically, I think that's what they call Auto Brightness Limiter. Well, I loaded up a couple of apps with a white background, like Ampere when I was testing the battery (440 vs 630 discharge lmao), and the white looks more like an off-white on the S23 with this suped-up extra brightness setting, and the orange is also less saturated.

Usually, I don't notice a difference, but maybe one of the few people out there who have access to a base S22 and S23 can impart some knowledge about what's going on there. I like the look of the S22 more, if you saw it side by side although I'm burning my eyes and I'm sure it comes at a battery cost...but again I don't notice a whiteness/color difference on screens with a dark background

I tried taking a picture and you couldn't really see the whiteness difference in it, other than the orange looking different on Ampere",1676769095.0

Wait, I did all that yesterday. WTF.

Tapped the notif, got a window that listed like a dozen shitty games I have less than zero interest in, and the top said ""installed games, installed by mobile services manager."" Had to play the ""find and uninstall"" game on the shit it smeared onto my phone.

And of course it's marked as a system app so I had to enable the display of system apps in the app manager to see it. Also of course because it's marked as a system file I can only force-stop it, so as soon as I find out what the actual name for the package is I'm gonna be launching ye olde ADB and disabling/uninstalling it.

Apparently ""Mobile Services Manager"" is a shitware/bloatware autoinstaller (also/formerly known as ""DT Ignite"") that comes standard with the Android 13 distribution on the S23s, and carriers can use it to push crap onto the phone *without any user interaction or asking for user permission*. It's also a problem child with a several-year history as far as I can tell, and is even listed as a trojan by a few anti-malware apps.

Gotta love it when thousand-dollar phones come with a built-in ad dropper/PUP installer...

&nbsp;

UPDATE: Mobile services manager *reinstalled the same shitware that it did previously and I took off*! Had to go back through and re-remove the garbage games it dropped a second time. This time I was pissed off and grabbed an APK list app and found its two com files: com.dti.att (since I'm on AT&T) and com.dti.folderlauncher. Fired up ADB for some debugging, and uninstalled both. If they come back I'm nuking the files outright.

While I was at it I also ripped out Bixby, the AR stuff I don't use, the gaming stuff I also don't use as I don't play games on this phone, and a couple other odds and ends I don't or won't use that I find annoying (like Samsung Pass - if I want to put a password manager on there it'll be KeePass).

Thinking about getting the S23 (base) after 9 years of using only Sony Xperia and Google Pixel.,2,115mnc9,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115mnc9/thinking_about_getting_the_s23_base_after_9_years/,21,"Hello,

Since I had my first smartphone back in AUG 2013, I have only had two brands: Sony Xperia and Google Pixel. 

I tried to stay faithful to Sony, but the price of their phones is too high for what they are offering (only two major updates and ironically the camera isn't the best).

I switched to Pixel back in FEB 2021. My experience has been positive. The Pixel 4a is a very good device for its price (I paid US$390 because I exported it to my country). However, the battery is horrible. I am about to go to my first international trip since the pandemic and I am worried the phone won't let me take pictures. I bought a fast powerbank for now.

I have never had a Samsung phone. However, I've been using Samsung tablets for about 7 years. It's important to mention the way I use my tablet is different. I use it mostly to watch my weekly tv shows, reading and for YouTube and some music sometimes. That's it. That's why I was never bothered by the bloatware even if my A7 Lite only came with 32GB.

I could make a sacrifice and get the S23 base, but these are my worries.

**Bloatware**: My tablet is insanely bloated by a lot of apps you can disable, but not uninstall.

**Camera**: the Pixel 4a takes amazing pictures 95% of the time. The reviews of the S23 are good, but are the pictures as good as the Pixel's?

**Battery Life**: I don't expect 10hr, but can I expect 8hr of SoT on Wi-Fi?

**Support**: how many major updates is Samsung offering? 

The experience of those who have had Pixels is welcome.

Thanks",1676747282.0

I want OFF dynamic island. I'm downright sick of the iPhone. Sick of iOS. So plain, so boring. Zero innovation for the last 5+ years from Apple. All we got is a boring, lame, lifeless Dynamic Island.

U23 Ultra just arrived yesterday. Will this be my ticket OFF the Island? Pretty sick upon first impressions -- love the innovation, S-pen cool, works great. Display is second to none.. Also plays nice with my windows based PC. 

Not saying I'm going to keep it, as I've been here before... I may return it, who knows. But I am enjoying my time off the Island. 

Biggest pet peeve seems to be the lack of the lock screen turning ON when new alerts come in, as they do on the iPhone. I tend to miss alerts when my screen doesn't light up. I know there is ""glimpse notifications"" 3rd party app that I can download to utilize, but I really don't want to use a third party app to simply get notifications. Has Samsung created a solution for this apparent massive oversight yet? 

Ive also fired up my old Watch3, which seems to be working great in lieu of my Apple Watch Ultra. Trying to work out the kinks with Samsung Health and get used to how its interface works, as well. Working on transporting apps over, too (MyNetDiary, pacer, etc).

I bought a Onn wireless charger which I used to set the phone on at night to charge. When I put the phone on it the first night it was at 70%, when I got up the next morning it was at 63%. I chalked it up to me not having the charger in the right place on the phone or I had bumped it at night moving it to a spot where it didn't charge. Same thing happened the next night.

I have had the galaxy note 8 since release, and the battery has always been subpar. A few weeks ago I decided to run a diagnostic only to find out that a battery replacement is recommended. 

As I've never really encountered any other issues with this phone, be it mild or serious, I was wondering if a battery replacement would be cheaper down the line, or perhaps it may be time for divorce. 

Any feedback is welcome! Thank you all in advance!",1676723204.0

S23+ and its missing QHD+ resolution,3,115dh4w,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115dh4w/s23_and_its_missing_qhd_resolution/,32,"This really drives me crazy. Even my 8 year old S6 with its 5.1"" screen has QHD. Oc it's not all about the resolution and QHD is op for such a small device but I really don't get why Samsung degraded the resolution with the S21. 
Is it just because they want to upsell the Ultra?
However coming from a One Plus 7T Pro a switch to the Samsung flagships would feel like a downgrade in terms of the display.

Disappointing battery life of S21 ultra,0,115d73f,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115d73f/disappointing_battery_life_of_s21_ultra/,3,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to share some frustration with the battery life of my S21 ultra.

In March it's going to be two years since I bought the phone and I can't be more happy with it except one thing - battery life. It's HORRIBLE. 

I'm the kind of a person who really takes care of their phone because I plan to use it for at least 3 or 4 years. Because of that, I never charged my phone to 100%, only to 85%, made sure I don't discharge it too much (never below 30% really), never charged it overnight, you get the point. I'd say I'm a moderate user, where I'll use it for general texting and sometimes watching Twitch or Youtube for hour or two. 

All that gives me a battery life that's less than a day.  I previously owned Note 10 and the battery life there was way better than on the S21 Ultra. Because of that I decided to download battery app from store, charged my phone from 1% to 100% and got the great news ... Out of advertised 5000 mAh battery, I have left around 4200 mAh. 

4200 mAh is around 85% of the original capacity after two years of very careful use. To be fair I am really disappointed in the battery life of the phone, I expected it to easily last me a day but that's just not been possible for around a year now. 

I understand that the battery will obviously degrade over the years, but 15% degrade in two years with very careful handling of the phone just seems way to off for me. For comparison, my even older phone S7 still has battery life of 90%, after it's been used for 2 years by me and 1 year by my mom. Same goes for the Note 10 I gave her she's still using right, that phone is at 88% after being used 2 years by me and 2 years by her already. 

Does anyone else have similar experience with their phones? This is really frustrating me, and given how insane battery life iPhones have  at the moment it's really making me think about everything as someone who owned Samsung phones their whole life.",1676719229.0

S23+ battery life and other comments,27,115cblq,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115cblq/s23_battery_life_and_other_comments/,38,"Coming from an Exynos S10+, I am quite happy with the battery life and performance on the S23+ after about a week of using it. I started my day yesterday morning (8 am) with 100% and got about 8 hrs 45 mins of active Screen On Time (SOT) till today noon (15%) with heavy-ish usage. Screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/kwnH8yZ). I shuffle through, Spotify, Boost, YouTube, WhatsApp and news websites on Chrome mainly. I switch between WiFi and 5G but I think it's safe to say that it's about 70% WiFi. The display was set to 120 Hz and adaptive brightness was turned on. I also use my Galaxy Buds Plus to listen to music sparsely throughout the day. 

I am writing this post for people who are on the fence about upgrading from an Exynos S9/S10 to the S23+/S23U. I had a tough time deciding between the S23U and the S23+ as I really like the 10x optical zoom on the S23U but strongly dislike its shape and size. Also, I don't see myself using the S-Pen a lot. On the other hand, I really like the shape and design of the S23+ but was skeptical about the screen. I then realized that I had my S10+ on FHD+ and not WQHD+ throughout the last 3½ years. So, I finally went with the S23+ 512 GB and I must say, I am very happy with my decision. The switch from Exynos to Snapdragon is noticeable in terms of performance, battery and heat management as well. I don't have any problems with the screen at all (I did configure the screen zoom and font size to make it look the best) and I am very happy with the camera as well. 


Hope this post helps at least one person to make an informed decision. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions about the phone, will try my best to answer!",1676715736.0

i can't believe the color transition ( banding ) is still so bad on top of line S23 Ultra,0,115bo1g,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115bo1g/i_cant_believe_the_color_transition_banding_is/,20,"So Samsung has the known best OLED panel on the market for its S23U. I don't doubt. But whats wrong with Google and Samsung's own firmware and software support that makes the color banding still so bad on year 2023, not even good enough for a true 8 bit system, and so far benind any 8bit+FRC or even 10 bit system.

Dont lie to yourself it's unnoticeable. Look at the samsung default green-brown wallpapaer , upper left half,. See how tbr shades break with many boudaries going from dark to bright? There are a lot more scenes and GUI interfaces affected too.

And i am gonna prove it's even slightly worse than the samsung model 3 years ago. A random old iphone will beat the sxxx out of s23U. Everything shown here is less obvious than how it really looks i swear.

This one appears to be smooth on both S23U and iphone 12. But look at the incorrect transitions at arrows
. The 2 stripes are obviously darker than surroundings. It should become brighter all the way.  the iPhone has it done properly without any visual weiredness.

And then the famous Rtings gradient image. This is a 16 bit tiff. On iphone if opened in photos, it would be shown in 10 bit. And if opened in Safari it's 8 bit. Yes, iphone supports 10 bit with iOS 16. Dont be fooled. And i dont think any app supports 10 bit on S23U. 
https://i.imgur.com/xoGz1G4.jpeg

Look at the arrows where Note20U and S23 U show large jump in red and green. Interestingly it seems they appeared exactly at the same levels! So Samsung uses the identical LUT and color transform matrix between native and a standard color space for the panels 3 generations apart??

Again the contrast and artifacts are much more noticeable in reality. Steps in iphone at all and the transition is uniform and consistent. ( the weired pattern is from reflection) The Samsung models, due to only 8 bit depth, show edges wheenever a level changes , which is totally OK. What's bad is the sudden jumps in shades here and there. 

And s23U is even worse than note20 in some scenes because of the poorly calibrated gamma/LUT. 

This is the login screen of Southwest app. Look at the bigger jump of shade at the arrow for S23U.
https://imgur.com/a/Gfrb71h
 The  number of levels is the same for 2 models that i can confirm so there is no additional bit depth loss in S23. Its just that it's calibrated poorly.

So this is disappointing. I am not nitpicking such trivials and ruining people's good feelings about their adorable phone.  Its just sometimes these are so annoying to see and they ruin the scene by cutting an otherwise enjoyable screen with these ugly banding edges.

Best < 15/20 $ screen protector for impact protection AND working fingerprint reader on a Galaxy S22 ?,1,115b0vg,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/115b0vg/best_1520_screen_protector_for_impact_protection/,17,"Hi !

I'm currently looking for a screen protector for my brand new S22, but it seems like most screen protectors have issues with the fingerprint reader, or are hit-or-miss.

I already have a folio case (to protect the screen when it is closed), but as I tend to have clumsy hands (at least in the past), I would like one that has a rather good impact protection and a good value for money. 

My brother is quite happy with his JETech screen protector, but reviews for the S22 shows it doesn't work most of the time with the screen protector. Around 25 $ there also is the Rhinoshield Impact Protection, which is very tough, but reviews are pretty bad, so it doesn't seems like it is as good as it used to be for that price.

There also is amFilms screen protectors (Hybrid or OneTouch, not the +30 $ one), but I would like more reciews on the impact protection side aswell as on potential issues with the fp reader.

I also saw the Milomdoi screen protector, and also the Supershieldz tempered glass which seems good, I guess ? What do you think ?

I read a lot of posts on various subreddits, but people are basically looking for a scratch-resistant protector. Most people seems to buy expensive WSD and amFilms tempered glass or Samsung's official screen protector, while a majority of them agrees that expensive screen protectors are in practice almost the same as cheaper ones.

I think I know where “Bixby” got its name from. 🖖🏼,242,1153aev,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1153aev/i_think_i_know_where_bixby_got_its_name_from/,35,"As far as I know, there’s no official explanation given nor sufficient information found online, as to where SAMSUNG’s voice assistant Bixby gets its name from. There are some suggestions that it’s chosen because it’s a unique name and does not bring any trademark issues, so it was safe to be named as Bixby. So, according to my research, it was almost fully unknown. Well, until now… It might not be the actual case, but I’m convinced it’s the closest guess to the origin of the name Bixby. 

In Star Trek The Original Series, there’s an episode named “Mirror, Mirror” which is the fourth episode from the second season. The episode was first broadcast on October 6, 1967 and it was ranked as one of top ten ""must see"" episodes of the original series, and one of the most celebrated ones. 

In the episode, we see the crew communicating with the ship’s computer and the computer answering questions and computing the commands given by the crew like a modern day voice assistant, like Bixby, Siri, Alexa. 
It wasn’t of course the first time computer appearing in the series so far, but I believe it was indeed the first episode in which the communication between the voice assistant and the crew was this much advanced. 

“Mirror, Mirror” episode was written by Jerome Bixby, a writer highly acclaimed by the critics, and this was the first of the four episodes he wrote for the series. 

And, as a matter of fact, the developers or the company was inspired by this computers advancement which was created by Jerome Bixby, and SAMSUNG is paying tribute to him and his legacy. 

I’m ready to be proven wrong! Go ahead. 🖖🏼",1676683332.0

is it worth upgrading from S22U (exynos version) to S23U just for the new Snapdragon chip?,12,114zs4o,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/114zs4o/is_it_worth_upgrading_from_s22u_exynos_version_to/,105,"So I upgraded from the S20 5G to the S22 Ultra when it came out last year.
I like the phone, I think it's a great phone (though I still struggle to use the camera - I find the camera interface not very intuitive at all, and think the iPhone cameras are better in that regard. I was a bit disappointed by the S22U and even the S20 cameras, only becuase I find them non intuitive. If I sat down and properly looked into it, I'm sure I'd find them much better).

BUT I'm in the UK, and I know my phone has an Exynos chip and I think that may be the source of my problems. 

- Not being able to use the camera after viewing an image taken, unless I close (quit) and reopen the camera app, which is very annoying for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it type scenario 
- phone keyboard sometimes freezing and playing catch up (sometimes if I try delete a few characters it'll glitch then catch up and delete whole words amd sentences) 
- phone being frozen on (only a handful of times, and somehow I've been able to resolve it each time) and having a notification pop up saying UI is not responding. 

It doesn't happen all the time, and it's not a low storage issue as its a 512GB with 318GB used.

I'm debating whether to trade in my S22U and upgrade to the S23U but I'm not sure if it's too much just for the new chip? 
The new camera is a bonus, but again I've said I struggle a bit with them and find I can't use them to their full potential.

If I trade in online, and apply the code S23BOOST I can get up to £750 off (anyone who doesn't have a smartphone to trade in/doesn't want to,  the code S23SAVE gives £100 off instantly) and get it for I think £629, though it won't ship til the 3rd March. 

I've also not done an online trade in, and would worry Royal Mail strikes would mean my phone gets lost and I don't get the upgrade discount; I'd rather do it in store. 
Anyone know if Samsung Stores honour online voucher codes? 

Anyway, what are your thoughts on this?",1676673526.0

Is there a way for me to change the font color of Google Calendar's widget? There's no widget specific setting I can seem to find, unfortunately.

Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 two weeks later,22,114vjlm,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/114vjlm/samsung_galaxy_book3_pro_360_two_weeks_later/,20,"After using the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 for two weeks, I'd like to share my thoughts on this laptop. The aluminum chassis is attractive, and its compact size makes it easy to carry around. I had to adjust to the larger touchpad as my previous laptop had a smaller one, but it didn't take long to get used to it. Although I wish the keyboard had more depth, it's still comfortable to type on. ~~The laptop lacks a fingerprint reader~~ and only has one USB type-A port, but it compensates for that with two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and an HDMI port. The battery life is great, and I was able to use it all day without needing to charge it.

&#x200B;

The laptop's performance is impressive, and I was able to run multiple tabs, documents, and presentations without any issues. Although I haven't tried gaming on it, it runs lightweight games smoothly. The webcam quality is disappointing, and I hope that laptop manufacturers will start including better cameras as video calls are becoming increasingly common. The laptop has not overheated, except for one instance when I accidentally left it running in my laptop bag. The screen quality is fantastic, with accurate colors and the 3:2 aspect ratio makes it immersive for work or entertainment. The Dolby Atmos sound also enhances the streaming and movie-watching experience. Overall, I think this laptop is a great choice for students, teachers, or anyone looking for a reliable, lightweight, and premium-quality laptop for a good price.

Other Notes:

&#x200B;

\* Battery Life: 10-12 hours casual use, medium brightness

\* Charge time: Little over an hour depending if I am using it or not

\* Touchscreen: Responsive and accurate

\* Pen: Inconvenient as there is no place to dock it, you have to stick it to the back of the screen.

\* Gaming: Not a gaming laptop, emulators run smooth, Sims 4 is smooth as well

\* Not a dust magnet

\* Easy to pair with the phone but I have not found a real reason to control my phone with the laptop (just seems like a gimmick) other than to send over photos",1676662752.0

My S23U Results (I'm using official samsung 65W Charger although Samsung S23U is limited to 45w)

1% to 73% 30min 45W charge (it says Supercharge 2.0 when plugged) (phone is turned on+Wifi)

1% to 57% 30min 25w Charge (It says Super charge only when plugged) (Phone is on+Wifi)

Sure its only 16% Difference (Beats the 1% with S22U) but mentally leaving the house with 70%+ battery is different than 50%+ :P when you are in a rush

Samsung is cheap though for not including it for free.

Edit : The full time to charge using 45w is 58min to me (from 1% to 100% while phone is on)

so yeah the last 27% Charge takes as much as the first 73% kinda

Please help me decide on a color!,0,114lh74,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/114lh74/please_help_me_decide_on_a_color/,28,"Hi, all. I got both a red s23 ultra and a graphite s23 ultra. I ordered both because stores in my area don't have any demos, and I couldn't get the right feel for what they looked like IRL without having them in my hand.

Anyway, they both finally arrived yesterday, but I am so torn. I love BOTH colors so much. The matte black everything on the sides, around the cameras, the bottom, etc. looks so good with both the graphite and red color. I usually ALWAYS have black or gray phones, so I was actually leaning towards going for something crazy different for me (the red), but the graphite looks really good... I can't decide!

Please help! Which one do you like better? Maybe you can help me make up my mind...

I usually end up with a dbrand skin and a clear case eventually, so I don't typically worry much about getting anything but black... but I'm excited by a new color!

EDIT: I know graphite won by a landslide, but as I was packaging up the red to return it, I felt really disappointed. Thus, I kept the red! The heart knows what it wants. *shrug*

I went S10 > iPhone 13 Pro > S23+,35,114ldde,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/114ldde/i_went_s10_iphone_13_pro_s23/,14,"Had always been an Android user since the Galaxy S2. Then had the S4, Note 4, Moto XT1575, OG Pixel, S10.

I really went to an iPhone 13 Pro as I wanted a normal sized phone (around 6"") with 512gb storage. In the US you're basically limited to Apple, Samsung and Google. I had first tried the Pixel 7 Pro and S22 Ultra.

The Pixel 7 Pro had a few odd scrolling related bugs that really annoyed me. I would have otherwise maybe kept it even if it was a bit too big for my liking. The S22U was really too big and the sharp corners were very uncomfortable to hold.

So I got an iPhone and used it for 3 months. There is honestly a lot to like about it. The phone is generally smooth and most of the apps are well designed. But then slowly the annoyances started to build:

* No universal back gesture. Most of the time the back gesture worked, but sometimes it didn't and that was annoying
* Animations are great on iPhone but you also always need to wait for them to finish before you can interact with the screen
* Managing photos and files is impossible if you want to do it any other way than Apple intended
* Keyboards all suck. My text input was generally a lot slower
* Notifications are messy overall, though I do like the badges on the app icons (on Android when you dismiss a notification the badge also disappears which is dumb)
* My biggest annoyance was needing to use iTunes to put anything on the phone, like music and old photos. Such an antiquated way of doing things. You first need to create a whole Playlist library to mimic your folder structure and then import it all to your phone and then each time you want to add anything you need to sync the Library instead of just copying the file like on Android. And then for some reason each time it would resync 3500 songs! Pissed me off to no end.
* The Apple app store is a capitalist hellscape. Almost everything wants to nickel and dime you, charge a subscription here, charge a subscription there. I don't mind supporting the developer of a good app, but a lot of apps you only need to use every now and again so no, I'm not paying you $5 a month for your shitty app. 

So now I got the S23+. There was a lot to like about the iPhone, don't get me wrong. But it's good to be back to a device that just gives me more freedom to do what I want. Android you can use out of the box and be perfectly content, or you can tweak it. And that's just why I prefer Android. It's better for me.

And the S23+ is a great device. Right on the edge of what I can handle size wise (any bigger is a no go). Though I would've preferred the regular S23 still, but no 512 gb storage on that in the US.",1676643341.0

Looking at the estimated horizontal and vertical accuracy, the S23U achieves 3.8/2.5 meters, while the S22U on Exynos achieves 1.5/2.0 meters at the same time holding the phones side by side. I'm using the GSPTest app [GPSTest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.gpstest) Those are screenshoots from my tests:

Truly impressive knowing that I was 3h in an area without good network coverage which probably was heavy on the battery.

In perspective, the similar day with my 4 years old s9+ i would come home with 15/20% battery if I'm optimistic.

With this in mind I know I can safely use the 85% charging limit option that samsung offer to avoid reducing lifespan of the battery by remaining too much in the 85/100 range.

I feel that this phone could last easily 3 days if used in economic mode with network partially activated for a long weekend in the wild for example.

Samsung QN700B 8k seems seriously flawed and even rtings is vastly downplaying the issue.,0,113zz8j,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113zz8j/samsung_qn700b_8k_seems_seriously_flawed_and_even/,18,"**A while ago I started heavily looking into 8k TV for PC productivity powerhouse setup.**

I currently use a 40"" 4k monitor, and saw 55"" 8k as a huge upgrade. But first my task was to go to local Currys to see the display in person, and my first impression was rather poor. 8k screen looked significantly worse than nearby 4k screen of same 55"" size. **This also applies to 65"" QN800B**


I noticed that the mild dithering in shadows mentioned by Rtings is actually significantly worse, and even over 2ft away this was very visible in form of jagged high contrast edges, which appeared sharp and straight on a 4k TV next to it.

I also had a chat with the rep, who quickly admitted that 8k TVs are a serious gimmick and even the rep recommended staying away.

Unfortunately they didn't allow me to test a laptop input into the TV to see if that changes anything about the pixel dithering issue. 

I played with the remote and tried switching the picture modes (game mode or pc mode was absent), and the dithering only became worse when I took off the 'in the shop' mode.

So I started investigating and learned about the Contrast modulation, and how it affects picture quality. Samsung's 8k TVs have very low contrast modulation compared to many 4k TVs they also make. It is related to how Samsung uses neighboring pixels to improve contrast in sharp edges, thus creating the dithering effect.

The next thing I realized, that all of this issue is heavily downplayed, not really mentioned or discussed at all.

People buy 8k TVs fairly blindly due to absence of serious warnings even from RTINGS. One fellow /r/monitors user has been very frustrated with his QN700B and it's dithering issue. As I see no solution, i've recommended him to try refunding it, or replacing for different (4k) model.

------
**TLDR:**

So the real reason why I posted this is... I want 8k TV owners to come out and discuss their issues and possible solutions. 

Let me know if plugging HDMI 2.1 PC into this TV actually affects dithering or is it really a no go, as I still wish to have a 8k 55"" screen for graphical work.

And spread the word so people don't end up with an expensive unwanted TV.

The penetration of marketing achieved here is perhaps one of the greatest launches of our generation, reaching all corners of the globes across all platforms.

First proper day of s23+ usage. 24% battery remains...

Mix of wifi and 4g , I only charged to 85% using that setting,  probably won't use that going forward.

Settings,  brightness not over 50%.
Everything else normal.

Results seem... OK,  idk I was expected a bit more , 5ish SOT if I charged to 100% 

Seems miles away from what some people here are getting.. 

Thoughts?  I'm loving the phone but thought battery would be a bit better.

S23 Ultra weird behaviour,1,113yhja,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113yhja/s23_ultra_weird_behaviour/,1,"**Eye Comfort Shield messes with black levels.**

Once Enhanced Comfort is turned on, any pixel that should be entirely black doesn't turn off but rather dims down to a level that's decided by the current brightness setting.

So at high brightness, what should be black is actually very prominently grey.

""Adjust colour tones and contrast.."" yeah, contrast. Just why?

&#x200B;

**The refresh-rate doesn't  doesn't appear to go below 24Hz.**

This LTPO tech is really poorly understood in general. Some reports  indicate that the S22 can drop down to 24Hz, while Samsung themselves  state that it can't go below 48Hz.

Additionally, there's a theory that  the GPU only renders at 1FPS on the Ultra models, but the screen is  actually refreshing at 24Hz.

However, some have reported it showing as  low as 10Hz, so nobody really knows for sure.",1676574842.0

S23 Ultra + Whitestone Dome Tempered Glass Review,9,113vnlh,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113vnlh/s23_ultra_whitestone_dome_tempered_glass_review/,22,"So I have heard the grumblings about Whitestone and such on here, and I know that there's case compatibility issues.  Just going to share my experience so far.

I got my S23 Ultra yesterday and pretty much the first thing I did was to install the screen protector.  The installation has quite a few steps, but their video is pretty good.  Just be careful, go slow, and you should be fine.  I have a few tips for the install:

1 - Put a piece of paper or something under the jig to catch drips of adhesive.  It doesn't all stay contained under the screen protector and the absorption pads well...they mostly work but not all the way.

2 - After the adhesive is fully spread out under your protector, it is still pretty easy to move if you lightly press it.  This allows you to align it perfectly before curing.  HOWEVER, if your surface is not level it can still move during curing.  Also, the rubber block they have you place over the lower end can cause it to move slightly.  So I recommend after removing the block but before starting the curing process, realign the top-to-bottom position if you need and make sure it's level.

3 - The speaker cover sticker is a bit of a pain since the sticker portion is so thin.  You might use a toothpick to help stick it down over the speaker.  Though with that said, it didn't look like any adhesive went anywhere near the speaker, but better safe than sorry.

4 - If you're going to use a case, install the phone in your case first and then place the screen protector on the phone to see how it fits before removing the back sticker on the protector.  This will let you see if there are any problems.

I had heard of problems with the Unicorn Beetle cases and it's true still with the S23 Ultra and Whitestone combo.  There is not quite enough room in the corners for the protector to fit, but again the case doesn't extend enough to completely cover and ""hold down"" the edges of the protector.  I would bet that if I had put my phone into the UB Pro case it would have caused the protector to start pulling away from the phone.

I am using a Poetic Spartan case and it fits perfectly!  It doesn't touch the protector and so far there are no signs of any problems.  Also the Poetic Revolution looks like it should work.  So check your case fit first, it either needs to not touch or have enough overlap to be putting downward pressure evenly across the protector, though I suppose that could also cause issues.  Best bet is not touching at all IMO.

Installation went well with no issues, so you should be fine taking into account the tips above.  Go slow, watch the video a few times to make sure you're comfortable with all the steps.

Fingerprint!  It works just fine and it's fast.  No problems at all for me so far.

It looks great, can't really tell that it's on the screen.  There are a few dots around the edge of the protector that you will see when it's not installed.  I don't notice them at all.  Not sure what they are for, but you can't see them after installation.

It does get fingerprints, but I'm not sure it's any better/worse than the regular phone glass.  So far I'm quite happy with it.  No, I'm not going to be doing any intentional drop tests lol.

I also got the Whitestone camera lens protector kit, which was super easy to install and works great as well.

No, I have no affiliation with Whitestone, Poetic or Supcase.  I just wanted to get some details out for anyone else who might be interested in what options are available.  I do also like amFilm protectors, I had one on my old phone (S20+), but the Unicorn Beetle interfered with it and I ended up just using a film on it instead of the tempered glass, but have been running the phone with no protector for about a year now and it's been fine also.

Side note, the S20+ w/ Unicorn Beetle Pro case is not really that much smaller than the S23U with the Poetic Spartan.",1676567618.0

Like many here I used to do the pre-order every year and trade in my previous device but Samsung nerfed the trade-in values, accessory credits, heck even the $25 total discount from last year for doing the 4-payment system.
So anyways, I was clicking around on eBay to see what people were selling their used S22U's for and it's a mixed bag.

Then I went ""alright fine, I'll do it"" but then everything I could use ""accessory-wise"" is sold out. We have GW4's so we don't need new watches but even most of the GW5/Pro variations are sold out. The Rugged Gadget Case is sold out, the (new) 45W chargers are sold out, the 10,000mAh 25W PD battery packs are sold out... I can't think of anything else to get to use up the accessory credit

I really wanted to wait to see what the next sales will be but the kicker is the free storage upgrade that's currently available. Every other year it wouldn't have mattered but Samsung this year lowered the base RAM of the S22U to 8GB and I normally use more than 8 with regular use. So for this version I would need the 512 version (which I hate by the way cuz I usually hover around 100GB usage for like the last 6 years...).

Second full day of use coming from my iphone,18,113lawb,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113lawb/second_full_day_of_use_coming_from_my_iphone/,17,"As mentioned, this is the second full day of use. 

Thoughts: 

Performance:
The phone has been more than snappy and I have yet to see any lag, glitches, etc. Coming from an iPhone 12 pro max, which has been remarkably powerful even to date, it has been more than powerful enough for *my* use 

Software:
I'm somewhat new to android, so keep my bias in mind. The android software has been more than snappy, so not really an issue with that. But coming from iOS, which I've enjoyed a lot, it's been different. Obviously. I did enjoy how iOS was simple and seemingly easier to navigate. But that's my opinion as someone only two days into a new OS. It's different but not bad at all

Battery: 
This is pretty high on my priorities. While I'm not a power user, my phone is always doing something. I work in the automotive industry in quality and I am constantly using my phone to take photos, record measurements, use as a calculator, and more. And when I'm home I listen to a lot, watch some videos, browse around, etc. I consider myself the average user plus a little more. For the last few days of use, my use has been average plus probably an extra 30 minutes of screwing around. Checking on my old phone, the last few day's screen on time has matched my rolling average on my phone. I've linked a Google drive folder at the bottom of the post for a Screenshot. As of right now I have 5:01 screen on, 6:40 screen off and am at 41%. The phone says 11:42 used, with 7:18 left. I'm more than happy! I do also have the 45w anker charger and it was a full charge in just slightly over an hour. So the average power user should be more than fine. Obviously, my continued use will show if this is true. 

Camera:
I use my camera a lot. I take a lot of photos for work, of trips, my jeep, and more,  and I have the 38,000 photos to prove it.  So a decent camera is another high priority. For quick photos, it seems to be perfect. Snap a picture and there it is! Has done well in low light, shutter lag has been reasonable, and just generally happy. The pro raw mode has been a treat! I like how I have total control of ISO, shutter speed, focus, and more. The focus is pretty cool how it'll highlight the in-focused areas a neon green. I like making videos in my free time and having this focus control makes even my proper DSLR feel a bit out of date. Not to say this will replace the considerably larger sensor, better zoom, and dedicated controls of it. But it will absolutely make me reach for the phone in my back pocket over the DSLR in my bag more often. Tonight I put my phone on my portable stand, pointed it at the sky, adjusted the focus, set iso to 100, shutter speed to 30s, and took a pic of the night sky! This was a 50mp photo and unedited, also part of the link below. I was very impressed with the long exposure. There was considerable light pollution in my area, so keep that in mind. But in this singular use case, I firmly believe I couldn't have taken a better photo on my proper DSLR. I'm going camping next weekend and look forward to testing then. I love the camera. Not too much of a fan with the pro raw being a separate app. I wish it was baked into the camera app. But eh, whatever. 

Do I regret swapping from my iPhone 12 pro max to the s23 ultra? Not as of right now! It's a snappy phone, has proven to have a good battery, camera is great, and proving to be a solid phone. There's a few nuances that are different coming from my iPhone, but I'll adjust just fine.

The link is in a comment, couldn't add it here. Keep in mind that there is some photo compression here. It looks more clear on the device",1676534190.0

In the case of loss, do you return the original device if it is later recovered and would they cover that shipping cost? And what happens to that device, can they remotely lock it as a stolen device so even if ""lost"" someone finding it can't get into my old device? Or would it still function?

S23 vs S23 Ultra,7,113irf2,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113irf2/s23_vs_s23_ultra/,5,"I could get the S23 base model with 256gb for 715€ and the S23 Ultra 512gb for 1050€.
I could also get the S23+ for 930€ but this doesn't seem to make sense in my opinion.

So I am debating between the base model and the Ultra.
I am in love with the small form factor of the S23 but the extra 335 for the better camera, display, battery, storage and resale value seem like a no-brainer.

I think even if I decide to sell the Ultra after 1 month bc it turned out to be too big for me, I could make money out of this deal. Am I wrong?

zfold 3 to S23U after one week and I am glad I made the switch and whoever thinks that S23U is a boring phone think again.,4,113fmnv,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/113fmnv/zfold_3_to_s23u_after_one_week_and_i_am_glad_i/,4,"I had the zfold 3 since launch and I loved the Fold concept and looks since I took it out of the box. I enjoyed so much the ability to read books, browse the web, games and multitask. I initially used the Fold spend a lot but since I couldn't figure out a way to keep it with me it went into the drawer and just forgot about it.

After using the zfold3 for a while I started to discover the negatives of owning a Fold device 

1. Typing experience, regardless of which screen the typing experience was always painful. Tried different keyboards and ended up just using voice to dictate. 


2. Battery life is horrible on average I used to get 4.5 SOT. Yes I can disable stuff to get a longer battery life but what's the point of having an expensive dive while I don't use all of its capabilities

3. I casually go on bike rides and I like to use my phone as navigation unfortunately with the zfold 3 it's impossible to mount a heavy device and with any bumps, the device will fall. So throughout my time with zfold 3 I couldn't take it on a bike ride. Adding to this when going just jogging it not possible to keep the heavy device in your pocket cause it will keep bouncing around. 


4. I started a YouTube channel and using the zfold 3 for taking videos actually exceeded my expectations however I couldn't figure out any gimbal tha5 can support this device 

5. Apps are not optimized especially YouTube when switching between screens and the performance of the device was just not there at times lags sometimes 

Long story short zfold devices are a very productive devices however as you can see from above mentioned points it's not practical device. Finally I started to notice that a lot of people on zfold forums complain that the inner screen get the death line or the split line whatever you want to call it.

Therefore I placed my order the day S23U was announced. I initially thought OK I am back to normal phone and this is going to be boring. But after using the phone for almost a week this is by the most complete package phone I've ever used. 

1. Performance check
2. Battery life check 
3. Lighter weight compared to zfold 3 sure it a larger huge device but I started to get used to it
4. Typing experience check 
5. Camer quadruple check. Wow on the performance of these cameras. 
6. Spen built-in check 

The list can keep going but in all fairness the most annoying thing about the S23 U compared to zfold 3 is the fingerprint scanner I prefer so much the one on the zfold 3 since it's a hardware button it worked 99% of the time. S23U is good but not as good as the zfold 3 and I hope Samsung can just use hardware fingerprint scanners on the power button instead of under the display. 

The Fold technology for me is still in R&D phase and requires lots of areas to improve while the S line has reached to level where you are going to get a consistent experience mature with no surprises and this is what I am experiencing with the S23U mature and a complete package.",1676514482.0

Coming from a European S22 (Exynos) IT IS THE REMEDY.

Besides that EU relief, it's an amazing phone.

Batterylife is stellar, I got roughly 6 hours of onscreen time out of it because I am on holiday excited to try my new phone and have time, compared to my measly 4 hours at mildly light usage (if at all most of the time) from the S22, given the highly light usage, it would double.

The S22 I've owned only for a month and managed to sell it without loss when the S23 launched (got it second hand new), originally coming from an S9+ which I broke myself through a work related accident (there was no need to upgrade, the S9+ was amazing), I'm so glad about the changes Samsung made besides the european Exynos problems. 

It's a huge step up even from the last chip and AI with essentially the same camera still does make a Great difference. 

I mean, the GPU outperforms the iPhone 14 Pro Max which has a dedicated silicon and is (depending whether it's the regular iPhone 14 or Pro / Max) matching it's CPU performance / outperforming it in single core (1975 points I've had). It's so good to the point hat it almost has the same performance as an Intel 8700k (whoever knows what that means), a still, very capable and powerful Desktop CPU.

But yeah the battery life man, I have no words, same feeling, even better when I had my 9+ for the first time.

I think, given the underwhelming YouTubers' reception of it as a mild update is just wrong.

They took what was great about the previous phone and perfected it. This phone will last you and will make you very happy both causal- and productivly.

I don't understand why it's been socially, on the internet, received so poorly, it's simply amazing, a powerhouse with refined features, great battery life and an outblasting performance. It basically is better than the current iPhone being an Android device.

It just goes to show how weird and affiliated today's ""influencers"" are, or possibly spoiled and don't get a clear picture of what's happening anymore.

If Apple had been on a low for a while and managed to get on the same silicon level with better camera quality, it would flood your YouTube search without even relevant context in between.

The official Samsung silicone cases for the S23 line are really nice.,22,1138xm8,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1138xm8/the_official_samsung_silicone_cases_for_the_s23/,15,"I picked up the Samsung silicone grip case yesterday for my new S23 Ultra, and it's great. I was worried about it feeling sticky, having problems putting it in my pocket, or having it get covered with dust, dead skin, etc. based on what I'd read about other silicone cases (including past Samsung silicone cases), but I'm not having any of these problems.

The texture feels perfect. It feels soft compared to a TPU case, and it has enough grip to make the phone feel stable in my hand (even without using the strap). It doesn't make the phone feel bulky. (I actually feel like most modern phones are too thin, so the little bit of extra thickness feels good, but it doesn't add too much to the width of the phone.)

The strap is very sturdy. It easily keeps the phone attached to my hand even if I'm not holding it, but it doesn't get in the way when I'm holding the phone normally.

Unless the material dramatically changes with wear, I don't anticipate it picking up dust or debris. I have the dark gray/black version, so it would be noticeable.

Anyway, I hadn't found many reviews on this case, so I just thought I'd make a quick post for anyone who had similar concerns to mine. I can only compare this to a couple of other cases (the last being a Spigen), but I'm quite pleased so far.",1676496194.0

Galaxy S23 Ultra Review (From a Fold 4/S22 ultra User),6,11380cj,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/11380cj/galaxy_s23_ultra_review_from_a_fold_4s22_ultra/,3,"Samsung does it again, as they always do.  

I change phones every 6 months. No phone has ever made me want to keep it for more than that time.  But the truth is, anyone shelling out the money to buy a Flagship galaxy device is going to have a decent experience overall.  These are samsung's best phones and righfully so, they aren't cheap.   They can easily last you 3 to 4 years (even longer) if you're a responsible person that knows how to take care of things (using a decent case, screen protector, never drop it etc).

S23 ultra compared to the s 22 ultra

Refined and improved in every way.  Any weird quirk you found annoying about the s22 ultra has been fixed or addressed with the S23 ultra.  My biggest issues with it were battery life and speaker quality, which, compared to most other devices outside of the samsung eco system, is not even a problem.  But since we're knit picking here I'll mention them.  


s23 ultra compared to the Z fold 4

the camera and processor of the fold 4 are starting to show their age (not really , but compared to the s23 ultra sure).  That's just from my preference on how I see this fold 4.  The sound on the fold 4 is better than the s22 ultra in terms of clarity, but it isn't as loud as the s22 ultra.  The s23 ultra sounds much better than the fold 4.  Not by much but I do notice the difference.  Much more clear at the loudest setting compared to the s22 ultra.  The fold 4 isn't loud enough for my taste.  And even though the camera is decent on the fold 4 I can tell it's not as quality which hurts it. 

The unfolded display is the fold 4's saving grace.  Even with the crease it's pleasant to use.   But the front display is a tragic joke, barely usable.  Samsung needs to hurry up and make that front display the same size as the ultra devices.  having a 6.8 display in the front and then being able to unfold it for a tablet size...that's my game over scenario for how samsung takes over the cell phone market.  

The chinese phone makers already have a foldable phone that's similar to what I'm talkng about, I can't remember the name but it's also very thin.  The technology is there but Samsung is getting more and more like apple with how long they'll hold off to give people what they really want.  

The Fold user interface has finally caught up to regular phone layout quality interface.  It's much more intuitive and isn't just a bigger version of what you would see on a regular phone.  They're actually utilizing the extra space.  The fold 3 had dogshit UI when it came out.  I look forward to seeing what Sammy does with the fold 5.  They actually have decent competition with the chinese phone makers so I hope that makes them get off their asses and give us something decent (get rid of the crease, built in s pen, and bigger battery, and bigger FRONT DISPLAY...that's a tall list but I can dream),

The s23 ultra is tried and true.  I can't wait to see samsung refining and improving their foldables the same way they're doing with the Galaxy regular phone line up.  I will miss the large screen of the fold 4, but I won't miss that front tiny display, it was unusable and I merely tolerated it because I could unfold it.  


Big takeaways I'm noticing with the s23 ultra.  

Samsung already has amazing wifi/connectivity/service.  But with each new phone it seems like they keep pushing the envelope even more.  Wifi connects even smoother with this bad boy.  Cell phone quality and blue tooth feel even more refined.  

Also, moving all my info between devices has gotten even easier.  It took even less time to move everything over from my fold 4 to the s23 ultra.  

Things just connect better/faster with the s23 ultra.  

Samsung has the best quality control on the planet.  Their phones are the best bang for the buck.  They aren't cheap but compared to apple you're going to get your money's worth.",1676493783.0

Notes:

* I do a lot of computer hardware tinkering so I'm fairly familiar with many tools
* I don't plan on disassembling the device for the time being
* I'll post updates on this OP as I find things

Machine Configuration: i7-1360p/16GB/1TB

Findings:

* The hinge is difficult to open with one finger, but possible if there's enough friction on the bottom
* Screen coating: glossy, NOT laminated
   * Both adaptive color and auto brightness are supported
   * Display HDR certification is DisplayHDR500 True Black
   * Refresh rate options are listed as ""Dynamic (60 Hz or 120 Hz)""/120 Hz/60 Hz
   * Dynamic mode seems to do a decent job of boosting up to 120 Hz when needed (scrolling, moving mouse), but isn't quite as perfect as it is on a phone.  I definitely still notice some 60 Hz in there.
* SSD model: WDSN740-SDDPNQD-1T00-1004, Seems to be a Western Digital SN740: [https://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/pc-sn740-ssd#SDDPNQD-1T00](https://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/pc-sn740-ssd#SDDPNQD-1T00), which is the OEM version of the WD SN770
   * 5150/4900 Read/Write 740k/800k Random
   * Seems like it should be 2280, so bodes well for replaceability
   * AS SSD (high power mode): [https://i.imgur.com/xTiamDb.png](https://i.imgur.com/xTiamDb.png),  [https://imgur.com/VSqEbJs.png](https://imgur.com/VSqEbJs.png)
   * Afaik this is *the* fastest DRAM-less PCIE4.0 SSD on the market.  The lack of DRAM makes this one of the most power- and energy-efficient NVMe SSDs, so I actually think this was a very good choice.
* RAM timings: DDR5-5200 @ 60-48-48-112-160-1T, reporting as Quad Channel?
* Power Limits:
   * Silent: PL1 = 20W, PL2 = 64W
   * Quiet: PL1 = 20W, PL2 = 64W
   * Optimized: PL1 = 28W, PL2 = 64W
   * High Performance: PL1 = 28W, PL2 = 64W
* Cinebench R20 scores (68F ambient, external monitor):
   * Silent: 3395/642
   * Quiet: 3344/665
   * Optimized: 4092/665
   * High Performance: ​4140/(didn't test)
* All single-core scores are effectively the same; expect similar single-thread performance in bursty workloads regardless of the mode.
* Seems like there's not really any penalty for bursty workloads (even multi-core ones) for Silent vs. Quiet or Optimized vs. High Performance.  The difference between scores can likely be entirely attributed to the difference in PL1.
* Silent mode really is silent for Cinebench.  The fans never spun up at all.
* 3DMark Scores (68F ambient, external monitor, high performance mode, driver version 31.0.101.4032):
   * Timespy: 1977/1750 graphics/7556 cpu:  [Generic VGA video card benchmark result - Intel Core i7-1360P Processor,SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD. NP940XFG-KC1US (3dmark.com)](https://www.3dmark.com/3dm/89308474?)

   * This is a bit faster than the Steam Deck's performance, so I would use that as a rough gauge if you're interested in gaming on this laptop.
   * Closest desktop GPU I could find is the GT 1030
   * Don't expect miracles, but it should be serviceable for 900p gaming (integer scaling on the 2880 x 1800 display) at 30\~60 fps on modern games.  Should handle lighter weight games easily at full resolution at 120 fps.
* Samsung Update showed three things to install: Samsung System Support Service, Windows Configuration, and Camera driver
* Camera is *extremely* wide angle.  If I had to guess maybe around 18mm?  Quality seems good for a laptop webcam
* Protect Battery is available in Samsung Settings which limits battery charging to 85%
* Yes McAfee is preinstalled :(
* There are 3 keyboard backlight brightness settings (+ off = 4 total)
* Best fitting sleeve I've found so far is the 14"" INVZI MacBook Sleeve
* Keyboard travel is extremely shallow with a very distinct detent.  Not a huge fan so far, but maybe it will grow on me.  At first blush, I'm not typing very well.",1676485666.0

For me, it's indispensable because it's basically a mouse for my S22U. Helps with editing photos and videos, taking selfies and group photos, hover to translate is extremely helpful, and selecting text anywhere.

Perhaps most importantly for me is creating notes with chemical formulas of organic compounds and annotating carbon atom numbers within them and functional groups would've been impossible without the s pen.

Finally, studies show that handwriting, as opposed to typing on a keyboard, is better for learning and memory:

These are the reasons I chose the S23 (8GB/256GB),16,1132ff2,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1132ff2/these_are_the_reasons_i_chose_the_s23_8gb256gb/,14,"I've been using the S23 since 4th February and I can tell you it is worth it!

**- Price and where I bought it**

I bought it on Amazon Business (Spain), for 912,84€ (23% VAT included,  742,15€ no VAT), and it came with a 45W wall charger and 2 USB cables. I used the promo code SAMSUNGS23 to get 103€ of discount. By law, in Portugal and Spain we have 3 years of mandatory warranty. I made the order on the presentation day and it was delivered on the 4th of February. I had no problems since I could return it for free if I didn't want it or if the reviews were really bad!

**- Previous Smartphone and why I no longer use it**

My previous smartphone was the Poco F2 Pro 8GB/256GB from 2020. At the time and in terms of price/performance ratio, it was one of the best. Unfortunately, after 2 years and 2 months, it never turned on again. Also, in 2020, the mandatory warranty for these devices was only for 2 years. There is no luck getting them fixed for free. Since this smartphone is plagued with problems with its flex cable, I tried to change it and also the battery didn't work either. It was bricked. I sold it for pieces. Not everything was lost, at least. 

Another thing that I disliked was its software! Don't get me wrong, but MIUI is nice and easy to deal with, BUT in order to get all of its functions and updates on time (especially the security ones) I had to install Xiaomi.eu ROM (which is based on the official China Rom and no harm done to it's warranty). Sometimes it came with a lot of bugs and we had to rollback the update or only use the stable version. One really bad point was the fact it was only supported for 2 years! Even the camera app was bad IMO, most of the time I used a modded GCam

Physically, the screen was nice, nothing great, but in terms of quality it didn't disappoint me when I was watching media content, only its refresh rate (60Hz) was starting to bother me. The front camera was a motorized pop-up and I never had a problem with it. It had a 3.5mm jack and the Infrared port was really useful and these were the main specs/features I'm missing. The battery was a monster!

What I couldn't get used to was the size, weight, dim screen brightness when in direct sunlight, somewhat mediocre fingerprint scanner (especially with a glass screen protector, lack of water and dust protection, no wireless charging, bad sound quality...

As a substitute, while I was waiting for the S23 and for 3 months, I used the legendary Samsung Galaxy Gio from 2011! With removable battery and FM Radio!! Never forget what they took from us...

**- What were my options?**

* Samsung Galaxy S23
* Samsung Galaxy S23+ (Same as S23, UWB support, awesome battery life, but its size is a disadvantage for me and it was more expensive, good heat dissipation)
* Asus Zenfone 9 (very good reviews all around and one of the best smartphones of 2022, has 3.5mm jack, nice design, ZenUI is near stock android, no wireless charging, but the big no was the fact that it only has 2 years of OS support)
* Pixel 7 (This one was the main competitor for me. It's also an awesome device, slightly heavier and bigger as it sits between S23 and S23+, 700€ for the 8Gb/256Gb version, great camera quality for a smartphone, nice stock experience with zero bloatware updates, pixel devices, the first to try out new OS versions and to update, 3 years of OS update and 5 of security patchs. Why didn't I go for it? The Tensor chipsets still do not have my trust in the long term and for emulating, ""only"" 90 Hz refresh rate (not dynamic), certain software and hardware features are regionally limited.
* OnePlus 11(Bigger and heavier than S23+, only ip64, great display, OS support equals Samsung with 4 years of OS support and 5 years of security patches, wifi 7, USB Type C 2.0 (wtf?), awesome battery life, fast charging (1-100% in 25 min), but damn OxygenOS is just ColorOS at this point, I miss some OnePlus past features.

\- **The choosen one**

Samsung S23. It has everything I need

* Light and compact, damn I was tired of having a ""brick"" inside my pocket. Now, for some sports and outdoors activities, I'm not always thinking I have something limiting my movements and discomforting. Holding it, scrolling and writing effortlessly with one hand makes me appreciate it even more, it feels natural. 
* Love the screen.  Dynamic, 120Hz and 1750 nits (peak), I can see everything under the sunlight (here I'm mainly comparing it to Poco F2 pro). SMOOTH! Damn, I love moving things and scrolling. With the Poco F2 pro, by itself, 60Hz was not a problem... but when I used my PC display (at 165Hz) and had to pick up my smartphone, I always ""twisted my nose"" in disgust. The difference was too big for my liking. Once you go with fast refresh rate displays it is hard to go back.
* In terms of hardware, it's packed with some of the latest guns! Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 slightly overclocked, UFS 4.0,  the only thing I think we should have more is RAM. At least give us 12GB of RAM!!! My emulators are working beautifully (and streaming). Unfortunately, it throttles a little bit under some very heavy tasks, since the S23 is so compact it lacks the heat dissipation the S23+ has!
* IP68 is a good plus! I will not use it to take underwater photos, but having that protection in case something happens, I will be more reassured. I cannot test the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and the tougher (advertised) and scratch resistant body armor... I use a glass screen protector and a case. (more on that below)
* The cameras are not the best, for that, you must choose something like S23 Ultra or the Pixel 7 Pro. Since I take most of my photos with my mirrorless Sony A7 IV, I was not in need of the top of the line camera phone. Nevertheless, it has potential! I still did not test some modified GCam app, but Samsung has everything and processes its images at a very good level! I will test just to see if it differs. When we talk about the main camera, Pixel 7 is still a small step ahead I think (I need to test it more).
* The battery is another great point here! Better than ZenPhone 9, which was my reference for compact smartphones. Not as fast charging as OnePlus devices. This one only goes up 25W when charging with a cable and 15W wireless. I always charge only up to 85% and I try to never go below than 15-20%. I'm not having a problem since I have a very good SOT! Once I do a complete test (100% to zero) I will update this with the results.
* 912€ is not cheap!!! If you can wait for a decent sale, do so! At least I got a 45W wall charger with it and 2 USB cables (one that came inside the S23 box and another inside the charger box)
*  The under-display ultrasonic FC is accurate and FAST. I use a glass screen protector and I have no problem with it, it works almost 100% of the time. 
* Its loud speakers have so much quality when compared to the Poco F2 Pro. I can also compare it to how it sounds versus the iPhone 14 and iPhone wins, but only on the lower frequencies GSMArena has a nice chart about it. The call sound quality is also very good! Does not have the 3.5mm jack port, for some this is a big stepback, but for me it's not so bad since I use wireless earbuds most of the time... still think there is enough space for it.
* In terms of software, in the past, Samsung has been infamous. And this was the point i as more afraid! I still remember using my Note 3 with TouchWiz and the difference it made once I put it with a custom ROM. Performance with One UI 5.1, when compared to the previous versions, improves the experience to a pleasant and natural feeling and I just hope it keeps getting better as time goes on. Nothing to be afraid! But it can get better, Samsung should not be afraid of making it more lightweight!

To end this, I always use it with a case and screen protector. I have no problems with Spigen Liquid Air Case and Ez Fit Glas.tr (FC works as normal). Hope this helps some of you. Will update this once my experience changes or I have more info.",1676479756.0

Restarting( and sorting if the folder was in the app drawer) does fix this. Anyone having this issue?,1676474298.0

iPhone 12 Pro Max 128GB
MagSafe x2
MacBook Pro 2015
AirPods Pro 

I think the S23 ultra looks amazing with the great screen, 120hz and USB C and the stylus is something I would use all the time for work.
The fact I can sideload apps like vanced too really makes me want to switch.


Is it a wise to switch? Or being this deep into the eco system shall I stay?",1676473124.0
S23 Ultra White Balance - Blueish?,9,112zrsw,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/112zrsw/s23_ultra_white_balance_blueish/,8,"I know it's subjective and I know I can adjust for it, but does anyone else think the stock settings on vivid make the whites look a little too Blueish? I have the white balance dead center, adaptive refresh on, and the highest resolution option selected.

I don't have the custom color palate turned on under wallpapers, so I know it's not happening due to that. I don't know my eyes are ust used to my S23 Plus display and they are having a hard time adjusting, or if I need to go into the advance settings and turn down the blue a bit. 

My concern with adjusting my white balance is potentially over adjusting the colors on the photos I edit on my phone.",1676472675.0

I have a Romoss 30k mAh battery with display. It has 18w fast charging capability. But my S22+ only seems to draw 5w from the battery pack. [If youre familiar with this battery pack product, u know u can just click twice to see the A and V power being used at the moment]

*Sometimes, it draws 15W, but only when the display is off which is weird. Moment i press the power button (asin turn on the display), it goes back to 5w. I use the original C to C Samsung cable that came with the phone. I also used a different C to C cable, same thing. I also did use original multiple C to usb A cables and same thing.

I fint it weird because when I had an S21, it draw the full 18W power, thats how i know its not the battery pack with the issue. Is there a way to cater to this?",1676466307.0

Advice for streaming media files to Samsung 2022 Smart TV,4,112x471,samsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/112x471/advice_for_streaming_media_files_to_samsung_2022/,3,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for advice on how to stream media files to my Samsung 2022 Smart TV. I currently use a flash drive and a Fire Stick to watch my downloaded files, but I'd like to have a more convenient and streamlined way to do this. Ideally, I want to be able to torrent files and watch them on my TV through an app on the TV's operating system.

One of my main concerns is being able to wirelessly transfer the files from my computer to my storage solution, or even torrent directly onto a remote server or flash drive that's already available to the TV. Additionally, it would be great if I could wirelessly delete files from that storage solution as well.

I'm not sure if this is possible or what software/hardware solutions would be best for achieving this. If anyone has experience with this or knows of any good resources for setting this up, I would greatly appreciate any advice you could offer. Thank you in advance!",1676464884.0
